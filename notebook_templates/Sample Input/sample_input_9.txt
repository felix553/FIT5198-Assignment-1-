Uber is great!  Great staff/drivers. Cheap prices, very convenient to use....  sometimes can wait a while for a ride depending on time and place of pick up< /Text>

Great people!!  Awsome very quick and helpful!! 😀😀😀
Only bad thing they are pretty hard to find entrance is on different street than the address!!!   😲😲 on 15 th. Street NOT on VERMONT!!!<//review>
</record>

< Text>
Good team, but hard to find. Entrance on 15th. No markers or signs. TIP: this is NOT a building. UBER has two containers that they use for their personal to stay dry and warm (heaters).it is right underneath the bridge. North side of 15th. There usually are signs on the fences, advertising to the station inside.</Text>

Extremely bad customer services ever.. 5 days ago I called uber in sf to pick me up. It's very sad this uber guy doesn't speak English so he was lost for bout 15 minutes. By the time he picked me up it was around 1:30 am in the morning. He also need to pick up someone from out a block from me. He dropped this person off crossing the Golden Gate Bridge and we were lost there for another 20 minutes and I was trying my best with my broken Chinese to him.

It took him bout 30-60 minutes to get me home. The next day uber charged me from $9 to $46 dollars due to this guy's poor English and lack of direction. As soon as it shows in my account I reported right away and uber only refund me $25. I'm still fighting for the remainder of $12 dollars.

This is not only once I have had so many problems with uber and I am not going to take uber ever again.< /Review>

Uber's driver support are from another country which they don't know 99.9% what they're talking about. When a driver have questions/query and they give you an answer that has nothing to do with your query/question. Quit using your SOP and maybe you guys should read the driver's query/ questions your selves instead of making the machines do all your work. Get it right people!</Text>

Oh, and behind-the counter...
they also have a small selection of Mexican cosmetic products,  like shampoo and conditioner. Toothpaste and toothbrush,face moisturizer and stomach remedies and others as well..

I'm sure their wine is good though!< /review><UserId.>111827800569486076328</UserId.><Name>Mike Dulak< /Name><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Great family own Vineyard, the owner David was helpful explaining the process of wine making.  The wine tasting is all outside, which gives you the view of the surrounding areas . Trish, the wine tasting manager was Awesome, and yes very knowledgeable with all the wines! Needless to say we left with over $300 worth of wine. Thanks again David , Vindemia Vineyard!< /review>< Pics>

Beautiful view with comfortable outdoor tables .
The gal who served us was nice .
A jug of water would be nice to rinse our glass between wine tasting.
I also recommend to bring a picnic basket of charcuterie .<//Review>

I surprised my wife with a morning balloon ride for our anniversary and I totally knocked it out of the park. We started here at the winery and you will need to get up early but what an amazing experience!! We shared our morning with 2 other couples but we still had plenty of room to take in all the spectacular views and listen to the many stories and some history of the area from our pilot Dave. We got up pretty high but it was so peaceful and quiet you could hardly tell that we went up to around 2000’. The whole crew ensured we had a fantastic experience I couldn’t have made a better choice to celebrate our anniversary. Thanks to the California Dreaming crew and especially Dave who is also the owner of Vindema Winery and shared a lot of interesting facts and insights making this an engaging and enjoyable morning. He also gifted us a bottle of his wine as an anniversary present which was sweet. I highly recommend this experience for any occasion.< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Such a great time here. Called ahead to find out more information but didn't get anyone on the phone so decided to just venture through anyway. Upon arriving into view of the vineyard I received a call back which set the mood for the entire experience. This small winery takes special care of each and every guest, making sure the story of each wine is shared as well explaining most anything to a novice wine drinker such as myself. With multiple terrace areas and seating, it felt quite intimate with passionate workers to share the fruits of the father/son's labor.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My wife and I met my daughter and son-in-law in Temecula, to do a bit of wine tasting.  First stop was Vindemia, a small, beautiful vineyard, with an elevated outdoor tasting area, up on a hill.  We did our regular tastings, and liked 4 out of the 5 Reds we sampled.

That's when the fun began.  The owner/ vintner walked up to the tasting booth and began chatting with us.  He was holding 2 label-less wine bottles.  This guy was super friendly, and animated. He asked us to do a taste test on these 2 wines he was developing. The owner called them "X and "Y and the letters were marked on the corks.  He poured 2 samples-one for  each couple, and we put our taste buds to work.  We liked X, and my daughter and son-in-law liked Y.

He then asked us if we wanted to try one of his better recent wines, called More Cowbell.  This guy told us he and his buddy came up with the name one night, while getting a little buzzed, sampling this new red he was working on.  His friend said, "I think it needs a little more cowbell, a la the Saturday Night Live skit, with Will Ferrell.  The name stuck!  We tried the 2014, and 2015 More Cowbell, and liked the 2015 one so much we bought a bottle.  It was fun here, and we felt lucky to be able to talk with the creator of tasty wines we've been buying for the past 10 years.  Talk about a personal touch!  You don't get interactions like this at the large wineries.

This little gem is tucked away, up a gravel road, perched on a hillside overlooking the vineyard.  It's always been one of our favorite Temecula wineries.  Please give it a shot.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Vindemia is a lovely location and we were excited to go wine tasting as the Temecula area reopened.   Vindemia decided to celebrate the reopening by increasing their tasting fees to $30 - the most expensive tasting fee - and decrease the number of wines you taste from 5 to 4.   Nothing says "welcome" like charging you more money for less wine.   I recommend going to a different winery.  Vindemia is one to skip.< /Review>

Continually produces fantastic wines! Gorgeous views and wonderful way to "wine-down" in Temecula.
All outdoor seating. Bring your own picnic or charcuterie and enjoy a wine tasting. Great customer service and if you're lucky, you'll even get a chance to speak with owner and vinter,  Dave! He's happy to pour you a glass!</Review>

This is my go-to winery when folks out to visit. Not only are the wines great, but the views and ambiance are even better. The tasting room is out doors, with furniture spread on different levels within the vineyard. It is actually really cool and so relaxing. You don't get rushed, and there aren't large crowds. It is one of those wineries you just have to know about as tours don't stop here. They also offer hot air ballooning...which I did on my first visit (early in the morning...it was one of the most serene experiences I have ever had).< /Text>

We visited on a Friday morning, right after opening, and basically had the place to ourselves. The outdoor tasting area is wonderful - the views are gorgeous and go very nicely with the wine. Bree helped us with our tasting and was fantastic. She made great recommendations about what to try, answered all our questions about the wine and the vineyard, and was so friendly and kind. We also enjoyed all the wines we tasted, and I am generally very picky about wine, so that's saying a lot! I can't recommend this place enough!<//review>

We were bicycling on Saturday and saw a rustic winery so we stopped by and had a wine tasting. The host was so sweet, she offered if we wanted some water first! She was knowledgeable and very personable. Gave us bread and olive oil for clearing the palate between tasting.Their wine were very good, especially the reds. Such a cool spot. We'll be back.<//review>

I really enjoyed the outdoor setting and was impressed by the sauvignon. Reasonable prices too. Probably going to return with our own bottle to picnic sometime just to enjoy the view. Definitely worth checking out.</Review>

If the experience overall had been more positive I would have been able to give them higher marks, as their wines are quite good. Unfortunately the petit verdot was gone, so we did not get a chance to try it. I found the server to be pretentious and pretty high pressure, not the laid back experience that other people have experienced. That sullied my time there significantly. Advertised as a boutique winery it was one of three wineries that we visited this trip. It was by far not the best of the day, therefore I felt they couldn't support the high prices they ask.<//Text>

<review>What a wonderful cellar door and wines! This reminded me of a little place in France with wines to match. Patio seating, beautiful views, no large groups (yay!) and the staff were so friendly and accomodating. Slightly off the beaten track and well worth a visit as a result.<//review></record>

Best wine in Temecula. We came here from Napa to see what was what. They don’t spend on false endorsements or decor. Every varietal was amazing. Come here if you don’t want McGrigio or McCabarnet. Genuinely upset I didn’t come here first and last.</text>

It's a small winery with a really good view and a nice outside patio. The wines are good but $20 for a tasting of 5 wines? Come on! Not even the best wineries in Napa were so expensive. And they are very stingy with the quantity!< /text>

<Text>I suprised my mother for a Mother's Day mini getaway to Temecula Wine Country. We have read the great reviews about Vindemia Winery so we wanted to check it out. As you walk up, you are in awe of the breath taking view of the vineyards. As we approached the outdoor tasting area, we were greeted and instanly felt welcomed. Our server Danielle was very knowledgable and answered any questions we had during our tasting. I have never experienced a wine tasting in the outdoors, but the rose garden made it feel like a fairytale. With the tasting, you get to choose 5 wines and my favorite was the Ruby Royal! This is a must try and it comes with some chocolate too! I highly reccommend this winery if you are looking for a beautiful view with friendly staff to enjoy quality wine!<//Text><user>108897327809810956889<//user><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Refused to toast half of my sandwich even after I explained that I was saving the other half for my lunch. The lady said “I charge you one six inch and another six inch but cost you more money.” I had to pay for extra meat secondary to there NOT being enough to cover the sandwich. The lady also skimped on the toppings. It smells like you incense too. I don’t mind incense but prefer it not to be used in a restaurant due to bread absorbing smells.

Sandwich was good otherwise.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>This store would not accept any promotion and coupons, wrong hours comparing to what is listed online, and always serve half portions on their subs. You want to go to a better subway go to one just less than 1 mile away by the ARCO gas station.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I ordered subs from this store for my company, I believe 18 sandwiches, and the whole experience was wonderful. From the ordering, to the amazing service from the owner, I couldn't be happier. This Subway is clean, fresh and they are there to serve We will be using this store in the future.<//Text>< resp>

$21 for two footlong Cheesesteak sandwiches a quite a bit over price for what the quality of food is that would be a deli or a finer restaurant than Subway charging that price probably won't go there again</Text>

When I began my order she was talking on the phone and I told her it was rude to be on the phone when taking someone's order. She walked of to hang up and when I looked at her she rolled her eyes at me. She was a grown woman too. Won't be returning to this Subway if their employees get away with this.<//Review>

Well, it was all ok until the lady there toasted my sandwich without asking, and slapped everything on my sandwich carelessly. The sandwich didn't taste right, especially the fact she put light mayonnaise instead of regular mayo which I asked for. Over all, bad.</review>

<Text>Although the Subway hours start at 7am on weekdays, they are never open on time. They usually open at 8am (if that). The workers are rude, pushy, and one of them even asked for a customer to close the front door because the AC was on (we are not your workers!). When I told a worker my order, she rang me up for he wrong order and would not change anything! If you want a Subway store that cares about customer service, there’s another one on Hilltop.< /Text><gmapID>0x808577a5ebed2af3:0x9880cc61319ef89a<//gmapID>< pics>

I went there for the Barbacoa and they had live music outside,  I sat inside and waited and waited, I was totally ignored by the owners of the restaurant, if it wasn't for one of the cooks who took my order and brought me the food, no one would've helped me, I also had to asked for a soda after my food arrived! After I finished I waited for over 20 min to see if they would give me the check and nothing!! This place is a joke! To them was more important to sell alcohol to the people outside!!!!!!!< /text>

<time>1534392077247<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I'm a Big fan of this place for a couple of reasons. The A1 Gorgonzola Burger is fantastic.  The restaurant is family owned and they are very pleasant to speak to.  It's a very fair price for Great food.  This is the Shrimp Bruschetta appetizer.  I found a couple of pictures of a double Patty gorgonzola burger that Noe made for me at my last visit.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUrV0InkanvmHdNaeQypn-rUVHx4d63rvuSu0c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFXPWDKOXKyrvgVim-PpYMSf81SbZvjyzrDSw-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvwhNLSLDMWttYiqeMR1qfN5lhPXjnOObSsXQI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Review>First time here. There were only 2 tables set up for dinner. Good thing it was only us and two couples heading to their prom. The beer 🍺 selection was limited. My IPA must have had an IBU rating under 50. My hamburger had a nice bun, but limited flavor despite the gorgonzola and Worcester sauce. My husband liked his steak. Prices were good for dinner.<//Review>< Pictures>

First time. Wonderful employees and really good food. And clean. Just need more Tapas variety  than seafood. People love small plates of cultural foods, and will pay for them, dearly, if it is good. To whomever was cooking Monday night, yum. Thank you</text>

Went here for the Yaymakers paint and sip. What a nice little location and it was very quiet when we first walked in which was very welcoming.  Excellent selection of drinks at the bar too!!!  The bartender knew how to mix the requested cocktails well.< /Review>

Been here about 5x and the food was not bad.  Place is a little gritty for the image it's trying to  project.  The host is super cool and the prices are fair. Place is so close to a 5-star.<//Text>

This is the place to eat, drink cocktails and dance all-night! Unfortunately, it's hidden away from the lights of main street and the Gallo crowd but it is the place worth looking for.<//text>

(Translated by Google) A place to visit. It has character. Yes, a very good bar as well as the service, something they have to work on is very poor security, so I recommend one eye to the cat and another to the scribble.

<Text>Wonderful experience. My beloved son purchased the wrong plants. I called and had a delightful woman Susie, who kindly selected the proper flowers for me. She even brought them out and placed them in my car. I highly recommend them.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>The store is pretty spacious for the area with a lot of variety in plants. The staff is very nice, helpful and go out of their way to ensure you find whatever it is your looking for. Some items (especially non plant items) are a little pricey. But overall for healthy plants and dependable service 2 thumbs up.<//Review>< Rate>

< review>
Susie, the Assistant Manager, is wonderful. She answered all my questions, and made sure I didn't even consider a plant which was wrong for the space I had in mind. She carried the bush I chose to my car and lined the floor with plastic prior to placing the bush in my car.

Sloat has a system where the employees can communicate with each other so if a customer is in need of help there is always a way to get someone to them. I was impressed with how efficient, yet friendly the atmosphere is. I would recommend anyone looking for anything for their garden to give Sloat Garden Center a try.

I purchased a Loropetallum Purple Diamond, picture attached.< /review>

Sloat Concord is a best nursery for those who is building a home garden. Variety of plants is available. More importantly staffs are welcome and helpful. I went there to build my garden which needs more than 20 plants and a tree in multiple quantities. Staff walked thru the shop with me to make sure plants match to my spec per my landscape plan.  Some plants were not in stock but staffs helped me to procure all of them.</text>

<text>Boooo. Overpriced and underwhelming should be their tag-line. Variety is meh but prices are outrageous. Put the money you’d waste here in the gas tank and drive up to any Green Acres location in the Sacramento area. You’ll be happy you did as there’s definitely more selection,  better value for the money, and friendlier staff. I hesitate to say I’d even choose big box stores over Sloat, which is sad.<//text>< pics>

This Sloat Garden Center location is clean, well-organized, staffed with friendly knowledgeable folks and all-around pleasure to browse and shop at.  I recently took a class in Kokedama on a Saturday morning and had a wonderful time.  Dustin was our very patient instructor who helped us create a great moss-covered plant to take home.  I'll be watching my emails more closely looking for information on future opportunities to learn about gardening.< /Review>

Sloat is close to home and very convenient to get to. They stock a comprehensive selection of plants, flower pots, tools, soils as well as plant food and insecticides. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They also offer a rewards program and a yard or space design service with a minimum purchase. Plenty of free parking too.</Review>

Extremely overpriced and terrible customer service!! Would not recommend! I called ahead to check that they had a specific plant in stock and they assured me they had it. When I arrived 45 mins before closing it was dark and their outdoor lights were not working, making it very difficult to find what I was looking for. The woman with glasses was helping customers the entire time I was there. i waited patiently for assistance but once i asked for help she told me to wait and then went to the person behind me. Finally a young man helpes me but turns out they did not actually have what I called about. Just before leaving I remembered one small thing I needed but the woman told me it was now too late and that they were closed.</Text>

<Text>Amazing place
Well stocked and very helpful staff. I miss Navlets but these folks are just as good. You really need to be focused when you go in because you'll leave with more than you planned to.<//Text>< Pics>

Definitely miss Navelet's staff. The reason I was willing to pay more was because of the recommendations and personal service that I received. Went to the newly opened Sloat Garden Center. One person available to answer my questions, and she really didn't want to. I guess we were an imposition. The cashier was about as friendly, sorry we were bothering employees. Last time my husband and I will go there.<//text>

<text>I also miss the Navalet's help.  Also..interesting that the prices are higher as well.  Currently, the store I go to, is moving in more and more decorative pots.  The problem is that the prices are so high that I can't afford them.  I wish they would have more decorative garden statues...not just a couple of buddahs...and bird baths.< /text>< rating>

So disappointing! Very cluttered, overgrown, with many half-dead plants. After waiting in line for too long, finally a 2nd cashier came and took the person behind me to check out. I will not be back!< /review>

Greg the manager at Derrel’s on Panama Lane took the time to show us the different options that were available in storage units. My wife and I chose a 10 x 30 storage unit. Greg explain everything we need to know to get started. It’s people like Greg that make Derrel’s a great place.

<date>1620571320847<//date><rating>5< /rating><Review>We just needed a short term storage unit.  This was very convenient for us,  right on Panama lane.  (and they were having a move in special) Staff was very nice and helpful.  The whole facility was very clean.  We chose Derrels bc all the units are individually alarmed. You have to put in your unit # w your gate code. So if someone enters w their gate code and breaks in to your unit an alarm goes off in the office and they check it out.  The gates are never left wide open,  as they were at other places we checked out.  Very happy w our choice.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1620575582694, 'text': "Thank you so much for your kind words, Sheila Davis.

Great customer service. I would do business with them anytime. Greg took his time on getting me the right storage for what I was putting in storage. I was quote for more due to the size but he found the right size which save me money. The Panama lane location managers are the best.<//Text>

The service was immaculate. We called and reserved two spaces to look at and as soon as we arrived he remembered who we were and immediately took us to look at the units, and was extremely informative and thorough, throughout the process and explained all of the promotions we were getting. The experience was very smooth and seamless. Highly recommend.< /Review>

<text>After waiting in line, I fill out the paperwork and the guy behind the window tells me that I formatted my date wrong and I need to fill it out again. Their is no format shown and as an example military member I did it the same way all government documents are done. He was extremely rude and disrespectful, spend your money elsewhere.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>110509149102595348941</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

To every person who are thinking to use Derrels Storage I will recommend ask first how many break ins they have in the past 12 month, ask how many people lost their belongs. I am a former customer who lost 1000's of dollars due to the careless of Derrel's, ask if the security cameras work, many are out of order, ask if the alarm sensors work or not, if they have security at night, ask what they do if they see someone open your RV or storage. At the time you lost your belongs Derrel's just don't care about it, is like have your important thing in the middle of the field with no supervision, Management is the most careless people when you need them. If you have an RV they basically tell you that they don't care about it (after an incident happen). Please, please if you want to secure your belongs go somewhere else, if not you will remember this review always. Please contact me if you lost your belongs in this place.</Text>

<Text>Prices are a little much. And the outside storage isn't very insulated so everything gets pretty dirty. I would advise you to cover your stuff up or put them in boxes taped up really good. The hours are good and their open everyday 7 to 7<//Text>< name>

The husband and wife in the front office where super nice. Only issue I had was the mice issue while moving out had mice coming out of everywhere, even had mice eat threw my couches smelled like mice urine lost over $3,000 in damages. The storage insurance covers everything but rodents I feel the facility needs to do more about protecting customers from rodents espicially for being on the outskirts of town surrounded by dirt fields. So beware of the rodent issue future and present customers those mice I personally seen run out my storage and into the units near mine.<//review>

<Review>Other than the front desk clerk not allowing my daughter to use the restroom before we purchased a storage, this place is ok. My husband and I were comparing the rates of this location with another storage facility across the street when my daughter needed to use the restroom. When we asked if she could use it, the clerk said it was out of service so we had to go to the Rite Aid down the street. If my husband and I had more time to find a different facility, I would have taken our business somewhere else simply because the restroom was unavailable until we paid for a unit. Seems a little petty but when a potential customer is told something is out of service but really, it's for customers only, it kind of makes you feel mistreated. I honestly wouldn't recommend this particular location to family or friends and I'm considering moving my business to another location when my rental unit is due for payment.</Review>< pictures>

I have to admit, I've only actually ordered one thing here so far, the tofu pad thai. But I have eaten at this restaurant several times, and I really like the food. Atmosphere is kind of generic big Asian restaurant, but it's a very convenient location. It's one of the best Thai restaurants in the area.< /Text>

Come or order from here if you want Thai comfort food and a place to relax. They renovated in the last few years - new chairs, tabletops. It looks great. They have space for anything from casual night out with a cute someone to large groups. Their desserts are incredibly underrated, don't forget about them! Maybe I'll have them again tonight..<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

For the food choice and quality, you can’t beat this restaurant!. It’s always busy, which is a good sign, and the workers are friendly and welcoming. All in all, you will struggle to find a better café anywhere nearby.< /Text>

<Text>This was the first Thai food I had that was disgusting.  I literally had one bite of the rice, spit it out. It had a really funky flavor (it was a side to the chicken, but tasted like it was made with bad fish.  The chicken was overcooked. Didn't think there was such a thing as bad thai food.  Never again.</Text>< pics>

<Review>The Food is off the hook, very tasty, great portions to share, the establishment is clean and they only hung up on me once! Ordered take out, food was hot and ready when I arrived. A little disappointed to only find two shrimp in the chicken & Shrimp fried rice but after one bite I found that the chicken and sausage in the dish along with the shrimp was very filling. We also had the Pad Thai noodles and Angel Wings. All 3 dishes were delish and plentiful for 2 adults and two children to feast on and I have left overs for lunch! bonus.</Review>< pictures>

I came here today for the first time the food was good but customer service was terrible we waited for like an hour to the soup and we waited another half hour and never got our rice and when we asked the employee said I’m going to check and never came back and than someone who came after us got there food first and I believe they got out rice we had order. And the Employee said we can cancel the rice.
I don’t recommend this place because you will wait for along time. I will never come back.<//Review>

Very fresh flavors. And spicy which is good thing if you love spicy food. Like the minty combination too and big portions. Great if you like coming with company that way you can order multiple plates and share them!< /Text>

<text>The food in my opinion was average with your typical Thai restaurant. I've definitely had some better Thai before, but overall the experience was great; lots of parking, quick friendly service, nice music, calming atmosphere, and an $8 lunch special (why they don't give you a salad and soup when you take-out boggles my mind!) (Don't you want to encourage people to take-out? it's less work and more profit for a restaurant!)</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>108538663549541046160</user><Text>We went with a guest of ours on a slow Monday. The server took the order and we ordered one curry mild and one spicy. Our guest went to the register and gave his credit card without our notice as he wished to pay for the food. We found out when my husband went to give his card too.
The food came and the spicy curry was too spicy for us to eat, so we requested the server to modify the curry to little less spicy if she could. She got so mad and started arguing that they cannot do it and it was our fault that we ordered spicy. We had just requested if she could but she was so rude and literally kept arguing even if we said it was okay,we can order other mild one.
10 minutes after the food was on the table, she brought the check without even asking us if we wanted to order any desert or anything else. We felt it was rushed. Again to our greatest surprise there were 4 different bills and when we asked why, she said she kept charging the card as and when we ordered different items??????????? saw it first time in my lifetime the way the bill was broken into 4 parts :(
We expressed our opinion that the it was weird and our overall experience was disappointing and she was rude. On hearing this, the server started arguing on the top of her voice and it was very embarrassing, we called the owner. He said the girl had a bad day so let it go (????????) She was still calling names in Thai language in a very loud and insulting way and kept talking until we left. We have never had such experience even in a road side or smallest restaurant  in our life. Our guest was so shocked ! the bitter experience will always remain in our hearts.this place has to have lowest grade despite how good the food is.< /Text></record>

I take a lot of people here from out of town and everyone loves the spicy mint noodles.  It is very well priced with cozy clean booths and a real family feel.  Only time I was unhappy their air conditioning had gone out.  Great Place try it.< /Text>

<text>I love their Spicy noodles and the flavor is just perfect. Their pineapple fried rice can have more pineapple and more spice, but that doesn't take away any star. This is a fast service,  good quality food restaurant with ample seating and a good ambience.

<Review>Easily my favorite Thai restaurant, and I've only eaten there once.  Atmosphere is comfortable and quiet. Service was quick and very friendly.   Best of all, the food was superb (which is not a word I often use).

I had the Panang Curry, and it was hands down the best curry I've ever had.  It was well presented, and it was obvious that the cook took no short-cuts when preparing it. It was also refreshingly spicy unlike other restaurants which seem to have a spice scale of  Milk -> Yogurt. Its not enough to make you burn, but it was a nice kick.

Prices are about average when compared to other Thai restaurants in the area, but considering the above, id say its a bargain.</Review><rating>5< /rating><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Time>1389851098140< /Time>< userid>

<text>This place is really hit and miss.  Somethings are pretty good, while others are just awful.  Green curry is usually my favorite Thai dish, but this place is all sorts of yuk!  The crispy catfish with curry (red) is delicious, though.  So if you know what to order, you might be happy. If you're looking for a place that will be great no matter what you order, this isn't it.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

New owner. Lots of thugs come here lately. Stay away or you might get hurt. Food is getting expensive and not as good as a few years ago. It used to be inexpensive and tasty. Not so much any more.< /review>

< review>
Sat at table forever. Wait staff says hello and thank you but seems very lacadasical with an assumptive attitude that customers will keep coming back despite poor service. After 5 minutes, I had to walk to counter to ask if we could order. Later during the meal, I had to ask for another water. The service is subpar as waiters DO NOT anticipate and or care about guest needs. The food was okay kind of bland. Won't be back.< /review>

<userid>110761309798502260750</userid><Resp>None</Resp><Name>Gabriel Saldana<//Name><date>1544505897944</date><review>So I've been coming to this restaurant for about 3yrs now, I haven't been here in about 6 months. So my friend and I came tonight and for the first time I  can say I did not enjoy the food and certainly not one of the servers that was there. The food was absolutely not what it used to be I just about get the same food everytime. Cream cheese wontons, fish cake for an appetizer and had Spicy Coconut Soup, Pad Thai  Noodles and for the 1st time tried Spicy Chicken and Shrimp with Green Beans with a Thai Tea. Literally the only things that tasted the same was the Thai Tea and the Thai Noodles that's it. To top it off one of the new server was being rude for no apparent reason, which I called her out on her attitude and set her straight real quick because I didn't appreciate her tone of voice and her attitude. "Everytime" my friends and I come we spent no less then $100 so we definitely won't be coming back here again. To the restaurant owners "Best of luck next time on hiring a new server, you loose her 👎 before you loose more customers, just a thought."< /review><gmap_id>0x80dd28a80d3694db:0x1856a806dae34dd7< /gmap_id>< rating>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>this place has gone down....the papaya salad's dressing was just plain vinegar, I never had such a bad papaya salad, even myself can make a better one. The quantity is cut in half, you pay for a child's portion now...
if you love Thai food, this place is not for you...tastes like it's catered to people who never had Thai food thus would not know any better. Very disappointed... almost insulted they think their food is authentic. You should go to Jumpathai( Brookhurst and Chapman), you  will know what Thai food is supposed to taste like.  I had to give  a star to post this review.<//text>< time>

The fried trout with little mango strips/sauce cost about $19 and some change and was served without rice.  Rice was side order and cost $1.50 for 2 cups.  With soup, it cost me a total of $39 and some change with $6 tip.    Expensive!</review>

<Text>i complained that their food was not spicy enough. When i went back they remembered me and i told them to use fresh thai chili not red flakes. They used only flakes, servered the rice much after the other food, did not give us water, thats right not once in the meal even after the water guy went by and noticed we didnt have any.  better thai up the street</Text>< Pictures>

Customer service is great here. Very welcoming smiles all around. Tracey is such a great help. She answered all the questions I had small or big. Helped me with the app when I was unsure on how to go about it & even helped me when I switch over cars to see which was the right pricing for me. I would for sure recommend her to all my friends & family. Great place for insurance!!!!< /Review>

I've been with acceptance for 10 years with no problems and sorry to leave to another insurance but wanted to try another insurer that was very similar coverage. Tracey Ortiz has been very professional and courteous with me every time I visited the office and made this transition easy for me. Thank you acceptance for the years of good service.< /Text>

<review>Tracey Ortiz is an outstanding professional agent. She goes the extra mile to help with any situation and gets the job done, with a smile. I would recommend Acceptance Insurance to anyone and everyone. Tracey can get you the lowest prices and have you insured in no time. My experience has been awesome and worry and hassle free for years.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>It was a little difficult at first to speak with a person at this location about a quote. However  once I spoke with Tracey Ortiz she gave me a quote over the phone within minutes. She was also at the office the following morning on Saturday. I went in and in less than ten minutes had insurance at a good rate. So far so good!<//Text>< pictures>

Acceptance insurance is a great place to get Auto
Commercial, Homeowners, Motorcycle, Pet, Renters, Roadside Assistance, and etc. Agent Pao has been very helpful and generous about the types of insurances they have and taking his time to elaborate. I was able to get an auto insurance for a decent price that isn't over my budget. Great work Agent Pao and thank you.<//text>

On July 30 2019, Ms. Tracey Ortiz who is  intelligent and beautiful who helped me to get the lowest price with best policy for my home insurance in her company E Kings Canyon.
Next year around April,  I will switch my auto insurance from my old insurance company to Acceptance Insurance in 5247 E Kings Canyon suite 103. I recommend you try to get the quote from Ms. Tracey. You will see it from your quote.
Acceptance was managed by Mr.  Pao Vang, and his policy to his workers is low price,  low fees,  great customer service,  and friendly staff. Ms. Tracey did the excellent  job under Mr.  Vang's guideline. Mr. Vang will help any clients  to find the better quote for all different insurance need. Mr.  Vang helped me to get the merchandise to fix my home(friendly service).  Thanks Tracey and Vang.

Bests,

My parents went in to help start my insurance plan as I could not go in on my own due to school and he was able to explain things to both of them and with me when I called for clarifications. He also provided a very good plan and I couldn't have put in more trust in his decision with presenting the plan. If you're looking for a good insurance with patient and trustworthy agents like Pao, I would go to the Acceptance Insurance on Kings Canyon.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Pao vang is a very professional auto insurance agent that cares for his clients. There were multiple times when I had issue regarding my Insurance he would give me his direct cell phone so that I can get a hold of him weather is was his day off or not he would always pick up and help whatever questions I had in mind. Thanks Pao Vang for your great outstanding work ethic and professionalism that during my time when I was in California that I can trust you and your company with my auto Insurance.</text>

This is a great place to get insurance. As soon as I walked through the door I was greeted with a smile and friendliness. I just have to say Pao is very friendly, professional,  helpful, and gave me great service as I signed up for car insurance. He helped me get the very best rate for my car insurance and did not rush me. I recieved very friendly proffessional help from Tracy as well. I would recommend all my friends, family, and anyone else looking for a great place to sign up for insurance to go here! I will not go anywhere else!😊< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Excellent service with TRACEY (bilingual) gives you completely all the necessary information, and all possible options, especially which suits you, have patience, and look for the most economical but not incomplete insurance, the only thing I did not like was that was confused in my address, and I could not recover the small savings between, but it was in less than 24 hours that the address was solved and I fixed my monthly payments.

<user_name>Lois Sanders< /user_name><Rating>4<//Rating><resp>None<//resp><Review>I have been to both the Sherman oaks location and had to try out the Hollywood location too since I was in the area. It really hit the spot and satisfied my craving. I tried their new wrap with cheese, bomb! I love their fries and fried pickles too. My husband got the wings and those were great tasting too. The parking was a bit of walk but well worth it. The good thing is they are open late till 2am. Staff was friendly. There is a restroom inside for customers.<//Review></record>

Staff was peppy and kept us updated on our order since there was a delay due to the fryer being full. We sat outside in the patio area, which was nice to people watch. The food was pretty good too, but their medium spicy was EXTREMELY spicy for me (and I promise I'm not that weak!!).< /Text>

<text>I cannot say enough good things about this place. Everything about it has been so fresh and so good in the two times I've gone. I get mild and WHEW, baby the FLAVOR! Such good flavorful chicken, fries, AND sauce! Even the pickles are good. And they give you so much food. I definitely recommend this as smackin take-out option!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>A surprisingly good find! Hot fresh chicken with fun flavors. Atmosphere is fun and had Korean music videos that are entertaining. Service was really friendly!  Only downside was the sticky floors and the lack of parking (but understanding because of downtown).</Text>< Name>

Holy f@%k this is good chicken. I didn't understand what this place was for the longest time. An authentic Korean restaurant specializing in fried chicken, ready for watching a game or getting drunk and rowdy during your Hillcrest exploits. They have plenty of alcohol and other offerings besides chicken.

I really underestimated the quality of their chicken offerings. I think this is the most tender and moist chicken I've ever had. I really thought this was a whole in the wall random generic chicken place. So wrong.

Support your amazing local neighborhood ethnic eateries before they're all gone!</review>

The bulgogi fries were crunchy with great texture.  We went during lunch and watched the people traffic through the big windows.<//text>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We dined in and ordered wings and a couple sides. A mug of Hite beer is only $5! The chicken is perfectly fried. Crispy outside, juicy middle. The salt and pepper goes good with beer. And the spicy Korean is sweet with a choice of heat levels. The side salad is big enough for two. We got the sesame dressing, super good. Noodle salad side dish is nice and peppery.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWTUBLl55VW1_QvbLVijpeT2j1k-xUM-XwxwUg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg0K2_IzAkmygDubNkKJ7xF3iZCGtJ2cH-EnaX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWx5YuJgw-5DIdKGl-O1ZfdOyOMMe-iCAPutYB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

The servers and staff are very nice and accommodating, the place has a cool vibe and the food is really, really good.  The chicken is always piping hot and juicy, everything is made to order.  You're not getting something that's been sitting under a warming light for 30 minutes.

Good selection of beer and sake too.

Go check it out, you won't be disappointed!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Got the Chicken Pop, Bulgogi Rice Bowl and the Spicy-Chic Galbi! Bowls were just the right size, the chicken was a good starter, plus priced fair. It was Happy hour when we got here so we got the beer and chicken for 30% off. Would come here again!</Review>

My husband got food from here one night while we were visiting San Diego and he asked me if so wanted anything... I wasn’t very hungry so I said to just order some mozzarella sticks... I took a bite out of the first one and it had NO cheese in it.. just air, literally... the second one? Same thing.. Hand to God, every single one was EMPTY! I was so disappointed and it was too far from our hotel to drive back... won’t go here again. :(< /review>

Great service, great food, great atmosphere even during the middle of a 2020 Pandemic!! Thankyou for going above and beyond and for making dining still enjoyable despite circumstances! The dumplings are amazing and the chicken Bulgogi  was delicious! Highly recommended!< /Review>

We were seated quickly and were served our drink in a timely manner. The server was patient with giving us extra time to pick out our meals. The food was a good portion and came out fresh and hot! I enjoy the atmosphere and I think that is it a fun different type of restaurant to enjoy to change up the paste of your typical sit down dinners.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>The chicken teriyaki is all I get here and it is amazing value! They also put the sauce on the side so you get to pick how much you want on your chicken. Pair it with some mixed veggies and this is one healthy meal! I love that they're open late too for my munchies. This is my new favorite restaurant!</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Def a place to check out! The chicken was perfect on seasoning- i got half_half combo. It was such a free& comfortable layout that we had such a good time drinking soju/beer.<//Text>

<review>The food is good. They have more variety than the pointloma location. Dine in experience was great however,. I highly DO NOT recommend using delivery services. All 3 times I placed delivery through ubereats and grubhub, they did not pay attention to any of the additional notes and didn’t include any of the sides or rice for soup dishes. I made a note to put the KFC sauce on the side and they forgot 2 times I ordered. One time we just didn’t get any sauce at all, the second time, the sauce came on the chicken so by the time it got to my house, it was very soggy.  It was really disappointing bc usually it is crispy and delicious. I called to ask them about their mistake (since it was 3rd time in a row that the order wasn’t right) and the girl I was talking to was very polite, apologized but didn’t do much to fix the situation. Lesson learned. Dine in only< /review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Came here looking for a new fried chicken spot, I think I found it! The prices here are reasonable and food was fresh! Chicken was well cooked, crispy and, I know you probably hate this word, very moist! 😅 Enjoyed the experience, service was great, and food was awesome! I had the KFCB with spicy Korean and bbq which was more than enough food for 2 including leftovers. As other reviewers have mentioned, beware of the spicy! I ordered a 2 and it was comparable to a 4-5. Thanks for the chicken!</review>< date>

<Text>The waitress did either not know enough English or had almost no experience at being a waitress. Ask  them to show you on paper what you ordered. She also put the wrong food in front of the wrong people at my table. That created confusion. Items came out one at a time.  I had cancelled one item right away but it came to my table anyway and it was placed in front of my daughter's chair who had not ordered that item. I ordered broccoli but mostly cabbage was what came.  The beef ribs were good.<//Text>< rating>

<text>The service was good and the food is reasonably priced.  The sweet chili mushrooms have a unique flavor and would be great over rice.  It is served up with crunchy noodles that give the dish a unique texture. The 1/2 rotisserie chicken came with a choice of 2 sides which we chose potatoe and green salad.  The other entree was the salt and pepper chicken wings.  The rotisserie chicken won.  The wings were ok but nothing like the salt and pepper wings you get at some of the Asian restaurants.  They also offer ribs, hamburgers, Korean tacos, and other chicken offerings.  Note that those living in the 92103 area code get a good discount.  Weekday happy hour specials.<//text><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Food: 10/10
Experience: 10/10
Cleanliness: 10/10
Friendliness: 10/10
Wait time: 10/10, only waited about 20-30 minutes.
Went there around night time and had such a great experience! :D
Firstly, my family and I were trying to figure out where to eat for my birthday and every time we passed this place it kept playing my favourite songs or it was a little empty, which we like, so eventually we gave in and went there.
Best choice ever to be honest!
I have no complaints at all and the waitress was so nice!
It was very quiet, but I personally rather have it that way.
I was also with my family so it was even more special.
I’d love to go here again and take my boyfriend to go try it out! :)
I had the beef tariyaki, macaroni, and and rice. It was delicious. Yummmm.</text>

<Text>The chicken was overcooked and dry.  Corn was a frozen variety, mushy and tasteless.  Cole slaw was underdressed and tasteless. Could have gone to Von's and had a better chicken meal for a lot less.

Great food, eclectic menu but it's all tasty. The bulgogi and gyoza were both amazing.</Review>

I'm glad I went back to try the food again. Because I  barely remember eating there the first time.  Both times we got the rotisserie chicken (Yummmmmy) and cheese corn (hot plate+corn+melted Jack cheese?= delicious!). The second time I tried the Bulgogi fries (with tasty bulgogi beef, sauteed veggies,  and next time I'll make sure to get them with cheese).

My friend ordered the teriyaki lunch special and it looked delicious).
A permanent stop whenever we go to San Diego 🤤❤🤤</Review></record>

<text>They had great Korean Spicy chicken wings, and the Bulgogi fries were excellent as well.

They also offer lots of soju options and also have Hite, a classic Korean beer that I kind of missed. I'll definitely be back for more.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Stopped here randomly while visiting from out of town. My party was skeptical at first of an "Asian fusion rotisserie" chicken, boasting "best teriyaki" in town; but we were pleasantly surprised. The teriyaki wasn't too sweet, nor too salty.  Our knowledgible server heath, pointed us in the right direction, reccomending good sides. The garlic veggies werent over done, and the macaroni salad was of a consistancy and flavour you'd expect from a "cook out" if you know what i mean my brotha. I would definitely stop here again on my next visit. Prices were fair for portions served, get the whole chicken, because like you're last intimate relationship, you'll miss it when it's gone<//Text>

Ed was an amazing coach! He made me feel comfortable and confident while driving while also making sure I was safe. With him, I was able to overcome a lot of my fears about driving. One of my biggest fears was learning to drive out of my residential area. During my first lesson, I was able to not only leave my residential area but learn lane changes and many other useful driving techniques. Overall, it was a very comfortable and educational experience and I can't wait to request him for my next lesson.< /text>

Ed was my coach for 4/6 of my driving lessons and he really helped encourage me to the point I am at today! On my first lesson I was too afraid to even drive in the parking lot and now a lot of our lessons were spent on the freeway! Ed is communicative and very helpful, he took efforts to make sure i was happy with my lessons. I’m hours away from my exam and I am very confident in my driving now due to Ed’s methods of instruction. I highly recommend requesting Ed to be your instructor, especially if you’re a beginner like I was.</text>

Ed was an awesome instructor and I would definitely recommend. He was truly clear, helpful, patient, and kind. He went through everything with great enthusiasm and patience. He even gave me things to work on and told me the things I was good at. With a great attitude and a comfortable environment, Ed made my first driving lesson definitely useful and memorable.<//Review>

I had my first lesson with Hong today and I was pretty nervous at first, but after a couple minutes I was totally comfortable driving the car. He’s very communicative and helps you when you need it. He’s also very good at calming your nerves and making sure you have fun while learning. Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend him to a new driver.</text>

I took two driving lessons- one from Don and one from Ed- two days before my driving test. They were both informative, patient, and gave good constructive advice. They were able to pinpoint exactly what I needed to improve on and helped me fix my mistakes very close to my test. I’m grateful to them for helping me pass my test with ease!</Review>

Was a little nervous about driving on the road for the first time, but my driving instructor Ed, was very nice and made me feel comfortable in my first on the road experience. He made sure everything was sanitized and took his teaching at a slow pace and always made sure that I knew what he was teaching. He was very patient and very kind throughout the whole lesson. Would highly recommend him.< /text>

My driving lesson with Ed was so great! I felt very comfortable on the road with him and he was very open to answering any questions I had. He told me what things I needed to work on as we were going, which I really appreciated. He made sure to give me constructive criticism and feedback that I thought helped me improve throughout the drive. He made sure I was having fun throughout the lesson and had a very calm approach to everything. My lesson with Ed helped me be more aware of the things I need to work on but he also recognized the things I did well! Overall, I really appreciated and enjoyed this helpful learning experience.<//Review>

<Review>Ed was a very detailed instructor. He was always calm and respectful. He guided me on turns ahead of time, I never felt rushed to do anything. He taught me so much and reinforced it, making sure I heard it many times so that I would memorize it. He also gave tips for the drivers test and things to look out for. He was very detailed, fun and gave a great lesson. Thanks Ed u the man.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I just had a very professional and insightful experience with Mr.Hong during the driving lesson. He has taught me how to park in a parking lot and parallel park as well as help and review my driving skills for my practical driving test. Overall, he is a great instructor who teaches very effectively. Thank you!</Text><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

Ed was a great instructor. Coming from outside the US, I was nervous to drive for the first time here. Ed covered everything important about California roads in our class! He gives good constructive feedback. He also taught me hand signals, which I didn’t know. 10/10 I highly recommend him for anyone who wants to either brush up and get some practice or for those who are just starting out. Ed knows how to guide the class based on your driving experience. Awesome class!<//review>

Let me just first say WOW! I’m so glad I choose varsity to learn how to drive, my driving instructor was Ed and he was amazing! I was nervous to drive on the road like anyone would be on their first time but he truly was an amazing teacher. He was really through and detailed with my lesson and he really goes over all the basics and tells you exactly what you need to pass your drivers test. I had a ton of questions but he answered them all and made sure to repeat and take time to teach me what I didn’t understand or was having trouble with.  He was extremely patient and I feel like I learned so much throughout my lesson with him. If you decide to go to Varsity please request Ed you’ll learn so much in such a short span of time!</Text>

<Review>I had Ed as my instructor, he was amazing! He was super calm and a very good teacher. He made sure to correct me but not to scare me while doing it. He is very good for your first time on the road. He walked me through everything and made me very calm. I was nervous at first but by the end he made me feel very comfortable.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

He was very well informed, was willing to answer all my questions, and even demonstrated a new skill- parallel parking- before I tried so I would not be nervous. His patience and clear communication of all the instructions made this my best lesson yet! Thank you Hong!<//Review><Rating>5</Rating>< UserId.>

Ed was such a great instructor. This was my first time driving, and he made sure I was comfortable with driving in residential areas before I went out on the main roads. He was super nice and understanding when I made mistakes. He always asked how I was feeling and if I was comfortable with doing anything outside of my comfort zone. I would definitely recommend Ed as an instructor!!< /text>

<Text>Today I had my first driving lesson and I couldn't be any more nervous. My instructor Ed though still managed to give me the confidence I needed to drive safely. I have never felt so confidence and safe at the same time. Ed's encouragement and involvement made me realize that driving isn't that stressful. Ed is a wonderful instructor and someone I will definitely be asking for in the future.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I had an appointment with Ed today. He was a great teacher and really made me feel safe and calm during my first time driving on the streets. We kept talking about different things and he made me feel comfortable and made it feel natural. Great communicator and super cool. 10/10 would highly recommend!< /Review>

During my first lesson with Hong, I really enjoyed the way that he taught. I felt like I was safe for the entire 2 hours, and I felt like I truly learned something out of the whole experienced. He always put an emphasis on safety and made sure to point out both the things I was doing wrong and right. I will be sure to book my second lesson with him again.<//Text>

Ed was a very good coach! I thought it was very nice that he provided wipes to be covid safe, and that definitely made me feel more comfortable. He coached very well, and now I am much more confident in my driving skills. I had never driven before, but by the end of the lesson I was driving well on the main road. He made sure to always give positive feedback and tell me what to do in different situations. Overall, Ed is a great coach, would definitely recommend.</Review>

<Text>Ed was an amazing instructor. When I first entered the car, I was extremely nervous about driving for only the second time. But Ed helped me the entire time, and did an excellent job of helping me not stress out about every little thing. I thought that driving on a normal road alongside traffic would be a terrifying, difficult experience, but Ed guided and encouraged me on every step of the way. Overall, I had an outstanding experience with Ed as my instructor, and I would recommend him to anyone who asked.< /Text>< Pictures>

My driving lesson with Hong was very great! I was  comfortable on the road driving with him. He was very open to answering any questions I had. I really liked how he told me what things I needed to work on as we were going. I appreciated his constructive criticism and feedback as that will help me improve as a driver. I felt so much more confident about driving after this two hour lesson. If you decide to go to Varsity request Hong because you will learn so much in 2 hours.</Text>

I felt confident at the end of the lesson that I would pass my test and he even had a kind trainee named haylie who provided important feedback to complete my training.

<Text>Ed was a very helpful and insightful instructor. My lesson with him went very smoothly and we spent a lot of time correcting my small errors along the way. The way he corrects my driving is very detailed and his positive affirmations showed me that I was improving throughout my lesson. Ed is a very patient instructor and not once did I feel rushed or pressured. I definitely recommend Varsity Driving Academy and choosing Ed as your instructor.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dcddb056dafeab:0x86dae8fdfafcc2f2<//gmapID><username>Patrick Sampouw</username>< rate>

<Text>I had a driving lesson with Ed today. He was very nice to me when he greeted me and kindly offered me wipes to sanitize the car to maintain safety during these times. Before we started driving, he perfectly explained everything about the car and the rules of the road, and answered many questions I had. When we started driving, he was very calm and kept his composure, and was very nice when I made mistakes and taught me how to correct them kindly. During the drive he made me feel comfortable by asking about me and having conversations with me. I now feel much more comfortable driving and I’ll be excited to drive more often.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

My first lesson with Ed was great! The setup was clean and I was given wipes to sanitize the car for extra precaution. Ed was not only informative, but calm. I felt confident that I was learning the basics well and trusted that I would be safe under his direction. He made sure I was comfortable, felt good, and understood the basics. I already feel more confident in my driving after this first lesson and I’m excited to get out on the road!<//text>

I had multiple instructors and all of them were helpful. They were very friendly, experienced, and also answered all the questions I had.
I practiced on local roads, as well as freeways.
The school also set for me the DMV behind the wheel test date, so, I drove the Varsity car there, which made me more confident, comparing to my parent's car.
Thanks to the Varsity team, I passed my test first try!< /text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Ed was an amazing driving instructor. He understood when I messed up and gave me a lot of confidence. He understood when I was nervous and helped me conquer that feeling by staying positive, and giving great communication. He was very understanding throughout the entire experience and I still am mindblown how far I drove! I highly recommend Ed as an instructor.<//Text>< UserId.>

Kam was the driving instructor for my first lesson, and he was absolutely great. He was very communicative and made sure I understood procedures from the handbook before I started driving. He was calm throughout the entire lesson and was encouraging. He was able to make driving for the first time as easy and safe as possible. He even stayed overtime to answer my questions. It was an outstanding experience, and I have no regrets.</text>

Ed was such an amazing instructor! From the start he made sure to make me feel comfortable with the setup and sanitize the car for both of our safety’s. He stayed calm and positive the entire time, kindly calling out and correcting my mistakes while also encouraging me when I did something correct. I felt comfortable asking him any questions and overall feel much better prepared for the driver’s text and just driving in general.< /review>

Ed was an overall great driving instructor. We got into the car and I was nervous about driving since it was going to be the first time driving outside a parking lot. We reviewed all the controls in the car and we made the vehicle COVID safe with wiping everything down. As time passed Ed was helping me with common mistakes that I was making and was very helpful, he explained all the procedures to do on the road for me carry them out. Overall a great instructor, patient and friendly. I am now more comfortable to drive on the roads.<//text>

I just had my third driving lesson today with Hong Tran and feel much more confident driving than I did before.  He was great at explaining techniques and information that I’m sure will help me do great on my test next week! Varsity Driving Academy has made driving go from an unachievable and daunting goal to becoming something understandable and even fun!< /text>

I had a second lesson with Hong Tran today. He helped me not be afraid of the freeway and helped me see what I needed to keep correcting on my driving. He made me feel confident and helped me navigate during the freeway. I would recommend him to everybody who really needs someone to push them to not be afraid! He was very nice and professional and it was a very great lesson.<//Text>

We went over the basics of the car mechanics before we started on the road so I could get to know my surroundings well. Of course, I made mistakes, but instead of scolding me, Ed made sure I knew how to correct my errors so I was confident in redoing what I needed to do without fail! I knew that Ed only wanted to make me feel comfortable on the road, so I didn’t feel pressured to get everything correct, which calmed my nerves and made driving feel fun. 10/10 first driving lesson! :))< /Text>< pics>

<text>Varsity Driving Academy is an amazing driving school. Their costumer service is very helpful and tends to your every needs. I had my first lesson with Hong and he taught me many useful techniques such as SMOG and how to correctly pull into a curb. He makes the drive very interested and fun. He was really calm and gave me great tips on how to successfully maneuver my way on the streets. After my lesson with him, I feel a lot more secure and confident on the road. I would definitely recommend him as a driving instructor.< /text>< pics>

<text>Ed was an amazing instructor, he took me to the dmv for my behind the wheel and made sure I was ready for the test. Super supportive the entire time. I felt very confident for my exam. Amazing experience and I passed!

Khoa was my driving instructor for my regular lessons and helped me so so much! When I started driving I was very anxious and before the end of my first lesson I was driving on the freeway with ease. Such an awesome instructor.

Thank you so much Ed and Khoa!! I would recommend them both to anyone!!< /text>< resp>

I had a driving lesson with Ed today. Ed is the best of the best!!! He understands what it means to treat others with respect. Giving strong direction while keeping a collected presence. He helped me improve my driving skills on regular roads and on the freeway and I’ve never felt more confident in my own driving abilities. I’m really impressed with the way varsity and Ed follow the covid-19 protocols, supplying wipes and hand sanitizer. 10/10 would highly recommend👍🏼< /text>

I had Ed as my first driving lesson instructor today and he is very easy going and takes away the nerves of getting out on the road for the first time. He is a very good teacher and eases you into the basics and more advanced sides of driving throughout the lesson, he also makes sure to take COVID precautions like clear barriers in the car, and provides sanitizing wipes to wipe down the car with before you start driving. Overall he was a pleasure to learn how to drive with!< /text>

My instructor, Ed, for my first lesson was very nice and forthcoming, and he was very patient and understanding, as it was my first time. He wasn’t afraid to make a comment from time to time to improve my driving, but gave me lots of advice and really taught me how to drive. I would defidently and highly recommend his services to anyone just starting out driving and interested in receiving a lesson.</review>

<Text>Ed was a great instructor he made sure I was comfortable throughout the whole lesson and he made sure to compliment so I would feel motivated every time. The lesson was also very COVID friendly as Ed gave me wipes to use before the lesson began. All in all I really enjoyed and thought Ed was a great instructor.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Ed was a great instructor, he taught me almost everything I needed to know, and pointed out my mistakes whenever I made them. His car was very sanitary and I felt very comfortable. He was also very kind, and was very patient! If I ever do another lesson, it would be great to be with him again!<//review>

<Text>Ed was very calm and ready to help when I was having trouble. Wipes were given to sanitize the car so we were covid free. My parents wanted to take a lot of pictures and he was very understanding about it. When I was having trouble with my turns (left and U mostly), Ed gave me tips on how to improve and when to turn the wheel back to it's normal position. We did not go on main roads until he asked that I was ready. As a first lesson, this was a very good experience.</Text>< Pictures>

I had my first driving lesson with Ed, and the lesson was absolutely amazing. I went into this with absolutely no real driving experience and did not expect to learn that much, but Ed is a great communicator and helped me build tremendous confidence on the road. I learned more that I could have imagined in only my first ever lesson. I feel very confident and excited to go out and drive. Thank you!</review>

My driving instructor Anthony, was amazing he was very professional and knowledgeable! For my first time driving I went in uneasy, but after watching Anthony drive and receiving a few simple tips and guides I was comfortable. I learned a lot like the tips on SMOG (signal, mirrors, over the shoulder, and glide over!), and I would definitely recommend Anthony as a driving instructor to anyone as well as Varsity Driving Academy! For my first driving experience it was extremely memorable!

My third lesson with Hong Tran was incredible. He was patient and knowledgeable about the ins and outs of the driver’s test and had solid and easy to grasp techniques that made parking specifically a breeze. He also taught me how to reverse into a parking spot even though that’s not on the test, it’s just cool to know how to do it. Highly recommend Varsity Driving Academy, and ask for Hong Tran if you get the chance! :D< /review>

Ed was such an awesome instructor! I felt so comfortable he was so kind and patient. He took all fear out of driving,  I am so looking forward to the next lesson. He also followed all Covid protocol as well and provided wipes to wipe down the steering wheel, handles, etc. He kindly pointed out my errors and was very kind!< /review>

My first driving lesson with Ed was much easier and digestible than i expected. Probably like most of his other kids i went into this having never drove a car in my life and i ended the lesson feeling comfortable and excited. Ed was clear and helpful on everything and this lesson was like learning to ride a bike.<//Text>

I had my last lesson with Mr. Hong, and he was definitely the most helpful of the three instructors. The entire course has been very helpful, and all the instructors were very friendly and patient. However, so far Mr. Hong was the most detailed in explaining things and giving examples before having me attempt something. A very friendly man overall, I would recommend him as a instructor for anyone who needs help or is nervous about driving.< /text>

<review>I had my first varsity driving academy instructor practice. My driving instructor was Ed! My experience was amazing! He taught me so much. I feel like I could drive safely and more confident. His coaching style is really supportive and caring but at the same time serious. He taught me new things that I would have not know if he didn’t tell me. I really appreciate him!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is my first experience with Mr. Hong. Also this is first time of me driving. I have learned a lot from him, also I gained some new info on how to drive on a vehicle. This academy is worth going into. There is quality time to increase your knowledge in driving as well as your spirit. I have learned a lot from just one class.<//review>< user_name>

My son had today the first behind the wheel driving class with Mr. Hong Tran and he enjoyed it. The instructor was very encouraging, calm and patient. He gave plenty of explanations to my son and repeated the instructions to enforce new driving habits. We were provided with a list of strengths and recommendations for improvement. My son is happy with Varsity Driving Academy and with the professionalism of its instructors.</Review>

This was my first lesson with Ed in April. This was my first time driving in over an year. Ed was patient and made me feel comfortable and confident driving . He made sure I do not skip steps and stay focused on the road . He was constantly making sure I was driving in a safe and defensive manner. He helped me with my weaknesses with patience . 100% recommended! Thank you Varsity and Ed!

I took another class with Ricardo Servin in June. He succesfully built on Ed's lessons. He made me comfortable and offered important tips on how to park and also effectively drive on free way. His lessons on turns, lane changes and parking helped me learn a lot of strategies. 100% recommend classes with Ricardo Servin<//text>

<Review>My instructor, Hong Tran, was great! His instruction was very helpful, he gave good advice on things to avoid even if I wasn't in danger of doing them. He gave reasoning behind why we do things like have enough space between cars when stopped at a stop light (in case we get rear ended, you don't hit the car in front of you). He was very calm and gave directions for where to go very early, which is very helpful. He also very clearly explained and showed me how to do things, and wasn't mad if I didn't know the answer to one of his questions. Overall, very good experience!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

My first lesson with Hong today went very well. I used to be nervous on the road but he built up my confidence patiently by taking me through parking lot, residence, then finally onto the road. The constant communication and instructions, as well as the COVID-19 safety procedures, made me feel safe and confortable at all times. Great lesson and instructor!<//Text>

<review>I had my first class with Connor and just finished my second class with Kam. I was nervous at first, but both classes were very smooth and my instructors were both professional. I was able to relax under their construction and received good tips from both of them. I have definitely become a better driver already with just two classes. Would definitely recommend.

I had my 5th lesson with Hong Tran and the way he taught was really nice. I got a lot of experience from it because he had me do a lot of different things that I hadn’t done before and explained things step by step.<//Review>

This is Sam, and I had my first driving lesson with varsity. My instructor was Ed. It was fun. I was nervous at first and my driving has gotten better. It was my first time on a main road and Ed was very calm and focused on my driving. He was able to give useful tip and advice for U turns and driving along side other drivers. Notifying if I miss information and helping me understand my next motion for good driving. It was fun and Informative. He did pick up his phone a few times but it was fine. Thank you varsity.< /text>

I had a driving lesson today with Ed and it was a wonderful learning experience. He was very patient with me and made sure I was safe and even let me wipe down the car before we started. He made me feel more comfortable while driving and really helped with certain aspects of my driving. I feel like a more skilled driver already and would recommend Ed and Varsity Driving Academy to anyone out there that needs help with driving.</Text>

I have the first lesson with Hong. He is a very good instructor. He is very calm, patient and give me a brief but clear instruction so that I can be confident to drive. Thanks very much for offer the good instructor and service. Will definitely recommend Mr Hong to others.

I have the second lesson with Mr Hong on the next day and get good improvement with further skills like U turn, backing, parking, etc. Mr Hong is very patient to teach and help me to keep up with the driving technique. Really appreciate this.

I’ve finished the last lesson with Mr Hong where he tried to recap all the techniques that he taught me in the previous lesson. As such, he helped me get more confident to drive. What a wonderful teacher!<//text>

<Review>I had a second driving lesson with Hong. Hong really helped me out with my parallel parking and my freeway driving. Overall, he was very communicative with me about how to drive effectively and I was really pleased with his clarifications. Really recommend him and this company! In my last lesson with Hong, he still provided really important information on how the driving test at the DMV works. He ensured that I remain calm and collected even under stress and Hong was very calm after I mistakenly turned into a freeway entrance. Once again, I really recommend Hong and Varsity!<//Review>< pics>

<text>I had my first lesson today with Ed, and he is great! Ed offered me wipes and sanitizer, plus there was a plastic divider between the driver and passenger seats to ensure extra safety precautions regarding COVID-19 (and masks are worn as well). I felt very safe in the car from safety to driving on the road. I feel extremely confident after my lesson with Ed, and he is a great instructor. He was very straight forward on how I can improve my driving to fixing any mistakes made (while also reassuring me I was doing a great job!); after the two hours were over, I feel very assured in my driving!<//text><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I love this driving academy!
I took classes with Anthony, and it was super fun, because he’s super friendly, professional and chill, so that made me feel comfortable while driving.

And also took classes with Sam, he was super cool, he made me feel super comfortable when I was super nervous driving, but he transfer me like a calm and positive vibe so I got less Nervous and stressed!

Both teachers where very professional and friendly they gave me feedback of how get better and what I did good!</text>

My third and final final instructor, Kam Akhavein was absolutely wonderful. Gave me the best guidance and tips for driving, really cared about my abilities and wants to see me and all his other students succeed. He goes the extra mile with printing out paper that easily show me what I do good at and need to work on and he has such a great personality and energy. After my lesson he left me with materials and links to all things needed to know for the final test. Was a pleasure to ride with him and for the price it was an amazing learning experience and I now have so many takeaways for the drivers test, wonderful school and Kam definitely deserves some recognition, would do it over again if I could!<//Review>

I had a third lesson with Hong and he taught me pretty well. I felt a lot more confidence and control with driving by the end of the lesson, and would say that he would probably be a good teacher for everyone.</Text>

I am very comfortable with all the safety features Ed implemented in the car. The car was very clean and disinfected. I was very impressed with Ed’s coaching style, for instance, he taught me many new thing that I never heard off, like how you’re suppose to be 1 car length away from the other car when stopping at a red light. He also helped me improve all the little flaws I had. Varsity is very lucky to have such and incredible instructor like Ed. A big thumbs up from me👍🏻</Review><response>None<//response>< Pictures>

First lesson with Hong, he did a great job telling me what to look for, and just keeping in mind my surroundings. I was surprised, I was able to drive my way back home. I would definitely recommend him, and this driving institution!<//Review>

I was nervous in the beginning, but he was really supportive and made me feel comfortable. He reminded me of important things that will be checked on the test and had a list of things on paper to be careful of so that I can review. Overall, great experience!</Review><userid>105415798005822119991</userid><time>1602129222973</time>< Rate>

<Text>I had two lessons with Cam and both were of superb quality. To start with, he came prepared, with his own condensed guide that touched on everything that was needed. He also made sure to go through every single required procedure as to make sure I would be prepared for the test. Both lessons, he was patient, informative, and entertaining. This review would be the least I could do for such exceptional teaching.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I had my last lesson with Hong, he was fantastic, his ability to clearly communicate driving instructions was the best I’ve ever had, he taught me not only how to pass the driving test but also skills on how to drive throughout life, I would highly recommend!< /text>

I had a second lesson with Hong, and he was really patient and calm. He helped me efficiently and quickly correct my mistakes while driving. His calm demeanor helped me not panic and stay in control of the car. I felt safe and secure throughout the length of my lesson. I learned effective methods and procedures to ensure that I am ready to drive on my own.</review>

I had a first lesson with Hong. He was a very good communicator, very calm and patient with me. He helped me when I made mistakes, small or large, and made nice small talk. Before the lesson, I was extremely nervous, but now, after my lesson I feel more confident in driving and very happy. Highly recommend him as a driving instructor, especially a first driving instructor. :)< /text>

<text>I had my first driving lesson with Kam and it was incredible. He was calm and made me feel confident when driving. I like how he had a guide that went over everything I needed to know. He did a great job making sure I knew what to do and described everything well. Kam also made sure to review important rules for my driving test. He was a very nice, calm, supportive and informative instructor. I absolutely recommend him!!<//text>< Pictures>

I didn’t feel too overwhelmed but yet was able to absorb all of the necessary information given during the lesson. Overall, a great lesson and a great instructor! :)</text>

I just finished my 6 hours behind the wheel training with VDA and my instructor Anthony Becerra was super chill. He’s very attentive and he will have your back no matter what happens. He will try to always keep a smile on your face and he tries to keep a conversation. I definitely made the right choice choosing VDA.</text>

<Text>I had a driving lesson today with Ed as my instructor. It was very covid-friendly, masks on at all times and a plastic barrier between the seats, and everything in the car being wiped down before and after. 100% a worthwhile use of two hours, and I’m much more confident in my driving ability now.</Text>< response>

I had a second lesson with Hong and I really enjoyed it. He made sure that whatever he taught u completely understood and would repeat it until I did. Additionally, he gave me good pointers on driving and was good on reinforcing them. I definitely would recommend Hong as your driving instructor.< /review>

<review>I had my first lesson with Hong. He was very patient and was a good communicator. I was a little timid at first, but he eased me into getting more comfortable.

I had my second lesson with Hong. He helped me get more comfortable with staying up to speed with traffic, and changing lanes more fluidly. He gave me some great tips with parking, and was overall really helpful.<//review>< Resp>

Varsity is awesome. Their dedicated instructors and staff members are very professional and served us well.  Due to Covid 19 there were several schedule changes and they helped us navigate through the difficulty of scheduling and my son passed the road test in first trial. I would recommend Varsity to anyone in OC.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>I’ve had a few lessons with Ed. He gave me a lot of great pointers when I got started which helped pave a foundation for my driving. I also got parking practice and freeway driving which was really helpful. Overall, his coaching style is great and I would recommend him to anyone who is starting out driving and needs some lessons!

Thank you Varsity and Ed! 👍<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Today, I had my behind the wheel test at the San Clemente DMV. I had signed up for the varsity DMV package. I got a call from the varsity instructor Ed yesterday confirming the pickup  time and what to expect. Ed showed up a few minutes early this morning and he was very courteous and professional. He let me drive the car to get warmed up and also gave me last minute very helpful tips. The DMV test went fine and I passed easily. I would like to thank varsity driving school and specially Ed for helping me through the process of learning driving. Coming from outside the US I had to learn the driving and get to understand the rules. Ed is awesome and makes things very easy and simple for me. I also want to thank the varsity office staff. They were very pleasant and getting driving lesson appointments was an easy process. I would rate my overall experience 10/10 👍

I’ve done multiple driving lessons with Ed and he such great instructor and coach. He makes me  very confident on my driving skills with his patience and calm attitude. Everytime he reminds me of the important things that I may forget while I’m driving and he does that very calmly. My driving skills have improved a lot and my confidence has increased thanks to Ed. He is truly the G.O.A.T. I totally recommend Varsity Driving School and Ed 👍</Review>

Hong was an amazing instructor and he helped me learn to drive for the first time! It was a calm and overall incredible experience!

I would also like to mention Jon Sihilling for giving me the confidence to drive independently and teaching me some of the most difficult challenges I faced as a student driver. He gave me a new perspective and the ability to trust myself when driving, which was amazing and helpful. I hope that he gets the recognition he deserves!< /Review>

My instructor, Hong Tran, was very forgiving and didn’t get angry over mistakes, but he made sure that I knew the mistake and corrected it. He was also very good at explaining things in a simpler way. Update from my second lesson, it was very fun and stress-free. Even though we took it onto the freeway, I was not nervous because of his reassurance. He also gave me good advice and fixed my mistakes. Just finished my third lesson and I feel much more confident in my parking and freeway driving skills. I highly recommend driving with Hong Tran as it is stress free, but also a good learning experience.< /review>

I had a driving lesson with Ed and it was my third and final lesson and I couldn’t be happier with my experience. Ed was very helpful and informative regarding driving on the freeway/highway which helped me ease my anxiety about driving on the freeway. He taught me excellent things that I will extend from our lesson together to other aspects of my life. Great job Varsity Driving Academy and thank you Ed!< /review>

2nd lesson with Hong was amazing. Very interactive and demonstrative with practical details that’ll help you on the test and on the road. He’s very friendly and gives you step-by-step processes for skills like parallel parking and goes even further by taking you into the freeway (few instructors do this nowadays). Highly recommend.<//text>

Because of VDA, I became a more confident and defensive driver after each lesson. After 3 lessons, I feel incredibly prepared for my upcoming license exam. Particularly, Ed was a very knowledgeable and excellent instructor allowing me feel safe and comfortable throughout my whole lesson, teaching me the basics as well as tips and tricks. Thanks VDA!<//Text>

I had my third lesson with hong today. We drove on lots of toll lanes as well as how to drive safely on the freeway. We also practiced having google navigation on while driving on the freeway as a way to help us navigate through freeways and toll lanes. I am now more knowledgeable about the freeway enough to educate my mom who is scared and uncomfortable on the freeway! Thank you hong!<//Review>

My fourth lesson was with Hong. I was very satisfied with his teaching and he was an immense help. He demonstrated how to maneuver with a variety of situations and was very clear and what to do AMD when to do it. I strongly recommend Hong to anyone looking for a high quality driving instructor.< /review>

I had a driving lesson with Ed today. He took me on the freeway for the first time and he was a great help and instructor! He coached me on the little things and explained everything thoroughly. He told me all the things I should be looking out for and I had a great time! Would highly recommend Varsity and Ed to others 👍🏾<//Text>

<review>I had a driving lesson today with Ed! First of all I felt very safe being in the car as he was wearing a mask the whole time, there was a plastic divider down, and he had me woo the wheel down with wipes when I first came in so I’d feel more comfortable! Also, Ed was very easy to talk to the whole time and it made my driving a lot easier. I’d recommend him as an instructor!< /review><userid>102191430022662584121< /userid>< resp>

<text>This is Maddie. I had my first driving lesson with Ed. First off, the safety features of this car were amazing. My driving instructor had wipes, a screen separator, hand sanitizer, and we both wore masks. The car I was in was very clean. Secondly, my driving instructor improved my driving skills drastically. He challenged me to learn new helpful things like U-Turns and getting on and off the freeway. He was very calm the whole two hours and made me a better driver by being very alert and explaining things in depth.</text>< Pictures>

I had a driving lesson with Ed today. He showed me so much in the little time I had with him and boosted my confidence for this upcoming driving test. I was really nervous at first and now I have a good chance of passing this test. He corrected all my mistakes and make me feel comfortable while driving with his communication and at ease. He went through all the the varsity checklist in detail and made sure I understood everything. We had extra practice on the things I needed a little work on and now I’m feeling ready. Thank you varsity and Ed👍<//Text>

<Text>This is Adam and I had my first official driving lesson with Ed. Ed made sure that I felt comfortable before entering his car by offering, hand sanitizer, hand wipes, and masks. I appreciate the extra effort in making sure I was as comfortable as can be before starting the lesson. I was a little hesitant at first with going on the main road but I think that was simply because I hadn’t been on the road in a while. Ed engaged in conversations so that it did not just feel like a business without any socializing so I appreciate that component as well.there were different techniques that Ed brought up to my attention about slowly gliding into the other lanes and making turns that made me feel confident after processing his advice. I would highly recommend Ed to any new drivers or teens that are having confidence issues with driving.<//Text>< Pictures>

Today I had my last driving lesson with Ed and he was very helpful and gave me lots of tips on how to become a better driver. He also went over the information on the driving test to help me be able to pass. His car was very clean and he gave me wipes to clean the steering wheel!! I felt very safe in the car and was happy with the precautions taken during Covid-19. I would definitely recommend taking your driving lessons with Ed.</Text>

<text>My name is Liv and I have used Ed for 2 lessons now and I am very impressed on the amount my driving has improved in my four hours spent with Ed. He is very patient and understanding which makes driving with him comfortable and less stressful. He is not harsh when giving instruction. In addition I felt super safe with the safety precautions taken. There was a plexiglass divider, sanitizing wipes, and he wore a mask.

I had a driving lesson with my instructor, Hong Tran, and he was very informative and helpful. I learned a lot from the lesson and he was really patient in teaching me the correct steps and procedures to parking and reversing. Overall it was a really beneficial lesson!< /Text>

I had my first driving lesson and my instructor was Ed. He was very patient and friendly and helped me become more confident on the road. He pushed me out of my comfort zone as well and we even went on the freeway which was very fun. Lastly, he encouraged me and corrected my mistakes so I could improve.< /Review>

I had Kam as my instructor for my third lesson. I have my test coming up very soon and he made sure that I was confident and comfortable with my own driving. He made sure that I was ready for my test and also made my second time on the freeway very easy! He is very patient and compliments on your driving maneuvers which made me feel more confident!< /review>

<name>Jaske Szerenyi</name><Review>I just took my first lesson with an instructor named Hong Tran. He was very good at assessing my skills and giving me valuable advice. I thought he did a good job structuring the lesson. He was very professional in the way he explained the different techniques that he taught me and did a good job at explaining to me how to judge the road and how to be a safe and protective driver. Over all the lesson was very thorough, and was a great first experience into driving academy. I would definitely recommend this driving school. (If you can, ask for Hong Tran as an instructor)<//Review>< Pictures>

I had a 3rd lesson with Hong, he taught me everything I wasn’t sure about and was happy to answer any questions I had.  Anything I requested more practice for he found a good place to do it and taught me step by step the most effective and safest methods.  Finally, the way he taught was kind and effective, without being rude or distracting me in any way.</Text>

First lesson with Hong
Mr. Hong helped me with controlling my fear, being very calm and collective when I was getting nervous and calmed me down
He is professional because he helped me drive the car down roads on my first lesson and brought my confidence up significantly while driving
He communicated with me while I was driving helping  me drive better< /review>

This is Nathan and I had my driving lesson with Ed. He was very helpful throughout my driving and helped get ready for my DMV test too. He made sure that I was making all the thing in order to pass my test. He was very welcoming and my instructor kept me very safe with giving me wipes. All in all great lesson and highly recommend varsity driving and Ed the instructor.< /Review>

<Review>I just had my fourth lesson with Varsity Driving Academy and this time it was an instructor named Jack. By far, this was the best lesson: we went to the DMV and went through the routes, did the basics of the test, strengthened my lane changes, etc. Regarding this instructor Jack, he's the best one I've had so far. He was professional but friendly, and he even supplied and used hand sanitizer, wipes, and a mask, which was very nice considering the current pandemic. He was also very calm and collected so while you drove, even if you aren't the best driver, you'd still feel safe. The 2 hours were well spent and I learned a lot. He spoke kindly of this company showing that Varsity is truly ran properly and the employees are happy.<//Review>< user>

I had a drive lesson this morning with Ed, I liked the fact that he helped me prepared for the test and made sure that if there was anything wrong with my drive he would help correct it. I couldn’t recommend him more as your driving instructor, plus he is very kind and respectful to you as the driver.<//Review>

I had Kam as my instructor. I felt really comfortable during the whole thing. It was my last driving lesson before my test so I was really anxious. But Kam came really prepared and helped me feel like I was more prepared. Varsity Driving Academy, in general, has helped me a lot with my confidence in driving.< /Text>

I had my first driving lesson today with Ed, I felt very comfortable with him and he helped me very much. He challenged me with things that were a bit out of my comfort zone but made me better and specific driving points. Overall great lesson!< /Review>

<text>I had my first driving lesson with Ed today! When I first got in the to start my driving lesson, he offers me wipes, sanitizer, and there was a protective shield to keep us safe healthy! I was also impressed with how amazing of coach he was. In the beginning I was having a little anxiety and very unsure how I was going to do. But by the end I feel more confident and happy to be driving!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>I’m Austin and I had my first Varsity Driving Instruction with my instructor Ed. My instructor Ed was very helpful with teaching me some tips and tricks for when I take my license test at the DMV and made it a very comfortable ride. While in the midst of this crisis, Ed provided me with all the safety precautions including wipes to wipe off the main components of the car I would be touching and there is a plastic screen partially separating us to prevent the spread. Overall the experience was 10/10.</text><Rating>5<//Rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

This is my 4th lesson with Hong. He is a very good instructor and he is very precise in his techniques and gives freedom to the driver. He lets you learn from your mistakes. He demonstrates how it’s done then he lets you try.</review>

<text>I took my lessons with Ed from Varsity and he was very helpful and very friendly. I even requested to have him for all three of my lessons. I was scared to drive in the beginning and he helped me through everything I was scared of doing. I was very comfortable with him and didn’t feel intimidated or nervous because I always knew I could ask questions and that he was there to help. I would definitely recommend taking lessons at Varsity and with Ed.< /text>< Pics>

My name is Stavros I had my first driving lesson with Ed. I felt safe behind the wheel and he was helpful and a good instructor. Varsity also has a lot of safety measures in place. There was a plastic barrier between me and my instructor. My instructor also offered me wipes, gloves, and hand sanitizer. All in all a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend varsity driving academy to my friends and family.<//review>

< Review>
I had a second lesson with Hong and he made the lesson very awkward by telling me all the ways I could fail the test and he was 10 minutes late to the session and asked me to pull into a Target parking lot so he can use the bathroom. He also was very distracting by talking to me while we were at the Oakley headquarters. What concerned me the most as a new driver was that he was unable to find a proper route back to my house and asked me if I knew the way, when we were coming off the toll road. After I suggested a route that I knew to get back to my home because I knew one way from practicing with my parents, he then told me to get off on a different exit which myself and I sensed he was unfamiliar with since he pulled out his phone for google maps. After I gained my familiarity with the area I was in which he did not know I had, I was able to drive back safely. When we were in my home's parking spot, he asked me if I had my phone with me which I did and he almost seemed to demand I give him a rating then and there. I proceeded to give him a five star as he requested, along with a lot of nonsense comments complimenting him, which I have since taken down to explain what really happened, the only good thing about this lesson was teaching me how to park parallel.</Review>

<Text>I had my first driving lesson today with Ed. Ed was very good at communicating with me and letting me know what I was doing right and what I was doing wrong while driving. He helped me stay very calm while I was driving and does his job very well. In this COVID 19 pandemic Ed was very helpful by keeping the car clean and disinfectant.</Text>< Pictures>

The lesson went very smoothly and my instructor was very encouraging and calmly helped me to learn how to drive on the road.

Ed was a great driving instructor - before beginning, I was very nervous and unconfident, but after 2 hours with Ed’s coaching, tips, kindness and assistance, I was able to comfortably drive 60mph - something I never thought I’d be able to do! Ed made things very easy to understand and I feel like I am a much better driver now!< /review>

<text>This was my first driving lesson with Ed and they take covid protection seriously by cleaning it and having a barrier between the us allowing me to focus on driving. Ed's coaching allowed me to drive without constant interference with him only speaking when necessary allowing me to gain confidence in my ability and fix my mistakes. I'd recommend varsity driving to anyone looking for Driver's ED instruction.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I had a driving lesson with Ed today. My mom and are super high risk for catching corona so we requested that the car was corona safe. I really appreciate the car being equipped with plexi glass, wipes, hand sanitizer and if you needed a mask, a mask. I have my driver’s license test coming up and I feel really ready and prepared thanks to Ed’s help. His communication was super clear, his tips made perfect sense and I overall felt super comfortable.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1597251708811, 'text': 'Thank you Sophie!

My son had 6-hr diving lesson w/ Kam.  It was pleasant experience.  Kam is a responsible instructor.  The company staff is also nice.  They call you and remind you about appointment.  They are happy to answer questions that you may have.   My son passes his driving test today.</Review>

My main instructor was Jack. The entire process from excellent, appointments are always available and last for ~2h. They pick you up & both my instructor and myself wore masks, had a plastic divider and used hand sanitizer.

Instructor was very knowledgeable and flexible about routes while still ensuring that I was doing everything correctly. Practiced on almost every major road after the first lesson + practice.

Would highly recommend to anyone who needs driving lessons or is preparing for the DMV test.< /Review>

I had my third lesson with Mr. Kam Akhavein, and seriously, he is the best out of all three instructors I’ve had lessons with.

Mr. Akhavein gives concise and detailed instructions ( which helps make abstract ideas clear to me) and really useful tips that could be applied to the driving license test. He even printed out papers with self-wrote notes to give to me so I could review all the materials later on by myself. Wow. The fact that there weren’t any irrelevant rambles during the lesson is also an add-on to how good he is. By the way, he makes sure that you get the two full hours. And It was indeed two hours of productiveness and focused learning, I really appreciate it.

Apart from being the superb instructor he is, Mr. Akhavein is also an admirably responsible and kind person. I could feel that he wholeheartedly wants his students to succeed. For the price it was an amazing experience, I wish I had him for all three lessons.<//Text>

Varsity Driving Academy has been awesome. My son had such a good experience. All of the instructors were so knowledgeable, on time, kind, and responsive to any of our questions. I am so thrilled to have found this company. My son would leave for his lesson so nervous and he would come home so confident and excited about driving.  My younger son will definitely be enrolling with them next year.< /review>

I had a driving lesson today with Ed. During the COVID-19 virus I felt very safe with the masks, screen protector, and the wipes while driving. The 2 hour lesson I had was fun and very informative I learned how to properly drive on the freeway. Thank you 👍< /text>

<Review>This is Clayton and I had my driving lesson with Ed.
Ed was very professional and kept the car very clean so that I wouldn’t get COVID. He helped me learn on what the dmv expected me to know. His coaching style was very professional and nice. I would recommend Ed for all the teenagers that are trying to get there driving lessons. The car was also very safe it had all the pro caution to be protected from the virus.< /Review>< pics>

< review>
We have used Varsity Driving school for both of our sons' required behind the wheel hours. Our oldest took lessons 7 years ago with Walter and our youngest had Pete as his instructor just a few months ago. I believe Walter is no longer there. Both instructors were knowledgeable and patient. Both our children passed DMV test on the first try. Scheduling driving appointments was easy and the whole experience was positive.<//review>

I had my first driving with Varsity and my driving instructor was Ed. I felt very nervous and scared before I began my driving lesson with Ed. After the lesson I felt very confident and well informed on the topic of driving due to Ed’s teaching style which was very helpful and kind. Ed was a great teacher during my first driving lesson.</review>

This is Christian and today I had a driving lesson with Ed. I was very comfortable because we both had masks and their was a divider between us he also offered me sanitizer and gloves. There was also wipes to wipe down the car. All these features made me fell very safe in the varsity car. I have my dmv test coming up and Ed prepared me very well for the test by giving me good last minute tips. He took me to San Clemente to drive me around the dmv to get more comfortable of the area. After the 2hrs with Ed I feel very prepared and ready for my upcoming test. I highly recommend varsity driving academy to teens who want to learn how to drive.</review>

Before driving I was a bit anxious with driving on the freeway and just driving in general. After my first lesson, I now know so much more than I did prior to driving with Ed. I learned how to drive on the freeway and everything that comes with it (lane changes, distance, speed), and I also learned how to make U-turns, which I had never done before. Ed was great at guiding me where to go and was very understanding and helpful when I made a mistake.

my name is kylie and i got to experience varsity driving academy. i previously had an appointment with another driving school and was unhappy with my experience and was pleasantly surprised with how amazing varsity driving academy was. i was first greeted by Ed with a smile and i was offered gloves, hand sanitizer and the car even had a plastic screen for our protection (as well as masks). my instructor Ed was helpful, and very patient with all the questions i had for him and overall the experience was helpful and can’t wait for my next driving lesson!<//text>

My name is Jackson, and today was my first lesson. My instructor was Ed. I had never been behind the wheel, so starting off I was a little nervous, but I experienced enough to make me feel comfortable and have confidence in my driving ability. Varsity put up a barrier between the front seats, there was hand wipes, there was hand sanitizer and even gloves for me to put on if I so chose. I felt that my safety was taken into consideration and that during the lesson, Varsity was following the COVID regulations.< /review>

I had my first lesson with varsity and my instructor was Ed. Under the Covid-19 circumstances, as soon as I got into the car, we both had masks on, there was plexiglass and he offered me disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer. I felt very secure. Ed was professional and made sure to go through everything I had to learn. Entering the car, I felt super nervous yet by the end of the two hours, I feel very confident driving and I learned a lot of valuable things that I will keep in mind for the future.<//review>

<review>My name is noah, and I had 2 out of my 3 lessons with instructor Ed. He is an amazing instructor who really cares if you are prepared and safe for your driving test. He makes sure before even leaving the parking lot that you know all the features of the car and that you are comfortable. While driving he Dosent startle you’re our shout while driving he keeps you calm and makes sure your know where you are going ahead of time. He clarity’s multiple times to make a left or a right turn. He will make sure you practice everything such as u turns or parking. And give you as many chances you would like to practice what you don’t feel comfortable with. You complements you if you are doing well such as very good and good job! Due to corona many people are scared for contact but Ed makes sure you feel safe he offers wipes, hand sanitizer and gloves so that you are comfortable. On top of all that there is a pastiche see through divider that separates you and your instructor. I feel very prepared for my driving test and am very thankful for my instructor Ed.<//review>< pics>

I highly recommend this driving school to anyone who want their teens or young adults be a safe driver. My son passed the test in his first attempt and not only that, he learned how to be a cautious  and professional driver. Special thanks to kenia for accommodation.
I also want to thank Mr. Bulman, Mr. Cheak, Mr. Oney and Ms. Herrera. You are awesome! Thank you for working  hard  and help others during panademic!< /text>

He is an excellent instructor, who takes the time to walk you through all details and made my son feel very comfortable. If you point out anything you were not too happy about, they will address it right away. My son passed the behind the wheel test at the first try. I would highly recommend Varsity Academy.</Review>< pics>

I had a driving lesson today with Ed and the safety precautions taken to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 such as the plexiglass divider between us as well as the hand sanitizer and wipes provided really made me feel safe during my 2 hours.  He also really helped me touch up on a few spots I was unsure about when it came to my driving, making me feel more prepared for my test.  I feel very prepared for my upcoming DMV test.< /review>

My name is Charlotte and this was my first lesson with Varsity. My instructor was Ed and he was amazing!! Our interaction throughout the two hours put me at ease both with driving the car and in general. Ed was super friendly and made me feel very comfortable during my lesson. His coaching was effective and precise. I felt that I have improved drastically through these two hours. The safety measures due to COVID also helped put me at ease. Upon entering the car both Ed and I wore masks, I was offered wipes to sanitize all parts of the car, and was offered both hand sanitizer as well as gloves. Additionally, there was a piece of plexiglass which divided us but still allowed for proper communication. Although I made mistakes, as any beginning driver does, Ed not only helped correct these, he made me feel safe and was not judgmental which helped. All in all, I had a great time and am looking forward to my next one!<//review>

My name is Marcus i had a driving lesson with Ed. He taught me a lot about what i should be doing and the important parts of road safety and driving going through the mechanics of driving. They made sure we were safe during coronavirus and had a plexiglass shield and they wore mask and gave me wipes to wipe down the car and offered gloves and hand sanitizer at the beginning. He was very helpful in teaching me what do on the road and making sure we were safe during the pandemic and i would definitely  recommend varsity to my friends and family.</Text>

This is Nick and I used varsity for my driving lessons. I thought they were very professional and took every lesson seriously. They were able to teach me the laws of driving and also how to succeed my driving test, as I was able to pass first time. They were able to help me by giving all the tips about the DMV driving test, which were very helpful. I had my DMV test today in Costa Mesa, Ed took me to the DMV. Ed was very courteous and professional, Ed even let me drive for 20 minutes prior to the test and gave me important tips for the test.  Ed offered me wipes and hand sanitizer to keep me safe from the COVID-19 pandemic. I would highly recommend Ed and Varsity Driving to other teenagers who would like to receive driving lessons. A 5 star rating from me.<//Review>

<text>My name is Mike and my instructor was Ed. Ed is the best you can get when it comes to learning everything about driving. I learned so much about driving from Ed and without him, I wouldn’t be where I am today. He is the best coach when it comes to driving. I feel 100% ready for my drivers test because of him. Even though it is during the Covid 19 pandemic, Varsity Driving took every caution possible. We both wore mask, gloves were available, hand sanitizer as well, wipes to clean the driver side, and the plexiglass separating me and Ed. I felt safe in every way. Highly recommend Varsity Driving to anyone out there.< /text>< pics>

<Review>I’m very happy with my Varsity Driving experience, I shared two sessions with Kam, who’s a great guy all around and I can see that he puts a lot of heart and effort into his teachings, lessons and explanations. I’ve never had a teacher who takes the time to write everything out and create a visual for you to see and review, and then put that visual into action via driving. For that I’m very appreciative and thankful I got to share my time with Kam. There were some maneuvers and challenges I was nervous to do (like going on the freeway) but Kam explained it out, told me what to do and what to expect and it turned out as a breeze (not perfect but I’m working on it and will continue to use the maneuvers Kam taught me) and an awesome challenge/ learning experience. I would highly recommend sharing your Varsity Driving experience with Kam!

I’ve had Ed as my driving instructor for a couple of lessons I feel he is very engaged with helping coaching me he will tell me what I do wrong so I can correct my mistakes and he always makes sure I’m going the right speed limit and always in the center of the lanes and he’ll make sure to let me know if I start drifting he’s very aware and he’s helped me greatly so I know I’m going to pass my test.</review>

< Review>
I would highly recommend Varsity. I moved to CA from Manhattan (NYC) and had to learn how to drive at a ripe age!  I did a careful research on line before I picked Varsity (Irvine) based on reviews, instructor profiles and the smooth communication with the scheduling office. I took about 30 lessons with Varsity over the course of 2.5 months and received my driver’s license at first try.  I followed up with a few lessons to improve on freeway driving.
The administration/scheduling office is very competent and incredibly efficient and responsive. They explained the process of getting the license, helped me set up a packed schedule, and were great in accommodating changes.  They are excellent and very organized in communicating schedule and sending lesson reminders.
I had the pleasure of meeting many of the Varsity instructors - all incredibly knowledgeable and professional, each with their style, insights and advice that were remarkably helpful. Each instructor explained things very well and in ways that clicked, and I will remember. A big shout-out and huge thank you to Isaac and Jose with whom I had the most lessons! A big thank you to Michelle, Arturo, Daisy, Kam George, and everyone else. George was a wonderful positive calm presence for the test. I very rarely (almost never) write reviews, but realized how helpful other people’s reviews of driving schools were for me, so here you go.<//Review>

<text>BEYOND AMAZING!!! Katie from Varsity Driving School did what I had been dreading...she taught my son how to drive. My son enjoyed every lesson and passed his behind the wheel test the first time. I can honestly say that this experience is worth every penny. I even paid for extended lessons so my son felt comfortable and confident behind the wheel. I am grateful for Katie and her amazing attitude. Highly recommend!!!<//text><Name>Amy Oh< /Name></record>

<text>I loved driving around with my instructor, Katie. She always arrived at my house on time and she gave me a lot of pointers that helped me during my drive test. Their online courses are pretty great too. I was able to gain a lot of knowledge of rules on the road along with passing my permit test on the first try. Everything went smoothly and I would definitely recommend this school!</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Well I passed the driving test. So it looks like they taught me something.
I survived the lessons. They did too. Can't do better than that.
The instructors I had were good. Punctual and good teachers.
As I said we all lived to see me pass. So yes this is a good school to be sure.< /Review></record>

Great place to learn to drive! It's convenient and flexible for your schedule and they take care of almost everything. I passed my driving test on my first attempt which was way easier than I thought it would be because my instructor taught me thoroughly and was calm even when I wasn't. My instructor was Eric, so if you're nervous about driving I recommend him!</text>

I will just copy my review on Yelp.

My coach Tony Tran is very nice and efficient in teaching. He showed me the route and necessary techniques, and also a mock test.

At first, I had a three-class appointment with Tony, and because his schedule was quite tight, I had to find another coach from another driving school. That coach just kept telling me that I am not good enough and asked me to practice a lot of meaningless task, like driving the previous student home, and go to pick up his next student.....(Can you believe that? it would take almost 1 hour from my 2 hours session). He made me nervous about my skill, and I was such a fool that I took 5 classes with him. He just would not stop and made me spend more money...

After finding my confidence in driving was nearly lost, I decided to find Tony again. He encouraged me a lot and helped me pick up my confidence again. I am going to take the test next week. Even though I do not know the result, I just want to say that driving should be something fun. Maybe I cannot pass the test once, but I know I will pass the test someday. A coach should always focus on the new driver's skill and feeling, not his wallet...< /review>

Wow, what a wonderful school.  My son got his driver's  license on the first try. I am so impressed with Varsity that I recommend this school to every parent and teen.  Mark, the owner and one of the instructors, was incredible.  His caring, knowledge, patience, and know how was the key to my son's success.  On one occasion my son had an instructor named Andy, who also was fabulous.  My son had five 2hour lessons and it was worth it.  In addition, Varsity offers an instructional tutorial that I purchased and it was extremely helpful.  Love this school and the instructors.<//text>

I’m so proud that my son passed his behind the wheel test today and obtained his license.  I have to give a big Thank you to Varsity Driving Academy for all their helpful instruction.  The online class helped my son pass the written test his first time and his driving instructor George was an excellent asset to him passing the driving test.  My son has special needs and George was super patient, informative and always on time for his lessons.  I’m giving George and Varsity Driving Academy 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!!!<//Review>

After I took behind the wheel driving instructions at Varsity I realized how easy it is to drive safely. All credit goes to WALTER, who was very kind and supportive enough during the driving lessons. He makes you feel at ease and gives great tips on how to pass the driving test. He knows exactly what the examiner in the test looks for and trains us for it perfectly. I was amazed to know how easy it is to park in a tightly packed parking lot with the tips I learnt from Walter. I would highly recommend you guys out there to enroll at Varsity to learn good driving, and also ask for WALTER since he is the best guy to learn from.<//text>

Varsity Driving Academy helped me understand how to drive properly according to the traffic rules. This is something you'd definitely want to learn for your behind-the-wheel test. ;) Tip: Ask for Katie. I like her best because she's calm yet firm. :)</Text>

Varsity Driving Academy will get you where you need to be to pass your driving test. The instruction is great, and the office staff are friendly and helpful too. I had Walter as my instructor, and he was knowledgeable, patient, and fun. He'll make sure you have the tools to be a safe driver even if you're a complete beginner. The lessons are very thorough and effective- they'll definitely build you the skills and confidence you need on the road. If you're looking for a place to get prepared for your driving test, I highly recommend VDA!</Text>

<Review>We had a great experience with Varsity driving school. They have knowledgeable instructors. They are super flexible and accommodating with our busy teen schedule. My daughter learned driving so well in such short time I am amazed. She drives with confidence and Passed her driving test with one error when she could have had up to 15 errors. Mark the owner even stepped in when we had to get a last driving lesson we had not planned ahead of time. Abby at the front office is superb. Professional, accommodating, knowledgeable. I recommend Varsity to any concerned parent who wants their teen to learn safe driving. Thank you varsity for great work. My son will be coming soon.< /Review>< Resp>

Absolutely wonderful company to have your kids learn how to drive from.  I have had two boys go through this program within the last two years and can no speak more highly of them.  The instructors are professional, kind and understand how to assist young drivers so they feel less hesitant when they drive with you after the first lesson.  The second lesson just inforces that and by the third your child will be confident and they pass driving test with the most difficult tester on first go.  Thank you Varsity Academy its been a pleasure!  The three little will ones will be coming soon.<//Review>

Worst experience ever. The instructor made a racistic statement in a small talk while I’m driving and also yelled at me when I made a mistake even though he know I’m just a beginner, which put me in a panic. I knew that it may be the case only for the particular instructor who taught me at that time but still I would prefer not to recommend this school to my friends</review>

I used Varsity Driving Academy for my behind the wheel training and with their help I was able to pass my driving test on the first try. I was somewhat nervous at first to get in a car with people that I didn't know, whether it was their job or not. Though the instructors I had were friendly and successful at giving me the skills I needed to learn how to drive safely. I had James for the first two lessons, him being my favorite, and he was great at being easy to talk to and get along with while also being an instructor and helping me get through the nerves of driving on the street for the first time. For my last lesson I had Veronica, and she was as well friendly and helped to boost my confidence for the driving test I was going to have the next day. Overall, I would definitely recommend this business for anyone trying to learn how to drive safely and effectively.<//Text>

< review>
Having driven only in India where we drive on the left side of the road, I was rather nervous about driving in the U.S. However, my instructor from Varsity quickly put me at ease and helped me navigate the unfamiliar roads. He has helped me rewire my brain and unlearn some habits I had, and that is sometimes harder than just teaching somebody who has never driven before. I feel I learn something new and useful in each class, and feel more confident about my driving test.

They are also always on time and will accomodate you in their busy schedule whenever they can, which I appreciate.< /review>

I recommend Varsity Driving Academy. They not only teach you how to pass your test but also teach how to be a good defensive driver. With only 3 lessons, I know that I am 300% better at driving and being safe. They got me appointments in time for my license test and worked with me on the times and dates and even on my 1 month short notice. Instructors are great and teach you all you need to know.<//review>

<Review>Thanks to Walter, I passed my license test the first time and am now a confident and safe driver. Walter is a great teacher; he made me feel very comfortable behind the wheel and taught me everything I will need to know on the road.

I enrolled my 16 yr old in the summer session, as well as 3 additional driving sessions, with the Irvine Varsity Driving Academy. His instructor, Isaac Downey, was the best. He would update me after each session, and my son was instantly at ease, from his first driving session. Scheduling the sessions was an easy process, as well. I also received an email prior to each driving session, as a reminder. I am so happy I went with Varsity Driving Academy and the 6 total driving sessions made me, and my son, feel a lot better, about him getting his license and driving on his own. I would definitely recommend Varsity Driving Academy to anyone, esp. for the newly teen drivers. The whole experience of studying for his permit, to driving with a permit, to getting his license was a lot easier, for both me and my son, because of our experience with Varsity Driving Academy. This is my 1st teen driver and I will also be contacting Varsity Driving Academy in the future,  for my 2 younger kids, as well.</text>

<review>Today was my first behind the wheel driving lesson. I was probably the most nervous I had ever been in my life. My instructors name was Tony who I believe is fairly new since there are no other reviews of him. He was really good! He was really chill and cool and helped me relax when I was stressed out. He was really nice about everything and he makes you feel confident. He turns on the radio and talks to you a lot, which helps you not to be so tense. I definitely recommend him, but he only teaches on the weekend so get him then!<//review>< pictures>

(Katelyn) I just passed my behind-the-wheel driving test this morning, thanks to Walter from Varsity Driving Academy! I highly recommend going to Varsity, and definitely ask for Walter- all the instructors were great, but he really gave me some expert tips and helpful advice that made me a safer and more confident driver. He has a lot of experience and knowledge to offer, and he always shows up on time. He's also extremely knowledgeable of all the cities Varsity Driving Academy covers. I feel he went above and beyond just helping me to pass my test- and even my mom has learned a few new things from him that has helped her improve her skills! Once again I HIGHLY recommend you go to Varsity Driving Academy and request Walter!</review>

I took the Behind the Wheel lesson and it was a great experience. Although I started driving two month ago, I easily passed the test. The lessons that helped me were how to park, pullover, and make a U turn.<//review>

<review>so i need my hours for behind the wheel at Varsity Academy and at first i had Jon he was great but then he no longer worked at Varsity Driving Academy. So then i asked my friends who else was a good instructor to have, and they all said you have to go to Walter he is the best most relaxed guy there. So i went to Walter and my friends were right he was amazing and really relaxed to drive with! And when anybody asks me who they should have as in instructor at Varsity Academy i say Walter is honestly the best and a greatest teacher there!So if you are looking for an instructor at Varsity Academy go to Walter he will help you out so much and he is such a great guy and a excellent teacher to have!</review>< pictures>

<Text>My son took the on-line class one summer and then he took the 6 hour behind the wheel classes about 3 months later.  We had the same instructor each time they came to take my son out to practice driving. They arrived on time and took him to many different areas to practice. He passed both of  his tests, permit and driving test,  the first time!  We were very happy with Varsity Driving Academy!  They had a great deal going on too if you signed up for both of the classes at the same time.  Well worth the money and they were always ready to reply back to us through email and or on the phone.
Thank you so much!

My parents praise me on my great driving and that's all thanks to the academy and Mr. McKinney!

Truly beneficial and an excellent service provided by the instructor. Not only did my instructor provide a great way to understand my mistakes, but my instructor remained calm and friendly throughout my time scheduled. My instructor made sure my driving appointment was made as soon as possible as well as setting it up on a day that is convinient for me. My instructor also took me to the driving test and was there to help me through every step of the way until the actual test. When I took the driving test, I passed with 4 errors. Thank you to Varsity Driving Academy for all the help!<//text>

<text>Having chosen Varsity Driving Academy, i can't say enough for how great the lessons were.  Before you know it, they fly by faster than one would like them too, but I guess that's normal when you're having so much fun, haha.

Walter had been recommended to me, and it was a blast driving with him.  Pretty quickly into the lessons I was already driving through the busy areas of Orange County, but it wasn't worrisome at all, instead having the opposite effect of making me want to drive the freeway and busier areas of orange county as a norm. That being said, the phrase I will remember the most is "GAS IT!!!"

Almost every time those driving around us made us feel cautious, Walter's would say "Gas it!", which saved us quite a few times, on the freeway.  Being able to learn as fast and as well as I did was through Walter's approach to driving; having me accurately and quickly approach situations I would have originally felt worrisome about, but not now, haha.

My lessons with Walter ended up being the most fun I thought I could have learning to drive. I feel much more prepared for quick decisions on the road than I felt I would have garnered from driving lessons before.  Especially after taking some lessons doing stick shift, it seems as if my driving abilities have advanced to the next level, which makes me excited for when I get my own stick shift car.

I highly recommend varsity driving academy!

I passed my driver license test on the first try! With the help of Walter, I was able to not only gain confidence in myself as a driver, but also drive safely on the road. Walter is a phenomenal teacher and makes me feel completely comfortable while driving. He is very relaxed and gives good tips on driving. He prepares you extremely well so you will be ready when the test day arrives. I highly recommend Walter because he's honestly such a great, friendly instructor. He cracks jokes and carries on a conversation with you so you definitely won't have to worry about getting tensed up or worry about any awkward silences.

Good luck to anyone who is planning on taking their driver license test (: And remember, to choose Varsity Driving Academy because they have good prices and good instructors !</review>

<Review>Really good program. Easy program to manage; my son squeezed in a full on-line class, permit test at the DMV, and 2 hours of driving behind-the-wheel before he returns to boarding school next week. Will reconnect with Varsity Driving Academy when he is home over Thanksgiving and Winter break to take some more driving lessons. Excellent customer service, great instructors, and an organized program. Thanks for making everything so easy on the parent. The whole experience was really managed by my teen son once I paid the fee. Super convenient and I recommend them to anyone looking to get a teen on the road safely.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Text>I signed up for 6 hour refresher lessons after reading reviews on Yelp, with a constraint of all 6 hours within less than a week of time. The booking process was simple, efficient and fast and Katie, my instructor, was on time, everyday in front of my door.

As an instructor, Katie was neither aggressive, nor controlling but instructive while letting you learn from experience. On the first four hours, taught me how to handle traffic in freeway/ residential and business roads and on the last day, had mock drive tests that were crucial to understanding what was important for the tests. She also gave me key pointers on what to keep up and what to rectify and it helped me perform on the day of the test. On top of all this, she personally followed up to check how I did on the day of the test.

As an organization, I think they are effective and most importantly don't sell/market their own services but cater to the need of the student. The service they provide is worth it's weight in gold.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dcddb056dafeab:0x86dae8fdfafcc2f2</gmap_id>< user>

<Text>My daughter got her driver license today. I am happy! : )
She took 18 behind the wheel lessons from VDA because my wife and I wanted she can drive safe alone. As you know, there are so many aggressive drivers in Irvine now.
The instructors of VDA were kind and gave her good lessons. I think she has got a lot of useful informations about safe driving from them. Thank you all instructors with her!
My son also took behind the wheel lessons from VDA 3 years ago.
They used VDA's DMV package as well. It is easy and very convenient. If you are busy or your car is not appropriate for the DMV Test, I highly recommend it.
I think VDA is one of the best driving school in Orange County.

Thank you! VDA</Text>< Pictures>

<gmapID>0x80dcddb056dafeab:0x86dae8fdfafcc2f2<//gmapID><Text>Just had my first behind the wheel training lesson today with an instructor named Tony.
Although he may be one of the youngest driving teachers there, he's a very encouraging, calm, and patient teacher. He also made sure I didn't run into any curbs! At the beginning, we started out slow - in my neighborhood - then slowly through other residential areas and eased into driving through streets and intersections. It's not as hard as I thought it would be and Tony was really patient with my mistakes and never put me down. He also guided me through a mock test of what the DMV will test on. He made sure I was comfortable and tried to help my nervousness calm by playing music on low volume and sometimes started conversations so I'd be more relaxed and less stiff. By the end of the lesson I was calmer and more comfortable about driving. Thanks Tony!!</Text>< time>

She took 18 behind the wheel lessons from VDA because my wife and I wanted she can drive safe alone. As you know, there are so many aggressive drivers in Irvine now.
The instructors of VDA were kind and gave her good lessons. I think she has got a lot of useful informations about safe driving from them. Thank you all instructors with her!
My son also took behind the wheel lessons from VDA 3 years ago.
They used VDA's DMV package as well. It is easy and very convenient. If you are busy or your car is not appropriate for the DMV Test, I highly recommend it.
I think VDA is one of the best driving school in Orange County.

Thank you! VDA<//review>

<Review>I first started driving and with my luck I got Walter, to me he's a wonderful instructor. He thought me all the tricks to driving safely! My parents didn't think I was ready but Walter did, so I took his word and scheduled my appointment for my license test! I was so nervous yesterday (the day before the test), but Walter believed in me and told me I was going to pass. I took the behind the wheel test this morning and only missed 2 points! I believe that if close to a year ago (when I had my first behind the wheel), l didn't get Walter, I wouldn't have passed! Thank you Varsity Driving Academy and especially Walter!< /Review>< pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>The staff at VDA were very helpful in increasing my confidence in driving, special thanks to Walter. Before I began the lessons, I was always anxious about driving and just the thought of being behind the wheel made me fearful. Thankfully, Walter was a great help in reinforcing safe driving habits and I learned to grow confident in driving in about a month's time. I passed the driving test thanks to all the positive support and skillful instruction that Walter gave, thanks a lot!<//text>< Pics>

<text>I searched “top driving schools” and after skimming through the reviews and visiting several websites, I chose Varsity Driving Academy. They offer some competitive driving sessions. I chose the 10 hour (5, 2-hour sessions). The ten hours gave me enough practice to get ready for the dmv driving test.

Signing up online was quick and easy. They were also able to help me set up my schedule. Weekdays were only available since they reserve weekends for teen drivers.

My instructor was Chris Felix. He was professional, patient, friendly, and helpful. He guided me throughout the training on how to drive as a “defensive, safe driver.” I learned to put into practice everything I learned from the dmv handbook. I even learned how to properly handle and turn the steering wheel, how to properly use the brakes, and how to properly accelerate and decelerate.

Thanks!

I am so glad I chose Varsity Driving Academy! My instructor George was very kind and patient with me. He taught me how to drive safely and gave me some great tips and advice! I passed today at the Laguna Hills location, on my first try! Thank you George and VDA for all your help, I wouldn't have been able to pass without you guys!!

Oh did I mention how AWESOME their customer service is?! They are very helpful with setting up appointments and they try their best to work with your schedule!

I would definitely recommend this place!!<//Review>

<text>I've had such a great learning experience with Varsity Driving Academy. My first lesson was the first time I ever got behind the wheel and I was pretty terrified. But within two hours I could already handle the wheel comfortably with the help of my instructor. They give you not only general tips but also specific, personalized pointers on what you need to practice. They really do over-prepare you for the license test and even make the time to teach you U-turns, take you on the freeway, and other things that aren't on the test but are essential to real-life driving. After learning from VDA, I now have not only my license, but also great driving skills that make me feel safe and confident on the road. I would recommend the 6-hour training to anyone looking to learn driving quickly and easily. VDA instruction is of the highest quality!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dcddb056dafeab:0x86dae8fdfafcc2f2</Gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate>< time>

I gave one star because theres is no 0 stars allowed. Save your money and go somewhere else!!! First of all, the office never picks up I doubt a business is that busy to the point where I've called 3 times and no answer. Second of all, I had the worst experience with a driver instructor who was the rudest person I've ever encountered in my life. He began screaming at my mothers face and yelling acting like a crazy person. Are these the type of people this 'business' hires? I can not say this enough, there are better school please save your money. Am only continuing with this because I have already payed but I can not express how unprofessional and bad this 'business' is.</text>

<user_name>Salva A</user_name><Resp>None</Resp><Pics>None<//Pics><review>I scheduled all appointments at once, and it was easy to do so over the phone. Not too expensive, and they were on time every day. I took 3 2-hr courses, and had a different instructor every time, which turned out to be helpful because each one gave their individual input. All instructors were professional, kind, and very helpful. I could sense that they trusted my driving abilities and were always ready to help and correct me. They gave me constructive criticisms and praise when appropriate. The cars they brought were all decent: similar in style, ability to pump up seats & adjust mirrors etc. to my liking, and easy to use. On the first day, I practiced everything besides freeway driving. During the next two sessions, they took me [of course I drove] by the Laguna Hills DMV, and I got to drive through the drive test course a few times each day, which helped a lot!! They even kept score as I went, and gave me feedback during and after each drive through. My drive test was essentially identical to what I practiced with the instructors, and I passed effortlessly! I appreciated that each instructor also gave me a few minutes long break after the first hour. They ensured that I reached home exactly when my lesson was over. I felt safe driving with them, and didn't encounter any issues with the personnel or vehicles.
Walter was one of my favorite instructors, he gave me confidence in my abilities and made me far less hesitant to drive at the speed limit. On the last day I drove with the founder/owner of Varsity, and he was also very kind and informative. My mom immediately noticed a big improvement in my driving skills and confidence on the road. :)< /review>< Rate>

<review>I took both Driver's Ed as well as the behind-the-wheel training at VDA.  Tony, my behind-the-wheel instructor, was very upfront and an excellent teacher as he eased me through the fundamentals, eliminating any uncertainty or anxiety that I previously had.
Overall, it was a very informative and enlightening experience.<//review><user>107634395969773581617</user>< resp>

THANK YOU Mark McKinney & Varsity Driving Academy!  Great experience and I recommend you to everyone.  Mark's demeanor with the young drivers is calm, calm, calm which makes the whole experience positive.  Plus, your added service of scheduling the DMV test appt., taking my daughter to the test and allowing her to drive the car she learned on adds that much more value!< /text>

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I paid for my son's lessons and the instructor, Kyle Parsons, on the day of the first lesson text me saying he was sick and rescheduled. Then on the day of the 2nd lesson, he text me again to reschedule for 2 months later. When the day of the 2nd lesson came (after already rescheduling 2 months later) Kyle never showed.  No call, no text, nothing. I text him and called the academy. I got a text back from Kyle saying he had a family issue and no longer works for the company. I sent him a message back saying wow thanks for the heads up. His response was "There was a death in my family, don't ever text me again." Talking to the academy, they had a different story. They said Kyle just had a baby and didn't know when he would be back to finish the lessons.  Whatever the real issue was, Varsity Driving Academy should have contacted all of Kyle's students and made arrangements with other drivers. Horrible business practice and I would not recommend anyone using them for their lessons. Instead of getting me a new instructor they said I should just find another driving school. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE YOUR MONEY AND WASTE YOUR TIME!!!< /Review>

My experience with this driving school was absolutely positive: Karen McKinney and Lili Balint did everything to assist me and find the best time for my lessons. They also helped me to adjust the time of my driving lessons when it was necessary. They also sorted everything out with my DMV appointment for the driving test seamlessly and quickly.

Special credit goes to Richard whose friendly and professional attitude helped me to build up my driving skills in a relatively short period of time, including motorway driving, effective observation and safe driving techniques. He also stimulated my self confidence so I am not afraid of driving in unknown areas and keep calm in difficult day to day road situations. Richard also has a good reputation of polite and easy going guy.

Wishing all the best to you guys, will definitely recommend you in the future. Olesya.</text>

<time>1455485223909<//time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>I work a lot of hours and had to find a school that could teach my daughter how to drive and take her out enough to really learn how to negotiate Orange County roads.  So I signed her up for the Varsity Driving Academy their 20+ hour behind-the-wheel package.  They took her driving booth in the daytime and at night, which gave her the confidence and experience to pass the DMV driving test the first time.

Additionally, the office staff is very helpful.  We especially liked Ms. Katie Korona, who helped us pick the right package to meet our needs.  She also coordinated a driving schedule that worked extremely well with my daughters’ availability.  Her customer services skills are exceptional.

Our favorite instructor “George” has nerves of steel, and nothing fazes him.  I personally could not handle the experience of having my daughter behind the wheel.  She was not very good at first.  After a few classes with him, she improved immensely.  George is very good at pointing out why one needs to follow certain driving rules on the freeway versus streets.  This is really important because explaining the reasoning behind certain rules of the road (DMV) helps a student remember it when it comes time to drive and to take the DMV driving test.  His straightforward manner really helped my daughter improve her driving skills.   With all the accidents I witness every day driving home in traffic, I am so grateful to George and the other instructors for giving my daughter the driving skills to hopefully avoid being in an accident.  They took her onto the 22 freeway, the 55 freeway (which is known for its daily quota of accidents) and the 405 freeway several times so she would have the skills necessary to drive on them.  My daughter got her license but wanted a few extra lessons on dealing with nighttime traffic on the freeway, so I signed her up for 6 more hours.  This has been an excellent investment.  The night time driving teachers are also great and since most of them are at the high traffic hours, my daughter got the skills and confidence to help her feel better about driving in traffic.

As for the cars, they are each a  bit different in size, which is great.  My daughter learned about the differences between the vehicles and how they can affect how she changes lanes (in heavy traffic) and the different blind spots.  Varsity Driving Academy really took the time out to plan an excellent driving sessions for my daughter to help her learn the skills she needed to drive in Orange County.  I would recommend this program to any parent who is nervous about their child driving in Orange County or who want the best possible instructors for their child.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

If you're looking for a driver's ed class, then look no further. After just finishing the four day in-class program, I do not have a single doubt about their high quality way of teaching you to be a safe driver. VDA excels in helping you master the basics of operating a motor vehicle, and they do this by the sample assessments that you take in abundance, the videos they show you in class, and the very informative teacher that helps you throughout.

The first taste I got of VDA was when I called to set myself up to join the in-class program. I spoke on the phone with Caitlin, who made my sign-up was really easy. She was very friendly on the phone, and I was surprised by how smooth the sign-up process went.
This helped jump start my excitement to be at VDA.

Katie was my teacher and will be my driving instructor when I pass the written test. Katie answered all the questions I had, at the highest degree of knowledge. She was very friendly and very approachable, and you are able to ask her any kind of question, no matter how stupid you may think the question is. Katie is, without a doubt, the greatest teacher you will find.

And for Mark, the owner, was no stranger to the friendliness that engulfs you as you start to be involved with VDA. His demeanor was very impressive. You'd expect that the owner would tend to other more important duties, but Mark was there because he wanted to be, and that was very easy to sense. He would contribute a lot to the discussions we had in class and he was a very easy person to speak to. Mark had a great presence, and it was also great to hear what he had to say. He always had something useful to say, and just his general attitude was great.

As a whole, VDA's environment was very friendly. Oftentimes, the driving instructors would pass through and they all added to the friendly environment. You could easily tell that the people were there because they wanted to be there. They are strategically located next to a shopping center, so you could eat out during lunch time. That's if they don't fill you up with the box of chocolates that they pass around. VDA is an elite driver's education establishment, and there is no place like it.

To conclude, I do not usually make an effort to write a review for a place. However, I made an exception today. The reason I made that exception, is that VDA is exceptional.

No, but seriously. VDA.<//Text>

<review>Hi guys! I just had my 2nd lesson today with John, but I haven't had a lesson since last September and didn't get to practice at all, so I was pretty embarrassed to have the lesson again so late. However, everything went smoother than I expected! John helped me warm up by letting me practice left turns, right turns, and u-turns around the neighborhood until he told me to go out on the streets. I drove around Irvine and Tustin, and even passed by my parents' workplace! Not only that, but John also thought I was able to handle the freeway, which I went on today for the first time! Lots of traffic, but a real and great experience even though there was an accident on the freeway since an enormous truck flipped itself by driving around a curve too fast LOL But yeah, John is a great instructor and really experienced. He understood me well and why I mess up (because I get nervous or I panic), but it helped that he was calm, and helped me stay calm by talking to me throughout the whole lesson. He told me that I did much better than my previous lesson even though it was so long ago. Whoot! Can't wait until the next lesson, thanks John!</review>< gmap_id>
