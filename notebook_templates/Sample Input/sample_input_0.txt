< review>
For starters: the food here is mediocre at best. The portions are small and the food is under-seasoned.  I had only planned on eating here because my friends like their hummus. The main issue is that unfortunately, our (registered) service dog was discriminated against.  After waiting 30 minutes past our reservation, we were rudely informed that our table had been given away to another party because our dog was not allowed on the patio. This is a trained, well-behaved dog that provides necessary medical assistance to my friend. The dark-haired hostess was entirely unapologetic to the entire situation until I threatened to write a review. I will be filing an ADA complaint.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>All the yes. Food, ambience, service, layout, location -- loved it. So glad this place was recommended!

We went with a party of 9 and sat in the patio. Even on a cold night we were fine with the heat lamps. All of the food was shared and, believe it or not, it worked. Everyone had more than enough to eat and the bill was very reasonable. Even with two bottle and some individual drinks, it was only $60/each.

The whole experience was a treat, and how delicious the food was only made it more true. I'd say bring more friends just so you can try all the plates!! Def going back to try their brunch menu.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn2zRntiN-hdvtlMHpDIHTdRhJSyx_GY6vfyyl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ0hQhJmPBudsP41kGwrX93BD0WlH6-KO1eMpk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

<Text>The Bowery is such a gastronomic delight! The chef is Middle Eastern and obviously dedicated to his craft of serving an interesting very large array of dishes. The shishkatori kebabs melt in your mouth, the beef tongue and comforting gnocchi are like a warm blanket. The harissa potatoes are tangy spicy and heavenly. And the pot au creme with halwa shavings  is foreign and exotic in the best sense of the word. Everyone should sample this delicious restaurant at least once a week.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Time>1597442232462< /Time><Review>I hadn't been to Bowery Bungalow before, and a good friend ordered food for a date. When I arrived, I found the environment to be quaint, personable, and the food was delivered to me Outdoors. Very safe! When I arrived at my friend's apartment, she laid the dishes out to be shared between us.  The smells and textures were very interesting, not your common fare. Each dish had its own very unique appeal. The uniqueness of the salad, the vegetable dish and the extraordinarily prepared ribs were unlike anything I had previously had experienced. Bowery Bungalow's unique take on Mediterranean Cuisine was a welcome and unexpected surprise. Of course I was tasting it through the senses of my extraordinary company, so it was hard not to love it! I will be back!!!!< /Review></record>

This place is one of my favorites in the area! Family owned and the owners are the sweetest people. The owner remembered my name three weeks after the first time I went- they really care about their customers! The baklava was to die for and the spicy lamb wrap was beyond tasty and fairly priced. I'm always going to be a regular here.</Review>

What a gem.  Both the food and service are top notch.  The baba ganoush was the perfect appetizer.  We loved the smoky pita bread that came with it!  I recommend the fried cauliflower, even if you don’t love cauliflower: crispy and tender with a lovely tahini sauce on top.  The ribs are flavorful and fall off the bone.  The tumeric fried rice was nutty, buttery and delicious.  I’ll definitely order the beef tenderloin kebab again.  They recommend 2-3 dishes per person but we ordered 5 dishes between the three of us and had leftovers.  There’s a beautiful patio out back which will be great for warm nights.

To avoid a painful parking situation, make a reservation for 6pm (opening time).  There were many spaces directly in front of the restaurant on Santa Monica Blvd.</Text>

<Review>Wanted to find a cute restaurant with unique cuisine while I was in LA. This place was everything I could have asked for and more. The atmosphere was incredible. The food was more amazing than words can describe. I've never experienced anything like this. "Unique cuisine" was an understatement!!! It wasn't so strange that my family and I couldn't eat. We're all picky eaters but the food was a perfect way to introduce interesting flavors. And the service was beyond amazing. Our waitress not only was extremely amiable and helpful, but was engaging and made the experience all that much better. I want to come back just to eat here again!!!<//Review>< pics>

With that being said, we do take out often. Most of the time a take out meal is decent. You don't get the full experience of dining in - and therefore your meal can be satisfying, but not amazingggg. Well, with Shaherzad our to-go order was still as delicious as dine in!! I was so pleasantly surprised. We ordered the salmon kabob, well done which was divine. So juicy and tender. The salad that came with the meal had a delicious dill flavored dressing.... so good. Really enjoyed our meal! Can't wait to come back!!< /Review>< pictures>

By far the most amazing, cozy hangout place that I would love to keep coming back near Los Feliz. The food is great with plenty of vegetarian options to choose from. Specially picked North African fare that you would not find at your regular Mediterranean restaurant.

I have been here countless times and I have to say that on every single visit, every single person who served us was charming and made the visit a little bit more special with their wits.

My favorite thing : Ask to be seated on the outdoor patio to the back of restaurant. It is simply gorgeous but expect it to be busy !!!</text>

The spicy potato is Bad. The Branzino is from a Pond, so it does not have  good flavour for all, for all u know if I had not seen the whole fish , I could have mistaken it for Tilapia.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Wow. Very very pleasantly surprised by gem in silver lake. Highly recommend the Mediterranean breakfast for two and my girlfriend loved the middle eastern coffee. Also, this restaurant has one of the best interior designs I've ever seen in LA- an eclectic, brilliant piece of interior design work. Notice the details.

< Review>
On the night that I went, the performances were good, but not great. I really enjoyed seeing Pixie dance, but the other two performances were just ok. The food was also just ok, but a little bland. I had to ask for some salt to try to get a little more flavor on my lamb. I think Berber is such a great concept, but there's a lot of room for improvement.< /Review>

The cauliflower appetiser was fantastic, but both our main dishes were absolutely tasteless!! So disappointing...

I order the “Cast Iron Mideast Chicken, Grandma’s Rice w/ Dried Fruit, Cinnamon & Almonds” and my friend the lamb.
We don’t understand how a dish with so many spices and seasoning didn’t taste of anything... truly impressive. When we told our waiter that the food was tasteless he said “I’m surprised” and that’s it 🤦🏻‍♀️

Ambience wise, the place is cute with a low-key/chilled atmosphere.</review>

A nice choice for having Lebanese and Mediterranean foods within a nice environment. People love this restaurant because of it's amazing spices and drinks. Some of their popular dishes are Babaganoush, Baby Back Ribs, Beef Tongue Shawarma.< /Text>

<Review>Definitely worth the wait! This place surprised me because all of the rolls were delicious! They are the best that I've ever had. Great price for the quality! They nailed the sushi rice --it tastes great and there is a thinner layer of it. Also, there isn't too much extra sauce on top of it to mask the taste of the fish. For two people, we got three rolls: Oban, John Collins, and Minna. I highly recommend all of them. Perfection!<//Review>< rate>

<Text>Lovely atmosphere, exceptional service, and delicious food. I ordered the beef shawarma plate, which was very rich, had a comfortable portion, and had a warm, savory flavor that lingered appropriately. The texture and flavors of the beef tongue, gnocci, and sauce combine together fabulously. I'm excited to come back and try more.<//Text>< time>

middle eastern food, super tasty. One of the best spots of its kind in the area. Really nothing but great experiences here, so I will be back. Bring your hunger - portions are generous. Menu is similar to a restaurant in Jacksonville I liked.</Text>

If you are craving for amazing medditarrian food and romantic environment, Bowery Bungalow is your choice. Their lamb sandwich is top-notch,  highly recommended to have it with Malbec.<//Text>

So delicious!! We ordered 4 things to share and they were all amazing. Probably the best food I’ve had in LA so far! Cute place, and the staff was great. Loved it :)</text>

<review>What a gem! It's been on my to-do list for a year and a half and I can't believe I've been missing out for so long. If you can sit out on the back patio, do it. It's a perfect date night spot.

They start you off with a tiny spiced lentil soup just to get you going. With that three sip soup alone, I knew we were in for a treat.

The portions are incredibly generous. The mains are easily split in two and the prices are bananas for the amount you're getting compared to similar spots. The slow roasted lamb is a treat. Get if you go. But honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with the menu.

And to add to the incredible treat that was the food, the service was fantastic to boot.</review>< response>

Really great food and well-sized portions. We assumed by their description of the dish sizes that it would be "tapas" style, which would've been disappointing at those prices but we were pleasantly surprised by how much food we got. Three dishes were perfect for two people. The food itself was absolutely fantastic as well. Warmly recommended.<//Review>

I was looking for Moroccan food when I was lucky to fund the Bowery Bungalow. When I took on the scent of the skillet chicken I quickly recognized a Moroccan chicken tagine and the taste was just what I wanted. This is a deconstructed chicken tagine! I recommend.<//Review>

If you want to talk about good talk about that Bowery Bungalow. The sauce is amazing. The traditional dishes are to die for. I love this place. I honestly visit about twice a week. (I work in the area, don't judge me). But even if I did it I would commute just for their food.< /review>

<Review>We enjoyed our date night at Bowery Bungalow! I made a reservation for Saturday evening a week or so in advance. We were seated outside, right by the heater (which I appreciated) - it ended up being warmer overall than inside most other restaurants.

* Babaghanoush: Perfect!! This came with shishito peppers, which I didn't think I'd enjoy but ended up being the perfect smoky complement to the dish.
* Beet salad: The combo of feta and beets is fatal to me. SO GOOD.
* Baby back ribs: Never had ribs like this before. They use a turkish coffee rub(???). This was a lot of meat.
* Beef tongue shwarma gnocchi: AAAAAA I can't compliment this one enough. The gnocchi are absolutely beautiful. Texture is just right. I tried to have some self-control and not scarf the food down, while still trying to eat it fast enough so my boyfriend wouldn't finish everything. I'd order this dish just for myself next time.
* Kunafa: We ordered this for dessert. Didn't think we'd have much room for it, but we managed to finish it. Nice and light, not too sweet. Would get again.
* Sangria: I really loved the pomegranate sangria! Highly recommend.</Review>< Pictures>

<rate>5</rate><Review>As a Lebanese, my judgment of Lebanese restaurants is harsher than most. Bowery Bungalow passes the test in terms of authenticity and respect of traditional Lebanese cuisine. The eggplant salad is the only item that came to mind that could be improved upon, but the rest was exquisite and well portioned. Excellent decor, beautiful terrace, friendly staff - a well-rounded restaurant for a wonderful evening.< /Review>< Pictures>

The ambiance is great. It's a good date place. It is rather small inside and since I didn't make a reservation,  we ended up sitting at a small table near the bar in what was termed the lounge area. It was a bit awkward to eat due to the lack of space - drinks had to be on the window sill to just barely fit all of the food on the small table. Service was good.< /text>< pics>

<Review>I have been to BB many times in the last year and I like it a lot. The food is always great, the setting is very nice both inside and on the patio outside. Their staff is usually good (they have the look-alike of Natalie Portman and she's adorable!). Their chocolate mousse is to die for!

Only (small) downside is that they always seem to struggle to coordinate sending the dishes at the same time.  However I'm still giving it five stars, definitely one of my favorite place in LA 👍🏼</Review><response>None</response><Time>1503615976662< /Time>< pics>

Ambiance was on point and aside from the shakshuka tomato stew dish (I just don’t think i like this dish anywhere), the food never disappoints. I’ve been here ~5 times and will keep coming back. Highlights are: Lamb Gyro, beef cheek hummus, trout rillette, and beets.</review>

<rate>5</rate><review>Holy moly this place is amazing. The food is well-spiced and comforting, with just the right touch of California influence. When we dined here, we arrived right at opening, so the dining room still smelled like it had just been cleaned, which is a good sign! but not a good smell, so we opted to sit in the back patio, which is wonderful! It's lined with greenery and has relics of a time when people milled their own flour.The wine list is really fun--it has just the right number of glasses/bottles so you are not overwhelmed by a wine novella, and each offering sounds like something you would want to drink.

Portions are quite generous, so you can relive your meal with a leftovers lunch.<//review>< pictures>

The food here is ok but the rude, inhospitable main hostess left a bad taste in my mouth. The restaurant door was locked so we rang the bell. A woman poked her head our and just said, "Yes?" We said we had a reservation for 2 people to which she replied "We don't open until 6." We didn't know this and waited 8 minutes until they opened. Once they opened, the woman was quite friendly to the other 2 parties. One of those parties let her know we were there first but she proceeded to help them first. Then she turned to us and said hi. My fiance said hi and and after that, the woman just stared at us for 10 or 15 seconds like we were nuts; she didn't ask how many people or indoors or outdoors etc. like she did for others. Instead of making us feel welcome, she made us feel like we were a nuisance. Finally, my fiance said we had two people. She abrasively asked what the name for the reservation was (as if we needed one) and silently walked us to our table. I then heard her ask another table (after they were already seated), if they "happened to have a res, by chance." The first impression that someone in the customer service industry gives speaks volumes. I considered having my wedding rehearsal dinner here but am so glad I had the opportunity to experience the poor customer service of the main hostess. I wouldn't want my wedding guests to have the same experience so we will be going elsewhere and I will not be returning. The food doesn't inspire (go to Bavel instead!), so the only thing you'll be missing out on is a testy attitude.</Text>

Walking up to the Bowery Bungalow, you can instantly feel the warmth of home. The interior is charming and inviting with its shiplap walls and stylishly comfortable country cottage decor. The intimate patio has individual tables for privacy, but also has two long communal dinning tables. The staff was instantly warm, hospitable, and attentive without hovering. The Andalusian omelette with Spanish chorizo was mildly rich in flavors that went perfect together. A great dish for brunch where quality flavor is desired without sensory overload. The Spanish chorizo was a bit difficult to cut the way it was presented, however, the flavor more than made up for it. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the greens were a wonderful compliment to the dish. I can’t wait to return and experience a dish from their dinner menu. Well done Bowery Bungalow, and thank you for a delicious brunch.< /review>

This place is a hidden gem. Charming atmosphere inside and out, although the patio in the back is my favorite for a larger group. The staff is friendly and helpful and attentive, and the food is delicious! Flavors that inspire trips across the world! Spiced, seasoned and colorful with plenty of vegitarian options (curried cauli is awesome!) though everything meaty is tops!<//Review>

Visited after a long day at the Griffith observatory and was so surprised - best meal I've had in a long time! For cocktails, try a Sage Wisdom (created by GM Marie) - refreshing aperitif and great palate cleanser after the warm, rich spiced harissa potatoes (do not miss these!). Then, try the shishka spiced tenderloin- sharp garlic sauce goes well with what I think is a citrus/zatar rub. Delicious and tender, perfectly med rare. Have a glass of Far Niente pinot for a silky accompaniment to the subtly warm cardamom rice pudding with a hint of crisp tree fruit - grilled to produce a sugary, sandy mouthfeel against the creamy pudding. Cozy, intimate environment and excellent service from beginning to end, especially by Marie and bartender JP. One of the best parts: a complimentary vegan lentil soup that is equal parts preserved lemon and sumac - incredible. You can order a bowl for 5 dollars, though it's not on the menu. You will not be disappointed!</text>

Sat at a semi-weird low table next to the bar that seemed more like something you'd see in a cocktail lounge.

if you had a reason to remember the name of this place... then let it be because the food was /is nothing short of SPECTACULAR. the name and menu don't connect, at least for me, but so what. they started us with a little bowl of lentils, perfectly cooked with subtle flavor. and then we had the mezze plate to get our palate going, it had a piece of feta on it with some insanely interesting herb combination on top. followed by couscous that made my tastebuds sing. multiple layers of flavor and textures, the best being the grain itself was fluffy and moist. currents, figs and apples rounded out the mouth watering explosion. hummus and warm pita, you have to ask for as it's not on the menu. hummus is hummus right?, wrong. this is like no other hummus I have ever had. the tahini was almost flowery in flavor, again texture and flavor 5 star. the a red and golden beet salad with hazel nuts, wow!  finished with the baklava w/rose water honey and that will bring you back again and again. I love this place, lively crowd and great beer selection. dishes are meant to be shared, so go with lots of people so you can try many things. we were stuffed with just three main dishes.</text>

<Text>Dr. Banks always makes me feel welcome.  He answers all my questions that I ask and he takes good care of me.

Because I live in San Pedro, getting to appointments is easier to get transportation Locally.   I am more comfortable in a smaller atmosphere so for future appointments I will be transferring to that office.  I wish Dr Blanka still saw patients there because I would definitely continue under his
Care..

Sincerely,

<Review>If you like a doctor with the stereo typical "GOD COMPLEX" whose temper is off the charts & his bed-side manner is cruelty & pushy, then Dr Banka is your man. I never could tolerate mean doctors & he is the meanest I have ever met in my life. You will never even get a word in before he shuts you down.<//Review>< Time>

<Review>Dr. Banka conducted a chemical treadmill on me last year and conducted a cardiovascular evaluation for an upcoming spinal surgery.  He is one of the best cardiologists I have had, knowledgable, careful, concerned and very nice.  He was caring about my overall health and recommended an additional test necessary for future cardiac health which I will follow up on.</Review><Time>1594943328498<//Time>< Resp>

Dr Banka is a very patient Cardiologist who explains everything thoroughly. I've never had a bad experience with him and I would recommend him to anyone who needs a Cardiologist.< /review>

Im very pleased with my new Cardiologist , Dr Banka. My first time appointment by phone. Haven't met him personally but I felt like Im in good hands. He is very thorough going thru my medical records and feel very confident with him.
He was recommended by my primary Dr. Panteha Rezaeian.
Hope to meet him in person for my Ecco Cardiogram.< /review>

<Text>I had menudo & taco de camarones (shrimp taco). It's just average. I have had better and they didn't provide any oregano for the menudo. The shrimp taco was made with fried shrimp $2. It opens early & closes late, convenient for those live/work in dtla. Will try their birria next, since it seems to be their specialty. They take cash/visa/master.<//Text>< Pics>

I have been to both the Sherman oaks location and had to try out the Hollywood location too since I was in the area. It really hit the spot and satisfied my craving. I tried their new wrap with cheese, bomb! I love their fries and fried pickles too. My husband got the wings and those were great tasting too. The parking was a bit of walk but well worth it. The good thing is they are open late till 2am. Staff was friendly. There is a restroom inside for customers.</text>

This place is great, from the food to the people making it.  Delicious and fresh chicken, yummy sauce, and mild options for the kiddos too.  It's a family favorite with a little something for everyone. I definitely recommend The Margarita Chicken as your go-to spot for quick and tasty eats in LA!</text>

This place is AMAZING! Please eat here!

The two of us ate our fill for under $20. Bisteca Torta was fantastic, and the pancakes and bacon are amazing as well. The place was quiet and the staff was very welcoming. I would love to come back my next time in town!< /Review>

<text>Great place, great service, Amazing  food. I love the breakfast  burritos. Hash brown eggs bacon and cheese. So delicious I never wait to get home before I start digging  in to it. Price are the best . It's  a mystery why this place isn't  on la weekly top 10 spots to grab a late nite smack. Open 24hrs and expects  Cal fresh and all major credit cards.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Maybe it’s due to COVID, but this has been the worst food I’ve gotten in a while. Not one person finished their food. We ended up getting food from another place. Best part of the meal was the drink. Won’t be buying from here again.<//review>

I have been going to this restaurant for 15 years.  ♥️ This is a place that you can always expect quality.  What's fantastic about this place is that the cooks who work there have been working there for as long as I  can remember.  So they know me and are a part of my family.  They know what I like and how I like it. So many memories here! This is a place for Amazing Los Angeles cuisine.  This place has been there for 45+ years! Open 24/7 there's sure to be something that you like! And they make custom orders!
Don't judge a book by it's cover! It May not look like much but this place delivers a superior quality of food.
Also the place probably makes the best fried chicken in downtown.  😱😱😱 So Great!<//text>

<review>I've been here once and maybe I'll go again. Decent pizza. Pizza wasn't bad, just not really memorable. Now, the chicken wings were so good. The chicken wings were crispy, yummy and a good size. I seriously would come back just for the wings.< /review>< gmapID>

It was Saturday evening, a friend and I were out late and we hadn't yet eaten dinner, so we searched the area for anything open, and decided to go to Margarita's Place. The menu for late night has everything you could want for a late night snack! Coming from Texas, I have a love for real good Mexican-inspired food, and this was outstanding. Your orders are made fresh by their staff and they are fast! Limited seating on the sidewalk, which was not an issue since we were there so late. I am so happy to know they're open 24 hours, as a student who stays up very late studying, and will definitely be coming back here for late night meals with friends.<//Text>

<Text>I come here in the middle of the night I like the Diner style stool set up. No frills just a long counter and some stools . You can watch the cook make your food. Sometimes the place gets slammed and whoever it be that's on the grill doesn't lose their cool. I like the Al Pastor burrito at $8 it's a lil pricey but big, great tasting and filling. They offer a small variety of Mexican dishes. It gets 4 stars because of the of the size of the place other than that, it's one of my favorite places to grab a late night bite<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

They could ease up on the grease.. Greasy food. Other than that with out so much grease the food would be tasty. 😋. Not a lot of grease but a little.< /Review>

Didn't care for this place. Too many homeless people badgering you for money. The food was ok, but it looked filthy. Better off eating at a taco truck.< /Text>

Margarita's Place isn't a high class Mexican food joint, but it's not a rock bottom dive either; it's somewhere in-between. The people are friendly enough and the food is good. I recommend the mojado burrito.</Text>

Original Mexican food cooked fresh in front of you. The refreshments are cold perfect for a hot day and fresh juices too. Oh so good! The men are perfect gentlemen and courteous too. The place isn't elegant but you will return for more. Oh, they're open 24 hrs too!<//text>

open 24/7/365 and they take ebt. what's not to love?

the menu is giant and I'm not just talking about how much space it takes up on the walls. I'm trying to corral my thoughts and get a clear picture of what they offer so I can break it down and write it up but the only thing clear to me is the likelihood of a midnight burger run to the place.

yaasssss I'll see you there, then.</Text>

I eat there all the time. Carne asada burritos are everything my ex-boyfriend told me about it and ever since then I can't help but go there and grub. I get the carne asada burritos everything but hot sauce on the side with cheese. Omg. Bomb. The meat is well seasoned. Everything tastes fresh and the workers are pretty cool they are efficient.< /text>

Food is pretty good. The burritos are pretty hefty, and can be quite spicy but that's a good thing if you like spicy food. I like spicy food, but had I known about the hot sauce I wouldn't have had it put on especially at 3am. Place seems kinda sketchy at night cuz the homeless, druggies, and alcoholics tend to hang around the front while begging for money, but during the day it's not so bad.< /Text>

Food here is very yum.  Also: In 1987, U2 filmed the legendary video for "Where The Streets Have No Name" on top of this building, causing a panic from the city, who shut down filming. The band got through nearly the whole song. June 3, 2011< /Review>

I live in the area and would go there because they take EBT food. I witnessed them call another Black person a monkey in presence and mentioned it the next time I went back. The same guy who said those words dismissed me so I said I would never go back because they don't  see or treat their customers equally.</review>

< Review>
Been eating here for a decade at least. One thing that amuses me is the residents of new, gentrified DTLA who for some reason expect it to more than or different from what it is at face value. Hey, you're not in the Valley anymore, princess. It is what it is.</Review>

(Translated by Google) On March 27, 1987, U2 held a concert on the roof of the building of this flat building. It's a Mexican restaurant now, but at that time a liquor store.
DJ on the radio show, as urgent warning live beforehand, performed in a way as a flash mob now. Even if it was interrupted by police notice, the video was awarded the "Best Performance Music Video" of the Grammy.
From this moment, one of the monumental places of the sacred place that will gain great popularity even in the United States.

Em 27 de março de 1987, o U2 realizou um concerto no telhado do edifício deste edifício plano. É um restaurante mexicano agora, mas naquela época uma loja de bebidas.
DJ no programa de rádio, como aviso urgente ao vivo de antemão, realizado em uma forma como um flash mob agora. Mesmo que tenha sido interrompido pelo aviso da polícia, o vídeo foi premiado com o "Melhor Vídeo Musical de Performance" do Grammy.
A partir deste momento, um dos monumentales lugares do lugar sagrado que ganhará grande popularidade inclusive nos Estados Unidos.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The place where U2 held a rooftop concert on the roof of this one-story building on March 27, 1987. It's a Mexican restaurant now, but at that time it was a liquor store.
The DJ will urgently announce the live performance on a radio program in advance, which is similar to what is now called a flash mob. Despite being interrupted by police warnings, the video shot won the Grammy Award for "Best Performance Music Video."
From around this time, it is one of the sacred monumental places that will gain great popularity in the United States.

(Original)
1987年3月27日、U2が、この平屋の建物の屋上をステージにして、ルーフトップコンサートを開催した場所。今はメキシカンレストランだが、当時は酒屋。
ラジオ番組でDJが、事前にライブを緊急告知するなど、今でいうフラッシュモブのような形で実施。警察の警告で中断されるも、撮影されたビデオは、グラミー賞の「ベストパフォーマンスミュージックビデオ」を受賞した。
この頃から、アメリカ国内でも大きな人気を獲得することになる、聖地記念碑的な場所のひとつ。</review>

< Review>
Been coming here for a long time now, always have a great experience, and great conversation. Not to mention , your haircut will barely even need a glance at the end, because its always top notch, just the way you ask for it. I have never had a bad experience,and highly doubt I ever will,because you are treated like family the moment you walk in. As long as I live in Murrieta, this is the only place me or my son will get haircuts!< /Review>

This is my only spot for getting a haircut! They are absolutely amazing. I love this barber for so many reason but to name a few... best haircut, best customer service, and toys for the little ones to play with if you have children. This place is simply the best!!!</Review>

I went to Stew's yesterday afternoon for the first time and immediately loved the atmosphere. Great decorations , memorabilia, sports team posters and a lot of things Star Wars. They also have a little corner for your children to play in. I received a great haircut and shave from Kelly who took great care of me. She was awesome. I hope you feel better! Nathan, the owner, was very friendly, happy and professional. I had a great experience and will definitely be going back when I need another trim. Thank you guys!</text>

By Far the best hair cut I have received in my six years in this area. Nathan was absolutely incredible. I could not have asked for a better experience. Attention to detail was perfect and he knew exactly what to do given my eczema. Best Barber between Temecula and Murrieta for sure.< /text>

Don’t cut your hair with him.  This is the second time that has ever happened to me at this shop. I gave it a second chance. Unfortunately the owner is hardly there anymore. I used to be a client for years. A lot great barbers used to be there, I don’t know what happened but there’s seem to be a lot of turn around on people. Unfortunately I’m not going to go there anymore.</Text>< pictures>

I LOVE this barber shop! I don't go that often as I love long hair, but it is frowned on in this age in my life. I don't have a band any more and hair is thinning up top. I have many disabilities and if you want your hair cut your WAY, YOU MUST DEFINITELY COME HERE. YES, THERE IS MORE...THEY ARE WONDERFUL DOWN TO EARTH PROFESSIONALS. GO, AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN!

Best place anywhere to get your hair cut. All of the people who work there are awesome and it really has that old time barber shop feel. I personally have been going for 17+ years and its the only place I will go.</text>

I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience.  The staff are all very friendly, and Nathan, the owner, is clearly appreciative of every customer that walks in the door.  All of the staff are very competent, but my personal favorites are Nathan and Carmen, especially for fades.  Glad to support a local business that does it right.<//Review>

< Review>
I've been coming here for yrs. I now live in San Diego, but I still make the drive, because Nathan is just that good!
My son is a Marine. When he comes home, he always asks if he can get a skin fade from Nathan or one of the ladies. This from a guy who's required to get a haircut once a week. He says "Nathan's just the best at it."</Review>

Outstanding barbershop, this is the place for a good old fashioned quality haircut if your domepiece needs trimmed up. Kelly did an awesome job of making me look respectable again after riding through from Tennessee. Keep up the great work! #goPackgo<//text>

Don't go during lunch hour. They all apparently take lunch at the same time, which isn't posted anywhere, so you get to find it out after waiting for an hour or two in the sun.< /text>

I usually don’t share an experience with DMV but today I had a great experience with an employee at the Commercial Testing Center in Fresno. The gal that helped me was a complete pleasure to work with. I wish all DMV employees were as helpful and kind as she was! Thank you!<//review>

Went there and took my class A, my instructor was awesome! He made the test totally stress free.  Big open area for the skills test  was really nice. In and out in roughly 2 hours. I highly recommend this location for your CDL testing!!< /review>

The only good thing this place has going for it is that it's a nice office and the location near 2 trucking schools but the wait time is a JOKE every time I've been here I've had to wait for well over an hour(2 hours wait time on regular) and for anything even if you just come to take a test your going to have to wait, I don't know if it's because there understaffed or if the current staff just doest care. If you can avoid going here do so it's a waste of time for anyone coming here<//Review>

<text>With all the money that we have to pay in dmv fees why do people have to wait hours for a very simple transaction like a print out.  They have 2 windows open and a room full of people. Seems like dmv could figure out a way to speed things up...instead of slowing it down.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Wait times are incredible be ready to wait up to 4hrs before being called. If you are here for pre trip, skills, and on the road testing you  have already failed if you get Chris. That S.O.B. has a bad vibe saw one time he failed 5 people back to back mean while everyone else is passing with the other testers. I got a white lady and she was awsome and from what I herd the rest are awsome too. Just pray you dont get Chris that guy fails people its not you its him he needs to be reviewed on how he tests people.</text>

<Review>Call the BBB. This company is a total scam. Somehow they knew my SS number and asked me to fill in the last four digits. I didn't even finish my application and I was getting calls and email from a ton of mortgage cos.<//Review>< Pics>

I am always wary when such sites hint that they are going to show rates online, but all they do is share your details with God knows who! They took the phone number which I entered reluctantly, and shockingly, the next messages says, “get ready to get phone calls from lenders!” No warning, no approvals - at least none that was obvious. I am now gearing for a load of phone and email spam.

Avoid at all costs!

Update: I have received many calls. One lender called 4 times in the same day before I blocked them! Keep in mind that I never gave permission for these calls and all I was looking for was an online idea of rates before I even connected with them. As you can see, this experience has really irked me.</text>

< Review>
Would rate 0 stars if possible. Same experience as other reviewers. Totally bogus. After providing info, no lenders were provided. Site page says lenders will contact me - so great, now I suspect to have a bunch of unwanted solicitations and spam calls to look forward to.< /Review>

Pretend that they will provide rate estimates when you put in your info (luckily I skipped any questions with personal info I didn't care to share), at the end... no rate estimates, just put you on mailing list and spam call lists. SCAM<//review>

Terrible website - they request information for a loan and blast out to every lender.  In theory this is OK if the lenders are relevant - but all of the ones that got back to me didn't do jumbo loans, so why did LendGo send it to them?  Terrible company, don't waste your time.  I wish I had read all these reviews first.<//text>

I broke one of my primary rules; never do financial business in a rush! I fell for the "outright" lie and wasted time for a rate that was never going to be provided! I agree with others in this is a travesty that Google allows this deception to persist!< /Text>

Very scary. They are a scam. they ask all your information for a refinance rate including date of birth and last 4 digits on the social and then just disappear , no information not even an answer on what to do next.
They are scammers. I am afraid I gave them all my information believing I was talking with a bank. at the end I had a blank page. PLEASE MARK THEIR EVENTUAL EMAILS AS spam. Google SHOULD PROTECT US AND REMOVE THESE SCAMMERS, I did it ONLY because I have trusted Google.<//review>

Man this is a sad review to write since we are moving out of the area.  When I moved here in 2018 I was extremely apprehensive since I have had the same vet in Virginia since I adopted Sloan.  Dr.  Shinzaki and Dr.  Smith (even though he is a CSU grad us Wyoming fans won't hold that against him) were amazing to Sloan and to Star once we brought her in.  They always call and follow-up and I certainly missed going inside since the pandemic since everyone is welcoming.  Sloan just trots on in like she owns the place and Star has gotten better though still a terrorist.
I can't recommend this place enough and I hope they provide your babies with great care as they have mine.  The Foster Family is going to miss you.</review>

I came to Poway Animal Hospital on the recommendation of a friend when my vet was unable to see my dog during an emergency. Not only did PAH fit me in immediately, but everyone was so incredibly kind. The doctor, vet techs and staff were all communicative and kind. This type of service and dedication has me ready to switch over to be a full-time client of Poway Animal Hospital. Thank you!< /text>

<Text>I can't say enough about the outstanding and compassionate care that the veterinarians and staff provide at Poway Animal Hospital. We've been bringing our cats here since we moved to the area 9 years ago. Dr. Teague took outstanding care of our two seniors until they passed two years ago. Now we have two new Egyptian Mau youngsters and are getting the same great care from Dr. Smith as well. I recommend PAH to family and friends. My daughter takes her cats here now too.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6pZS4EKd-kKtnbT88HGrT6uREJnwwK9WVopp7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDDSinUSDAnS2LugNWVLOAwTu1vX4aIl_0Vl6d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

I highly recommend Poway Animal hospital for pet care!!!!  My husband and I have been going to Poway Animal hospital since 1996.  The doctors and entire staff are very helpful, friendly, extremely knowledgeable, absolutely great with your fur babies!!  Due to their care, our previous cat lived just under 19 years!!   Our new cat just turned 4 and has been in their care since day 1.</Review>

<Review>You could not improve anything with Poway Animal Hospital.  So considerate, responsive and professional.  Same staff and vet techs for 20 yrs. that tells you a lot. Always the best. Hands down
I recently adopted a pup. Thought she had a UTI, she had bladder stones and lots of them. With in 48 hours Poway Hospital had identified the bacteria, type of stone and had her in surgery to clear them.
They are the very best. I’ve used them for many tough cases including kidney failure, liver shut down, IBD, eye issues, ear infections etc.
They are professional, technical and ethical. I can not imagine going anywhere else.<//Review>< time>

<Text>I have been using Poway Animal Hospital (Dr. Smith) to care for my pets for the past 25 years.  Dr. Smith is so knowledgeable and caring and I wholeheartedly recommend him!  He has taken care of everything from routine care to surgeries to the difficult times I have had to say goodbye to a beloved pet.  There is no better veterinarian in San Diego in my opinion! The staff at Poway Animal Hospital is fantastic, as well.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>My pup is a new patient at Poway Animal Hospital and I'm beyond thrilled with the service we received!

I felt so well cared for, and I wasn't even the patient!  Even with the new COVID-19 protocols which prevented me from going inside, I felt kept in the loop through the entire visit.  I was given a breakdown of services and products that were recommended (but I never felt like I was being forced to purchase anything I didn't feel was necessary at the time) and I was able to take my time, ask questions, and make educated decisions.  My dog, Charli, received such stellar care as well.  I felt like she was in good hands with everyone in the practice, especially Ashley, who bonded with my dog, so much so that Charli laid in her lap at one point, and Dr. Kara Hazens, who was so thorough during AND after the exam.

I could not be happier that Charli's old vet couldn't get her in quickly and I was able to get her in here instead.  We have found a vet I - and my dog - LOVE!!!  Thank you, Poway Animal Hospital!<//review>< pics>

A big shout out to Dr Smith and the staff at Poway Animal Hospital. I was quite late for our pup’s appointment and they managed to squeeze her in that same afternoon. Thank you for your generous and professional advice. During the challenging COVID times, your office had the system streamlined to protect all of us. I highly recommend your practice to all who love their animals!<//Review>

The staff was really nice and informative. They kept me up to date and listened to my concerns while addressing them without dismissing me. The last point I'd like to make is probably the most important. They've not only changed their process with coronavirus but it's a process that works. Other animal hospitals will have you waiting around with a sick dog in your car for hours. I don't know how they do it, but their system works.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I called another vet earlier this month when one of my cats fell seriously ill. The receptionist stated that they were fully booked and could not see my kitty. I've never had that happen before - I've used that vet for 17 years! I did a quick Google search for vets in Poway (not a fan of the other 2 Ramona options) and ended up calling the Poway Animal Hospital (PAH) (powayah.com). That phone call was a complete 180, as the receptionist heard the worry and fear in my voice and said, "bring her in now, we're busy, but we've got you". I drove down there and they promptly took in my girl - I dropped her off due to the estimated wait time they gave me, and the Dr called me before I even got to CVS in town. The Dr clearly explained what he thought was going on AND took the time to answer all my questions (I had many). The next day, I received a call from PAH, following up with my visit - asking how my girl was. The following day, I received a beautiful card in the mail, thanking me for choosing PAH and wishing me & my girl all the best. Hands down the BEST veterinary experience I've ever had and PAH has made me a lifelong client. I'm so glad I chose PAH, as kitty would have died without treatment! I'm happy to report that kitty made a 100% recovery and all is well!</Review>< pics>

<review>I decided to go to Poway Animal Hospital after some traumatizing experiences at another vet.
I was drawn to PAH due to the location to my dog’s day care.
Upon first appointment I knew PAH and Dr. Tracy Smith were EXACTLY what we needed.
Dr Tracy Smith has a heart for pets and is one of the most compassionate soul’s I’ve ever met.
The staff is supportive, kind and knowledgeable.
The follow up after treatment is incredible (they will even text a photo).
The community of Poway and surrounding around are so fortunate to have PAH and Dr. Tracy Smith.
Thank you for all that you do!</review>< pictures>

<Review>The Vets & the rest of the staff at Poway Animal Hospital  have always provided the most personable,  knowledgeable, courteous & compassionate services to both myself & the other very important members of my family, my pets. I’ve been entrusting the care of my cats to them for the past 20 + years that I’ve lived in SD & will continue to do so as long as I live anywhere in the San Diego vicinity. I can’t sing their praises enough & would recommend Poway Animal Hospital  to any of my friends & acquaintances.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dbfa31f6d81d47:0xc32bc818589f4018</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

27 + yrs of excellence. We’ve had eight dogs, a couple of birds, a rabbit even a rat, cared for by the Drs’ and staff at Poway Animal Hospital. Drs’ Shinzaki and Smith have been so caring and compassionate during the sad times of losing a beloved pet. All the staff, techs are very knowledgeable, friendly and caring. You can’t go wrong bringing your pets here.</Text>

I originally went to Poway Animal Hospital due to a recommendation from another vet in Poway. That doctor sent me there because they were doing specialized procedures needed by my dog at that time. Years later, I have continued with the doctors and staff at the Poway Animal Hospital because of their skills, demeanor and apparent love for all animals and their owners.<//text>

I took my dog in for a small bump on her head that is likely a piece of thorn or bark, splinter, something. The vet spent five minutes with her (mostly me) and told me it would likely come out in another week or so. I was given an antibiotic. I was charged $106.00 for this. I am one VERY UNHAPPY customer. $106.00 for a five-minute visit and the vet did NOTHING. I do NOT recommend this place.< /text>

I have been going to this place for about 16 years and it has always been  accommodating and special to my dogs and me.  The staff is always friendly and very helpful at any time you might need to talk to them, either in person or on the phone.  The doctors are fantastic also.  Dr. Smith is my mini Aussie's, (Ozzie), doctor.  He's got an amazing way of making him feel comfortable, due to his, (Dr. Smith), calming nature.

They also have a great after hours system.

Thank you all at Poway Animal Hospital!< /review>

<Review>Brought my dog here for a second opinion.  Dr. Teague was very polite and attentive, and seemed to genuinely care about the well being of her patients.  After our visit, she had us speak to her again over the phone to follow up and get guidance on how to continue caring for our sick dog.  Would absolutely return to this hospital.</Review>< Time>

They are very knowledgable and do a great job in treating our dogs.  During this last visit when our dog, Pumpkin, was getting her teeth cleaned, they sent me a text and picture of Pumpkin after the procedure.  It was really neat and very special!

Thanks for the awesome care!<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
We have been with Dr Teague for roughly 14 1/2 years.We think she is a wonderful and and very caring Vet, and our yellow lab Casie.thinks so too!
We tried to switch Vets when she changed locations, but we then followed her to Poway! Our questions have always been answered to our complete satisfaction, and it would be hard to for us to feel as comfortable anywhere else after using her all these years!!!
We give her 10 Stars!!<//Review>

< Review>
My husband and I moved to Poway in 1999, and since then we have depended on Dr. Tracy Smith and his associates at Poway Animal Hospital for the care of all our pets.  I can not say enough good things about Tracy Smith; he is personable, professional and very caring.  He goes the extra mile in providing information and sharing in decision making, and he is empathetic and supportive.  Everyone on the staff is considerate and helpful, and I feel our beloved animals have received the best possible care at Poway Animal Hospital.  I wish they were licensed to treat human patients!</Review>

< review>
3 years ago I took my 3 year old golden retriever in for routine blood work for heart worm medication.  After telling them that our little boy wasn't keeping up on our runs like he used to, they immediately took him back in and found that his red blood cell count was down to 18.  Normal counts are above ( I believe ) high 30s - 50s.  They immediately sent him for a blood transfusion and then, through testing, found he had a very rare bone marrow disease and auto-immune disease.
They worked tirelessly calling every specialist in the country trying to find anyone that had had success in treating this.
Nothing seemed to be working and Tucker was scheduled to be put down.  Right before I was to bring my baby boy in, Dr. Smith called with one last hail Mary.
He had found someone that had some luck with a treatment and, after another transfusion and series of treatments, we had our boy back.
I was a long road and he is slowly coming off his auto-immune medications, but 3 years later we still have our beautiful Tucker with us.
His blood work is normal and he has an amazing dog life ahead of him.
I can't say enough about these wonderful people.  They treated Tucker like their own and did everything in their power to save him.
They will have my business for life!

I did a lot of research on local vets before choosing Poway Animal Hospital.  Their staff is very professional and sweet.  And all the doctors are amazing.  I feel like I get quality care for my 3 dogs.  I appreciate their passion for making sure we do what is best for my furry kids.  I have been through everything from puppy stuff to senior care and never had an issue.  I need to feel comfortable with the environment and people when it comes to my animals and trust them and I definitely feel that way with Poway Animal Hospital :)< /text>

<Review>I have been taking my chi mix Brian since he was a puppy. He is now 5 years old and we have always been treated amazingly. I have a new fur baby, Jojo, who is also a patient. Every time we visit we are warmly greeted, we have never had to wait long, and the front office staff is super helpful. We mostly see Dr Smith, who is very kind and patient. I love that they send me reminders of when vaccines are due and they call to follow up whenever one of them is sick to check on them.< /Review>< Pictures>

We took our dog to the Poway Animal Hospital for his entire 14 years. He always received skilled, compassionate care that is around the going rate for services. They helped get him through many medical issues over the years. When he had surgeries, the fee was always towards the low end of the range they expected to charge. He was always cared for like he was part of their family. Next time we get a pet we would not hesitate to go there again!< /Text>

We have been taking our two dogs to Poway Animal Hospital for a year now. We decided to switch because our old veterinarian was VERY expensive. At Poway Animal we have the exact same level of care (actually it's even better!) but without the steep charges. They are so reasonable and every staff member is so helpful and kind. We've seen all of the Veterinarians in the office and they are all our favorites! I highly recommend Poway Animal Hospital for Veterinary Care!!< /Text>

<review>We've been taking our cats to Poway Animal Hospital for about 19 years and have always had an excellent experience.  We've primarily used Dr. Smith and Dr. Shinzaki but I would trust any vet in their practice.  They offer the latest and best in veterinary care, and if a specialist is required, they'll send you to someone they trust.  But they are also very sensitive to budgets, and will always tell you recommendations from the simplest/least cost to the more complex/expensive options. We've gone "from cradle to grave" with some of our cats  with them, and I can't imagine a more caring or compassionate bunch of people, including both doctors and staff. Shout out to staff member Chris at the desk, who has been there for many years and is consistently helpful and thoughtful.  I give this practice my highest recommendation!< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Through the years our 4 dogs have gone to Poway Animal Hospital. When our first two dogs were young we made the transition because of the cost for basic needs and no huge pressures of nickel and dimming us. We were referred to Dr. Shinzaki who was so very professional and gentle with our dogs. Losing a pet is devastating (two amazing dogs through the years) and the Doctor staff are so attentive and caring walking you through the process. Dr Shinzaki has been wonderful with our dogs and we appreciate the loving, professional staff at Poway Animal Hospital.< /Review>

<Review>We have 2 Akita Pups.  We have been with Dr. Shinzaki for almost 2 years now.  He is so great with our pups.  His knowledge is quite amazing.  When we took our pups to him, you can tell that how much he care for them.  Dr. Smith is same way.  Their rate is very reasonable and sometimes they don't charge full amount. The staffs are very nice to them, Brutus (Male Pup) loves to put his face on the counter to get attention.  Doesn't matter that taking us more than 1/2 hour to get to this Vet office, we prefer to travel to bring our pups here.</Review>< user_name>

<review>I adore Poway Animal Hospital.  I have been going there for over 13 years (with my first dog and now with our new puppy).  The level of service is beyond outstanding.  When we found out that our first dog had cancer, the vets at Poway Animal Hospital did everything they could and were able to save our beloved family pet.  Years later, when the inevitable had to happen, the physicians and staff at Poway Animal Hospital was extremely compassionate and caring in our time of sorrow.  Now we have a new puppy and were very excited to return to our excellent vets!  I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Poway Animal Hospital - I do not believe I could find better care for may animals anywhere!<//review>< pics>

I have every confidence in Dr Shinzaki & Dr Smith when they treat our 2 dogs and cat. The office staff, and sometimes even one of the Drs, call the day after a procedure to check on the pet's recovery.

Poway Animal Hospital is the best.  The primary vets--Patty Teague, Tracy Smith, George Shinsaki--and all of the staff consistently provide loving, up-to-date, and thoughtful care.  They consider the whole animal and what is best for him/her.  I have trusted 5 beloved dogs to their care and I have never been disappointed.  If you are looking for veterinary care that you can trust and people who will love your animals almost as much as you do, you need look no further!<//Review>

I am currently online looking for a new vet and got excited when I saw a vet with so many reviews and 5 stars. To my dismay this is the vet that I am leaving.

Why am I leaving?
• Unknowledgable staff who take the easiest way for them not the best way for my dog. I had a 12 year old golden retriever with a tumor near his paw and they wanted to take his whole leg off! We got him in with another vet who was able to give him doggie chemo and remove just the tumor, leaving him foot in tact. Who the f tries to take a dog's leg off without exploring other options? Especially when it's a perfectly healthy 12 year old who's quality of life would've been lost.
• Rude / insensitive staff. I have had the misfortune of bringing my two 14 year old boys in because it was their time. The first time I brought my border collie in the lady did nothing but harass my mother and I who were being made sick over this time coming for months. We took our dog with us and to an emergency vet who would let our family peacefully lay our baby to rest. The second time I brought in my 14 year old golden (same dog as the 12 year old prior) and was assured the wicked witch of the vet would be gone. I shouldn't be surprised but this experience was no better. It was emotionless, money-oriented, and disgusting. There was no apology, no love, just a cold needle and our being forced to step over our dead dogs body to leave.
• Money-driven: Everything is money first, my pet second.

So I am happily leaving. And if you are searching for a vet online like I am, don't be fooled. I have yet to meet a staff member who cares about my dogs or delivers professional service. I should've left day one.< /text>

<review>Dr. Tracy Smith has been our vet for almost 15 years. The level of service has always been outstanding. When we found out that our first dog had cancer, we were devastated but Poway Animal Hospital and Dr. Smith specifically talked us through the process and did everything they could to keep our beloved Raven comfortable until the inevitable day came. Dr. Smtih and staff were extremely compassionate and caring during this very difficult time.  We recently adopted our new family member and have returned to Poway Animal Hospital. We are happy to be back and am very confident we will continue to receive the great care we were use to for so many year. I  HIGHLY recommend Poway Animal Hospital.</review>< date>

Dr. Tegue went right to work examining, testing and diagnosing our dog very quickly.  She got us an appointment with a specialist right away.  She has checked up on Graeme by calling us and also keeping in touch with the specialist.
Dr. Smith, Dr. Shinzaki, Dr. Teague and their staff have been caring for our cats and dogs for the past 16 years, through the good and the sad.  I highly recommend them as very competent and caring vets!< /text>

We have been going to Poway Animal Hospital for over 20 years. Dr. Shinzaki is so caring and wonderful. We've had to walk a few of our furbabies over Rainbow Bridge and they were always caring and understanding. Keeping our other furkids happy and healthy is their first goal and we can always depend on them to do the best for them.<//Text>

<Text>I have been taking my cats to Poway Animal Hospital since 1993.  The front staff is courteous and caring, when I have questioned a bill, found a cheaper alternative that was still effective.  Drs' Smith, Shinzaki and Metcalf have always been patient with my 101 questions, compassionate when I've had to make hard decisions, and holding my hand (literally) through the process.  My current kitty will be 17 in March and she thinks she's 3, in my mind due to the excellent care received over the years from these vets.<//Text><rate>5<//rate>< GmapID>

For more than ten years we have taken our five "puppies" to Dr. Teague, Dr. Smith and Dr. Shinzaki with each doctor having gotten us through one or more crisis(es?) From spinal surgeries, epilepsy, lump removals, lump biopsies, serious eye conditions, allergies and allergic reactions, and pin cushion eating to just plain ole comfort and care giving -- yes, for the human too. They and their team have been there for us all the way.  They are very thorough with the examinations and don't hesitate to refer you to specialists when warranted. And between them all there is a lot of expertise shared. I can't say enough good things about the care we and our pups have received.  And, not necessarily related, be sure to buy pet insurance so that you'll never find yourself in a position of not being able to afford to give your pet the best of care.<//text>

<Text>Dr. Smith, Dr. Teague, and Dr. Shinzaki are great with cats and our kitties are always well treated at Poway Animal Hospital. We've gone through everything from ringworm to behavioral issues to cancer with our cats and the PAH team, and Dr. Smith in particular was the soul of compassion as he counseled us through our sweet BB's passing last year. There are no nicer or more practical veterinarians--they have never tried to upsell us on treatments that would be good for their bank account but unpleasant, unnecessary, or ineffective for our babies.

I've known both Dr. Smith and Dr. Teague for over 20 years--they both treated the first dog I owned in Poway. Ziggy, my yellow lab, lived happily over 16 years. He had an annual exam and both Dr. Teague and Dr. Smith performed surgeries on him.
The care was always excellent and I always received a follow up call to make sure his recovery was going well.

Just last year, both doctors (and Dr. Shintaki) helped me through the cancer and end of life of my beloved Vizsla (14 years old and cared for by Poway Animal Hospital). I cannot imagine a more caring office. I continue to take my younger Vizsla, age 6, to their office. They are the best!</review>

I have been going to Poway Animal hospital for 14 years. Both of my golden retrievers have been patients of Dr Shinzaki and I couldn't be happier.  My dogs make a scene each time they see him!  I have been through various different medical issues with my two dogs (ear infections, worms, digestive issues, eye infections, pancreatitis, fox tail lodged deep in an ear, spaying and the dreaded hip dysplasia @ 8 months) . We also experienced the loss of our first dog.  Throughout every issue, we have experienced top notch care, concern and compassion.  The staff is also ready to help with any questions and concerns. They are also always ready to squeeze me in to see my doctor. Great Place! I highly recommend it.< /Review>

I have a pair of roller skates actually two(2) pairs of roller skates i had brought those skates into chito's shoe repair both of those skates needed boot work done on them i went in their to pick them up i was very pleased to see the end result of the work they did on them. my indoor skates needed some work done on them the boot needed a mild repair i thought they did a good job on my indoor skates i brought them back in for them to re-do what they did and they did not charge me they were very courteous and even did a much better job then what they did at the beginning. these guys are highly recommendable. I would never go anywhere else!!<//Review>

Chito’s has repaired numerous pairs and shoes and random leather goods for me. They always do a great job for a reasonable price and they are super friendly. Highly recommended!<//review>

< Review>
Super friendly, helpful, and honest people working here. I got my boot repaired for $2 in 5 minutes. Granted it was a small fix, but I appreciated the great customer service. I will be back soon with another pair of shoes to repair. In this age of waste and consumerism, it's nice to repair and use your stuff for longer instead of just buying new over and over.<//Review>

What a great shop! It has that wonderful old time feel and smell. The gentlemen behind the counter could not have been more kind and knowledgeable. They took one look at the running shoe that I brought in and within  minutes of a few drops of well placed glue I was on my way. Best of all they refused to let me pay anything. They are amazing in every way possible!<//Text>

Victor is the man!  Always does a great job on whatever we need repaired!  Shoes, snaps on a favorite coat of mine and he has even repaired a chewed up dog harness for me.  Super nice guy, turn around is fast and affordable.  Great to have someone like him in the neighborhood.< /review>

I’ve been taking various shoe and leather products here for repair and embellishment for a few years now. Good luck finding anything better. Not saying it’s not possible, but this place is a very welcome throwback to a time when we didn’t throw everything away.< /review>

I have gone there a few times in the past for various services with various results.  It’s definitely hit or miss with the customer service.  Sometimes they finish in the time they quote you, sometimes not.  Sometimes they call to let you know if your shoes are not finished, sometimes they don’t.  Sometimes they care that by not calling it can be a waste of your time, sometimes they try to make you feel like asking for a courtesy call is unreasonable.  If the owner saw me and knew I wrote this review chances are he would say I know nothing about running a business and that reviews like this can really harm his business and whatnot.  The flip side is that when you come to a store expecting to receive goods and services and are told then and there your goods and services are incomplete or haven’t started.  That can be really inconvenient and compromising  to the customer.  All while a brief phone call may have prevented such an uncomfortable situation.<//Review>

Same great service that was provided for so long on University ave. New location and most the same staff. Professional, friendly, courteous and knowledgeable staff. Trust leaving your kicks here and getting them a makeover, a touch up or a complete overhaul if needed.
This is the last place you need to know of if you're looking to repair those old but great pair of shoes, boots, sandals or just your favorite pair of kicks. Don't be led astray by negative reviews. Chito's Rocks.<//review>

****THIS PLACE DOESN'T DESERVE YOUR BUSINESS!****

It pains me to write this review as I love supporting neighborhood businesses but the shoemaker is vile.

My order slip said my shoe was going to be ready on Saturday. When I went to pick up the shoe at 11Am on Saturday, the man said it wasn't ready yet. I was understandably frustrated and was wondering what I should do as I had biked to the place and didn't have an hour to wait around as I was supposed to pick up children in a bit. The man didn't apologize, didn't offer any solutions and instead, he lashed out. When I asked why no one had phoned me since the order wasn't ready at the time we had agreed upon, he said I was "being ridiculous." He practically threw the mangled shoe (in process of being repaired) over to me. What an awful experience!<//review>

Friendly, good work delivered when promised. I have had heals put on 3 pair of boots.  All three times the craftsmanship was very good and the boots came back “spiffed up” nicely. This is the same store that was on University for more than a decade.  They moved in early 2014.<//review>

<Text>CAUTION, PATRONS. I urge you to take photos of your shoes before leaving them here. Write the date on your ticket and do NOT question whether the job has been completed or more can be done, lest your shoes be grabbed violently from your hand and ripped apart in front of your eyes. After weeks of cordial and professional treatment, what a nightmare! If I could post photos of the 2 pairs of victims I would.< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>it's a trap. I had a simple sole repair done on my boots to only have them start peeling off a week later. I tried talking to them in person about how their repair job was done poorly. i even suggested to cover the cost of materials but wanted my money back for the time they wasted and the woman in front yelled at me and suggested i "buy a cup off coffee and wait" for the invisible repair man to come out of his hole and explain why he ripped me off. i dont drink coffee.< /Review>< pictures>

Great prices on all in house made juices, mods and accessories. Always friendly and inviting. I come by here for juices and always end up staying and hanging out for a bit. Playing Xbox and hanging with friends is always welcomed. Weekly cloud comps and video game tournaments are a plus... stop in and become part of the Doomsday Army.</review>

I MODIFIED THIS TO A 5☆ RATING FROM A 4☆. BECAUSE THE OWNER PERSONALLY TOOK THE FLAVOR THAT WASN'T TO MY TASTE AND GOT ME EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.

☆NEVER B4 XCHANGE IN A VAPE OR CIG SHOP SERVICE AT A10◇LEVEL☆

Eliquids ARE BEST QUALITY I'VE 👀
THEY'RE THE BEST BECAUSE THEY MAKE YOUR EJUICES WHILE YOU WAIT😲AMAZINGLY UNIQUE.  Anyone who's into the vaping scene can appreciate the freedom to get your nicotine amount,  PG & VG to your own preference and so many 🍑🍏🍍🍌flavors🍅🍒🍰🍧☕🍸 it's almost too much.
In 15 minutes I had professionally labeled 60ml bottles of just what I needed. I've literally been to 50+ vape stores looking for 60/40 or 50/50 at 12-18mg in a taste I don't hate. 2 out of 50 "specialty vape shops" had 1ea that got close. Ordering from the net even is hit & miss.

🏁🏁I'M FINISHED WASTING TIME WITH MY HARD TO FIND TASTES. DOOMSDAY GOURMET HAS IT ALL IN ONE PLACE🏁🏁😃😃

Upon following visits, which is as often as I can, I've seen even more +'s
The Doomsday Gourmet is the premium line with complexities of flavor averaging ~30 ingredients each, their flagship has like 39! All at a price below anything 1/2 as good.
If your needs aren't so sophisticated they offer a Huge Selection of their other house brand " CALI VAPE " which is comparable yet superior to brands like "Naked", "Space Jam", "Charlie's Chalk Dust". Still at any PG/VG ratio and Nic mg's you desire with I believe ~7-12 ingredients each.
On a final note don't miss out on their subscription service offering unbelievable deals a on monthly supplies from ~60mg/month to ~480mg/month in 15ml-120ml bottles so you can check out as many  varieties as you want. For  beginner's it's perfect so you can find out what it is you prefer high VG or cerals, etc...
Can't say enough. If I'd I'd found this place 6 months ago I'd of saved $1000.00!!!!!!
HOPE THIS SAVES YOU WHAT I WENT THROUGH LEARNING ABOUT VAPE. AND SAVE MONEY SO QUITTING SMOKING PAYS OFF ASAP!!< /Text>

Also, seeing as how I carried you, fronted you, and helped you out for 2 straight years when you were begging for liquids and mods, complaining about how your job sucked and you got shorted and diapers cost too much, I don\'t really see where you would get off saying our shop overcharges, Zac.

Great place to go if you want to overpay and be disrespected. The owner Brian is the rudest person I’ve ever met in my life.

(EDIT) as you see from the owners reply they are real professional people.
Haven’t shopped there for over 2 years(maybe longer) just chose to post a review now that I moved back to the area, searched for vape shops near me and this came up.< /Text>

<Review>What can I say that hasn't been said already? Always a great experience when I visit. From the prices to the personnel, this shop has it covered. Easy in and out or stop and chat while your juice is made fresh. The military discount of 30% is a bonus and keeps me coming to this one when in particular.</Review>< Pics>

I will be a repeat customer and I highly recommend this location. they bring in new flavors and let customers test them, when you let them know what you like they bring it in the store so it's customer based af. super dope.</Text>< Time>

Little bit pricey, but I understand why. Great juices and great people. They are very generous with testing and helping out new vaper's. I dropped my bottle of juice right when I walked outside and they instantly without hesitation made another one for me. I cant say enough about the great customer service!!<//review>

Best vape shop hands down. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and actually know what they’re selling. The prices are really fair as well. Obviously it’s not as cheap as ordering online, but as far as brick & mortar places go, these guys are the cheapest in town. For the service these fellas provide, Im okay with paying the extra buck or two and supporting local business.<//review>

They offer over 260 flavors and sell them in a variety of PG/VG ratios dependent on your device as well as options for nicotine strength.

Decided to check this place out since my husband needed some more juice. Tex was great, he recommended a great juice based on what we were looking for. He was really pleasant to talk to and knowledgeable. We've been looking for a vape shop that we can visit regularly and I think we found it. They flavor selection is great and the prices are better than anything we have seen.  As a bonus, they have an Xbox and some couches set up so you can just chill and hang out. Will definitely be coming back here.<//Text>

A brick and mortar store can only carry so much inventory. They should be knowledgeable of each other's inventory and send customers to each other to drive business up for both. I'll be going in later tonight to give them my hard earned money.

Edit: If I could give 10 stars I would! Their moto is definitely "customers first" Conner and Tristan/Gator/Cowboy were so patient with helping me find the right juice! Custom made, in house juices!

Every time I come here I get friendly and excellent service!!

They have the best vape flavors and the best employees as well.  And you get all kinds of discounts here.  I never go anywhere else.

Brian is the best!!  The flavors he has created are the best of any that I've tried in all the years I've been vaping.

Today Sarah helped me.  She's awesome! Super helpful, patient and informative!!

I don't know what I would do without you guys!</Text>

Great place, nice deals.
The people are a little rough around the edges but that's actually part of the charm.
The shop actually makes amazing vape juices, definitely go in and try the Holocaustard!<//review>

<Review>Everytime I come on by the bunker I've had the best ever service with a smile. Knowledge handed down from Brian and his menu is superior to any other shop. While other shops care about the "in" or hot flavor that makes a buzz, this man makes it from scratch. Have an idea like mountain dew. He makes it. Off the wall combo? He has done it. I started vaping because of Brian and will remain a loyal customer till I get put in the ground. The rest of the staff is equal in their knowledge of products and never push for what to buy. They listen and find what would be the best option in mod and juice based on you.  And still to this day halocustard is still my always go to vape juice.</Review>< pics>

<time>1545009232128<//time><rate>2<//rate><Review>Best store I've ever had the pleasure to visit. Hands down, not even just best vape store, best store period. The staff was all super friendly and genuine, the vibe is amazing, and they treated us like we were people and not just a potential sale. Definitely going back, and anyone reading this should absolutely check them out.

EDIT:  I don't know what happened, maybe it's because the people who worked here before all left, but this last trip to Vape Bunker was extremely disappointing. The main guy talking to my husband and me seemed very intent on selling us anything and everything, did not listen to what we were asking for, and came off as very arrogant despite my husband having to correct him on the different products in the store multiple times. I felt bad for the girl working there because she seemed really unhappy, and the second dude did nothing but provide joke commentary to everything and make fun of the girl for not knowing how to change her atomizer properly. The pleasant atmosphere is totally gone, and we left feeling uncomfortable with how pushy the main guy was in trying to sell us stuff we didn't want. Maybe we'll come back in a few more months and try again, but I'm not looking forward to it like I was last time.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Very happy with the service here, I bought a 120 ml bottle here.  After trying to vape it for like 3 weeks because it was too harsh I went back to buy another bottle of something else. When I told the gentleman at the counter what was happening he asked to try it and he did after he tried it he automatically new that they mixed too much nicotine in it. He apologized and made me a new bottle for free pulse I bought some more liquid. Bottom line

Great customer service
Best selection I've seen so far
Quilty liquid it takes time to make "but hey I'll wait for it cause it's worth it"

Thanks guys<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1528681752586, 'text': 'Thank you for your great review, David!'}< /resp><GmapID>0x809aded909f7c56f:0x2569ddfd5526b372</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Very helpful and polite employees. They have a tasting bar: pay a dollar and taste all you want with one of their in store vapes and the dollar goes towards your purchase. They also make their own mixes of vape juice. Never had an unpleasant visit to the store. Would give the fifth star if I was greeted upon walking in.<//Review>

Super unhappy with this place. I just burnt threw three coils in a week n two within ten minutes of one another. The shop wouldn’t take ownership this he misinformed me on how to prime my coil. Instead blamed it on the fact I’m using baked juice. Then continues to tell me to control the wattage. I said to him three different times it’s the prince stuck I can’t control the wattage. I dint vape for the cloud i vape to help me quit smoking cloves. Super super unhappy and I will not visit this location again. Pissed</review>

I would invite you to come in with the device so that we can go over the proper way to prime the coils to prevent premature failure. I'm not familiar myself with the brand Baked Juice, but I can look it up if you can give me the flavor name and the nicotine strength, as some flavors need different wattage characteristics and that particular brand may not be ideal for your setup."}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x809aded909f7c56f:0x2569ddfd5526b372</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Amazing atmosphere honest workers. Always high quality. They know there stuff here you can tell all the workers here are extremely passionate about what they do. They also have a good atmosphere and customer base to which is one of my biggest issues with other vape chains. This is by far my favorite shop i've gone too.<//text>

<review>Super slow service and while I was waiting for 30 minutes me and my friend were accused of stealing a mod . Even though another employee tried to give his mod back he didn't apologize.  I had to listen to racist jokes that made us uncomfortable.
Regret entirely spending a dime & waiting the absurd amount of time it took,, If this was the last vape shop in sac I would chose cigarettes.<//review>< gmapID>

We explain to all customers that their liquids will be mixed and steeped, and the quality of the product definitely makes the wait worth it. I don't recall you being accused of stealing anything, I myself misplaced my own mod and I asked one of the guys where he had put it, but didn't mention you stealing it in the slightest. My only mention during that incident is that it was on the bar when he was showing you mods, no longer was, and I asked him where it was. As for the jokes, we're an adult establishment, 21+ and while people can tend to get comfortable in an environment like that, I'll definitely tell them to tone down the flavor, for sure."}<//resp>

They guys there are hella cool. Called ahead 15 mins to ask for a bottle a juice to be made fresh. Got there and was short 6$ and a guy working there took it out of his wallet and handed it to me. Bought a 120ml bottle of Caramel Hazelnut Coffee of their handcrafted juices (made in store.) was still warm when he handed it to me. All in all was awesome service and was a great deal. I’ll recommend this to all my friends that vape and already have. They also post videos often to Facebook so check them out there.< /text>

<Text>I have had the pleasure of working with them now for going on 3 years and one of the best company's I've ever worked with ! Our shop is in Pittsburgh PA and I'm proud to say we are a retail location that carries Doomsday Gourmet and will continue to do so. From the owners to the employees they've done everything to make sure our experience is always top priority. I most definitely recommend them as a shop and most definitely as a premium juice distributer ! !

<text>I went in this week to check out the shop and was totally blown away. The friendly environment, expert staff hit it out of the park for me. I have been to other local shops that are just interested in getting your money. I want to cloud chase and they explained what i would need to accomplish it and they have contests every friday night. I am going to start buying all my liquid there because i can get them in 120 ml which you cant find in other shops unless its a special order.  I learned a lot just hanging out and talking to the owner and the staff.  Most the other local shops don't explain what people need to know about vaping such as the safety part and the difference in the types of mods, batteries and juices. You go in, spend a ton of money then they push you out the door. Vape Bunker is not like that, they explain everything before you go.
04/11 Update I went in today and purchased a mech mod, battery charger and 2 sets of batteries along with several bottles of delicious liquid. Again, the staff knocked it out of the park! They are very professional, friendly. They are hands down the best vape shop in sacramento. They took over an hour explaining that about using my new mod and didn't once try to rush me out the door. This is my favorite place to shop and hang out now. I was like a little kid in a candy store today and walked out with a very big smile.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1492843720433, 'text': "Thank you so much for your kind words, Gene.

Exceptionally fast and friendly service! I’ve been using NuggMD for my medical referral needs for several years, and they never ever disappoint.

Their representatives are fast, friendly, and efficient. Rec is delivered instantly via PDF and a paper copy follows swiftly via regular mail.

Huge thanks to the amazing NuggMD team for their swiftness and compassion. They’re the best in the business!< /Text>

The site was easy to use and follow. The text before the call, letting you know they’re about to call you, is super smart because you’re already in line after your form completion, which is a very short wait already. Mine was super quick, 2 minutes maybe. The doctor was very friendly. This was really easy. Period. Thanks<//review>

I am a returning customer and it was so easy to use. I just looked them up online and reassessed my account and followed a couple easy step, then the doctor called to confirm I was the right person and re-approved me. Right after I got off the phone with the doctor I got my email with my approval letter. See you next year.

The reason I chose 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that they still don’t deliver in my area.  Other than that their pretty fantastic..</Review>

I have been smoking and growing my own medicine, for almost 20 years now. I was, with my 1st Doc. For 18 years. Last year was a scramble! This year was so easy and not a stress at all. It took me about 20min.and I was done. I didn't even have to leave the house. It has been a day now, and I have received a notice that my license is on the way.!!! Two days! I have already told my friends that this is the place to go. Thank you for your time and consideration.< /Text>

The process was so simple and fast. It was also a really good deal. I received my recommendation within a minute after my evaluation was complete. I recommend NuggMD to anyone looking to get there medicinal marijuana card.</review>

Getting a recommendation here is very fast and easy. You just sign up online and a doctor will call you shortly after and tell you whether you were approved or not. If you were not approved, they do not charge you. I did my research before going with NuggMD, and I was not disappointed. I would recommend.<//review>

I have been utilizing this doctor for the past 4 years and each year I am so grateful and appreciative for the compassion of the employees and the genuine concern for making sure that my medical needs are met.
This is not just a place to get your med card, if you have questions or need advice about what to smoke, how or when, the doctor is available to answer the questions and give sound safe advice you can trust.< /Text>

Great service, very easy to use, 10/10 overall. Just log onto the website and pay your $39 or $59 fee (in California), then a doctor will call you for a few minutes and confirm your card. Highly recommend!<//review>

Very easy process to get my medical card. Signed up, uploaded ID and got a call right after my purchase. Doctor was really nice and understanding and they sent me my medical recommendation right after. Still got a wait a few days for my card to come in the mail. Overall good service and I would recommend this to a friend</text>

All you need to do is log ur info and wait less than 5 minutes to answer a call with a REAL doctor that only lasts 30 seconds and boom you’re set! I got the PDF in my email in seconds so I used it as soon as I paid. if I can I’ll add how long shipping takes for the physical card and letter.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have now used this service twice and I have never had a problem with their customer service or function of the service. I got my referral the same day and the call from the Dr was straight forward and respectful. I would definitely recommend using this service if you are looking for a medical referral.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I was a little nervous at first thinking the process would be over whelming, but it couldn't be more opposite. The process was super fast and easy and before I knew it, I was receiving a call from the doctor confirming my info and within 30 seconds I had my 215.    10/10 would recommend.</Text>< pics>

The process is very easy and quick I was approved in about 15 minutes! The doctor I spoke to was kind and very caring. She was so hopeful to see how effective medical cannabis will be for me! The customer service is wonderful! Truly not a bad word to say!</text>

Nugg MD was recommended by my dispensary. They are very nice and very fast. They went through my medical history and discussed things with me.  It was well worth it. In California if you are a medical patient there are different parameters to work within that make life easier if you rely on Medical Marijuana for disease control.</review>

<text>My friend told me about NuggMD. I was so nervous but the entire process was so prompt,  courteous and professional,  I was so impressed and amazed.
The doctor put me at ease.  Being that I deal with anxiety and PTSD the process was so smooth.
Thank you NuggMD.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Text>Unless you're interested in the following, stick with NuggMD.
1. Excessive fees
2. Red Tape
3. Judgement for having health problems
4. Criticism for finding cannabis a helpful addition to your life
5. Grief for being a hypocrite for once vilifying cannabis, and then using it
6. Agism
7. Wasting your time
8. Rude doctors
9. People who want you to suffer, and struggle</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I made an account, sat in a “waiting room” for maybe 3 minutes, website told me to expect a call at anytime, 30 seconds later I answered the call and had a relaxed and nice conversation with one of the NuggMD employees. The discussion wasn’t too personal nor lazy. 2 minute phone call and we talked about how our lives were similar and why I needed my card. Thanks y’all!</text>

This is the friendliest, most efficient and by far the most authentic medical cannabis approval process I've experienced to date. Kudos to the doctor and to the staff that hopped on to offer deals going forward. I am so grateful to the Nuggs and am on the waitlist for Nugg Club deliveries. Thank you all.</Review>

I am a new patient and I was not to sure how I was going to go about it. But after talking with my doctor I was needing to register for a medical cannabis card. When I was recommended to try and get a easy and painless evaluation with NuggMD.com, It was truly a painless and easy process and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  Thanks NuggMD.com for granting those special powers I needed for my pains...</Text>

They were able to help right away. A Doctor contacted me the same day I applied to help with my needs. I currently suffer from migraines, muscle spasms and stress. I have trouble taking medications everyday and in a timely manner. This process was a lot better.</Text>

They genuinely care about what we are facing medically and stand behind us to ensure we are not alone and reassure they will do whatever it takes to make sure we are 100%. Loved the energy. Definitely recommend to those who are going through medical conditions.<//Review>

I seeked help for a pinched nerve in my back which was impossible due to covid causing physical and massage therapists to close. So the pain intensified so much I contacted this company. They made the process so easy. The doctor is so easy to talk to and cares about the patients. Just had my renewal the other day and it was a smooth, simple process. Don't hesitate to get help from NuggMD!< /Text>

<Text>When people think of a Medical Marijuana card they just think immediately weed, Marijuana, Mary Jane or however you want to refer to it a.k.a drugs but to me a non smoker it's more than that. It truly has its Medical benefits. You should really read more into the powerful benefits of CDB treatments especially those with various forms of Arthritis, tendonitis, and other muscle related health issues. I believe having this card has treated me well and as a 2nd year user from Nugg I haven't had any issues, I haven't had to wear my hand braces, and I been OK. I think you should trust in Nugg because they do offer many benefits that will help you medically. I also notice depending on which cannabis club you may go to having this card gives you many discounts at various clubs.</Text><response>None</response>< pics>

Amazing service with knowledgeable doctors. The service is the best I’ve ever used. After 3 years, I keep going back.  And they have a fantastic new curated mailing service.  I have recommended NuggMD to everyone I know with cannabis needs.   I’ll be back again. Thanks NuggMD!< /Review>

But then I had a few questions on my call with a gentleman who was very rude and condescending. I asked him not to speak to me like that and how dare him speak to another adult like that. He then got even more rude and said he’s just going to cancel the whole transaction then hung up on me. This is not how to run a business. I won’t stop complaints until I hear from the CEO himself with an apology.  The picture on this review is my medical card but it’s rejected again because the gentleman was very rude. Hope you guys record your phone calls.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><name>KINGPRINCE SHOW< /name></record>

The process was pretty informative but easy and I was kind of worried it wasn’t going to be an official site to get my medical card. But turns out I felt comfortable after speaking with the doctor and once I was verified it felt real so I honestly recommend it to those who might have second thoughts!!< /text>

Yes, Pot is legal, however if you don't have a card or dr recommendation, (some not all) Cops will still harass you even if you use it medicinally, even moreso if you have kids. I hate pills, and unnatural methods to heal your mind or body. These guys, are quick, friendly, affordiable, plus give you local shops with details on the place.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Something you should know, the rec and ID do not qualify for eliminating taxes...SO
if you don't want to pay taxes, you have to take this Recommendation to the state to get a MMIC (medical marijuana identification Card) for "about $100" as the site says (Nugg will link you to the site).  SO you'll be out about $160 in order to avoid paying taxes...< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dbf59b16db3373:0xb9f550bb8487401e<//Gmap_id>< rating>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>My family doctor informed me that he wasn’t going to participate in Missouri’s MMJ.  I searched the web and found NuggMD.  I did a lot of checking before going with them, being the cautious type. Their endorsements were excellent so I jumped in.  The application, payment, and virtual doctor consultation were extremely professional. I felt assured they had my best interests in mind.  Received the physician recommendation within a few hours and immediately got my application off to the State.  Now the wait for the approved application and the opening of dispensaries.
Highly recommend NuggMD to anyone considering medical marijuana participation.  Professional, friendly, and affordable.< /Text>< Pics>

I seen there advertisement and decided to give them a call. There was a number I texted that sent me back a link on how to apply for a medical marijuana license. The link was very easy to follow and fill out. After filling out the application I was informed that the doctor would be with me to have a telephone conference with her. After about  a 10 minute wait I was on the phone with the doctor. The phone call lasted for about 10 minutes with the doctor asking me about my health and had I ever tried medical marijuana  before. As I had explain to her that I  was in California  several months ago and tried it out there and found it to help with the pain for throat cancer  that I was recovering from. After the doctor asked several more questions she approved me for applying for my medical marijuana license.  They supplied all the links you needed to complete complete the application process. After up loading all the information they required  I  paid the 26.50 to the state and I am now waiting to see if the state approves me and sends me my license.  The whole process took about 2 hours from start to finish. If your interested  in getting a medical marijuana license I  would strongly recommend  NuggMD to help you get your license and help with the pain. Chester</review>

<name>Ace KC<//name><review>My doctor Maria with exceptionally understanding my medical conditions I was able to receive card recommendations within the afternoon just hours after taking the interview video chat so painless so hassle free but if anybody wants to get it done right and not invasive or uncomfortable questioning. Then this is the place for you $99 that's it very professional forever grateful now I have to do is do the state application which I just finished which was also painless all done from my living room within one day I became officially legal that feeling priceless but thanks nuggmd you are the number one spot< /review>< Rate>

The site is easy to navigate and breaks everything down into simple steps. The doctor was quickly available, and the site sends updates to let you know when the doctor is ready for the video conference. My doctor was prepared, having read the medical information I had submitted, professional, and had a good 'bed-side' manner. It was easy to open up and discuss my myriad of ailments. The doctor was also very knowledgeable about how MMJ may affect how certain medications could react differently. I received confirmation within about 4 hours and had my certification to submit to the state within about 24 hours. Great communication and, overall, a very good experience. I would recommend NuggMD to anyone seeking their MMJ patient card in MO!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Super easy, fast way to get evaluated for medical marijuana.  The doc was really friendly and the process was quick.  Plus it was the cheapest online eval I could find.  I totally recommend.< /text>

<Text>I loved Dr. Maria Garcia. I was skeptical of course but she answered all of my questions thoroughly and had a genuine concern for my experience with precious doctors regarding my injuries and pain management. She said I was well informed on what I DIDN’T want and glad I had asked the questions I did! I would highly recommend this place to EVERYONE!!<//Text>< pics>

I had an excellent professional experience with NuggMD.

The wait time was only about 5 minutes until video chat with a doctor.

I would recommend using this service!

The process was user friendly and clear.  The doctor came on to video chat almost immediately, was easy to talk to, answered questions and that was it. Dr Garcia is a great doctor also.< /review>

He made sure to answer any questions I had and that was it. Registered my rec with the state a day later and I was alerted that it was approved within a few minutes.

<Review>It took no time to get my flower power card from them. You tell them some of your issues why your in need of flower. Fill a little paperwork out and they call you within 10 to 15 minutes. You get to personally take to someone. Ask you about what you fill out. Then you receive an approved email if you pass. After that you go get you some legal flower. Thank God for them.....in only 15 to 20 minutes you will be legal.<//Review>< Pictures>

im going to start off with saying that I live in NY, everything was done from my home state on a cellphone. I simply created an account, answered a few quick questions on a survey, uploaded screenshots of certain medical documents, spoke to an actual doctors for less than 5 minutes and BOOM! 149$ later I have my LEGAL AND LEGIT medical marijuana card. Register with the state and all done. Prior to any of this I had a ton of questions and the customer service "live chat" was a godsend they were professional yet super friendly, answered all my questions even informed me that I would only be charged IF I was approved! Response time was decent as well. Long story short this saved me MONTHS time waiting to physically see a doctor not to mention they are definitely cheaper, VERY SATISIFIED, would definitely recommend< /text>

<review>The whole experience was quick and easy. I was skeptical but as the process went on I felt more comfortable. The video consultation took like 10 mins. The Dr was great, as was the consultation and I was approved right away, Dr even provided a few suggestions about what to do afterwards.</review></record>

< Review>
Amazing -- whole process took maybe half an hour (including the doctor visit!!). Efficient system - only hiccup was issue on my iphone loading a page after the doctor visit, but the virtual help team answered me within two minutes and got me redirected on my PC to the right area to complete what I was doing. Absolutely wonderful, thank you so much nuggmd!< /Review>

I was a little hesitant at first, it seemed too good to be true. After about 2 days contemplating I gave it a try. I spoke to a dr in a matter of minutes and got my approval and recommendation within hours. The dr was super nice and professional!< /Review>

<text>I am very pleased with the services from NuggMD, for several reasons. 1) It is very easy to complete the approval process. 2) In case of rejection, the payment is reimbursed. 3) Very competitive prices, compared to other online providers for California as of today. 4) The doctor called me shortly after I completed the application. From the phone call, it was very clear that he had reviewed my submitted information. He also answered some extra questions that I had, which I really appreciated. 5) The PDF was available immediately after the doctor approved my application. I agree with another review that it was a bit difficult to locate the PDF on the webpage, but this is not a big problem, and it can be fixed e.g. by writing "look further down on the page for your PDF" or something similar. It is also readily available to download from the getnugg.com profile. 6) In addition, the actual printed and stamped recommendation is supposed to arrive in just some days in the mail.

Thank you!<//text><Rating>5<//Rating>< user>

<Text>Well, I must say that the Nugg team is special. I have quite a bit of anxiety, and quite a bit more when it came to me getting a med card. I’ve been on anxiety meds most of my life and as well meds for migraine and resantly meds for my back after getting hurt at work. The meds in turn have now caused damage to my stomach lining. So ya, marijuana was brought to my attention.  One medication for all the above and no damages to my body!!! The doctor was fantastic!!  She eased my anxiety and helped me understand the benefits of cannabis and it’s medical applications!!

Thank You
