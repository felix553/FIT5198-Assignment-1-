<text>First time using their service. I was really impressed. The dental office was
very clean and the workers were extremely nice and friendly. The office
layout made it very efficient to move from station to station. I can't believe
I enjoyed my dental visit which I never ever liked. My hat off to the dentist and it's crew. Great job and keep it up!!<//text>< pics>

As a Marine Veteran I’m pretty picky about certain things and usually have at least one complaint when I post reviews but honestly I haven’t found one here yet. My two children love it here just as much as I do so that is a huge plus. I’d like to say to the ladies at the front desk all the way to the back where the work is being done , keep up the amazing customer service and Dental Work !

I came to this dentist solely based off the reviews and I am comfortable saying that it was a great experience! I hadn't been to the dentist in about 6 years but was having some issues with a tooth so I decided it was time to go in. They were able to get me in quick as a new patient and everything went as smooth as I could've expected and they were super informative and let me know about everything as it was happening! They were even able to give me a full price breakdown of the stuff I need done so that I could be prepared in the future! Thank you to the staff and the doctor for taking care of me!<//review>

The staff is amazing, friendly, accommodating and overall highly professional. They actually care about their patents and even remember small details. I can’t stress how much I love this dentist office.

Working in a form of healthcare and patient service myself, it’s extremely comforting to see just how important these things are from a patients perspective. A++!</Review>

<review>Poor business practices!!  Provide dental work not covered by insurance then, ofcourse, expect payment. As the person paying, I should have preauthorized it. Now there are late charges on a  balance i didn't know existed! Months later decide to finally call regarding balance.< /review>< date>

I was impressed with the process of checking in when I arrived for my appointment given the Covid19 situation.  My appointment went well.   Dr. Coelho and all her staff are so pleasant and thorough.  They have the latest technology in all their equipment.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is seeking a dentist in Visalia.< /review>

Over the last two years I was living in New York City to complete my master's degree, during which time I refused to get my dental work done anyplace else (I needed several restorations). I managed to schedule all of my appointments with Dr. Coelho during my breaks from school – the staff were very professional and friendly even when I called to inquire about cancelled appointments (on several occasions) so I could be seen by Dr. Coelho on a particular date during my breaks. Dr. Coelho listens very intently and really cares about making your experience one of the best! The one time I had a routine cleaning done in New York City, the dentist emailed me after my appointment to ask if he could have the contact information for Dr. Coelho's office saying: "I want to commend your previous dentist on doing great restorations for you, they are above the standard." If you're looking for one of the best dentists around, go see Dr. Coelho!< /text>

<review>I’ve been a patient of Dr. Coelho since she opened her practice here in Visalia and I must say it’s a very pleasant dentist experience. Her dental hygienists are very patient and thorough, and understanding of your concerns. The office is always very clean and has nice modern layout, as well as convenient location on Main Street. I definitely recommend her as your family dentist.<//review><user_id>105912712338393295118< /user_id>< user_name>

< Review>
My father in law had a problem, a broken tooth still attached to a post. So I called Dr Coelho’s office and they got him in within an hour. I won’t say that this would happen every time or for everyone. Could have been a slow day maybe someone canceled their appointment. I don’t know suffice to say they took care of the problem. Thanks for being there when we need you.

Like most people  I get anxious  and nervous  before a visit to the dentist , Dr.
Coelho is  gentle  and  caring, her staff is  friendly .  I would highly
recomend  to anyone  looking for a family dentist to  visit  Dr Coelhos, she and her staff  make sure  you will  have a  welcoming  and  comfortable  experiences.</text>

Dr. Coelho and her staff are amazing. I have always hated the dentist as many people do, but I don’t worry about it anymore.</text>

<review>I've been using this office for almost two years now and I've never had a bad experience with Dr. Coelho or her staff. If you're looking for dental services in Visalia, I highly recommend them.< /review>< Time>

The office is very clean and the staff is very friendly. I love how they make you feel so comfortable. They even ask if you would like a blanket to cover your legs while you wait for the Dr. to see you. I love that !! I just took my son thier and he loved is as well. I recommend Dr Coelho anytime.</review>

Had a check-up cleaning and a few fillings replaced. The staff and Dr. Coelho were very through and professional.  Prices seem fair, billing is transparent, and procedure was as painless as possible. Also enjoyed how the office is very tech-savy even sending text reminders about my appointment and I was able to fill pre-paperwork out online. Great office in Visalia!<//text>

<Review>I’ve been seeing Dr. Coelho for over a year now and cannot see myself going to anyone else, even since I’ve moved to Clovis!! Their facility feels fresh and new and is always very CLEAN.  I typically dread dental appointments because I have sensitive teeth and TMJ, and I’ll typically endure some kind of pain during the visit.  However, when I visit Dr. Coelho’s office I don’t experience any pain.  Dr. Coelho and both hygienists I have seen have been very gentle and soft when they work with me.  They actually care about your comfort which has been one of primary traits I’ve sought after.  Nothing is worse than having someone with large fingers try and work in a small mouth and rushing to complete the task before your numb!

If you want a great Dental experience visit Dr Coelho, you will not be disappointed!<//Review><Date>1567875612108</Date>< pictures>

I was terrified of going to the Dintest, so much so that I had not been in over a decade. They were able to keep me calm and do all the work I needed. I'm so grateful that I found this place.<//Review>

My daughter saw Dr. Coelho for her first visit to the dentist.  Dr. Coelho had great patience and took great care of Raelynn.  As a parent I appreciated the high level of comfort & relaxation Dr. Coelho achieve with my daughter.  Her staff is top notch, we had a very enjoyable and professional experience</text>

<review>just a few minutes away from the bustle of Hwy 80 in Vallejo. A small venue with an open kitchen that delivers an excellent variety of tastes and offers wine parings as well. For what you get it's a good value. They offer a set menu - no substitutions or alternative offerings. Great for omnivores.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5<//rate><review>This is simply the best Thai food restaurant in Vallejo. The food is just incredibly tasty and flavorful. If you want to try Thai food, you need to go for the best. I love when I go there at night and they have live music. The price is good. Their Thai ice tea is the bomb. Too bad is not refillable.  Their employees are always very friendly and super helpful.  Whenever I go there with my family, we order yellow curry, thai fried rice with shrimps, pad see ew, and fried vegetables with pork or chicken. You should try. This place is definitely my favorite.</review>< Pics>

Although it was busy. we didn’t wait an unreasonable amount of time and the food was excellent. I had a red curry with eggplant, which was superb. My wife ordered pad tai, the old standby, also very good. Recommended.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Three years ago we eat there with my son on my birthday as we are in the middle of dinner we saw baby cockroaches...in respect we stop immediately eating and still pay for the food. Then last week me and my girlfriend decided to try thinking maybe the sanitation is better but in the middle of our lunch we saw ngat flying and crawling over the fried rice,rib eye steak was so salty and not well done as we want also carpets smells so bad and Cook and employees are not dressed properly....I am going to call the City of Vallejo to report this filthy restaurant.</review>

I had been going here for about 4 years. If I had written this review 3 years into my regular visits, I would have given it 4 stars--tasty food but mediocre service.

So why the demotion to 2 stars?

This is my experience the last three times I've ordered takeout (I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but now I'm done):

1. Ordered a tofu curry. Got home and realized that they had given me the beef version of the curry. Had to drive back to get my proper order. Nothing comped for my troubles.

2. Ordered the same tofu curry. Checked that it was correct. Got home and on the last bite, bit into a chunk of...pork? chicken? Something definitely NOT tofu.

3. Ordered my usual tofu curry. Get home. Realize that there are small bits of shredded meat throughout my dish.

Sigh. Luckily, my tofu-love is not the result of a severe dietary restriction or rigid moral positions, but it was still incredibly distasteful to have meat in what was meant to be a meat-free dish.

I don't know what happened--a cook change? Lax quality control?--but after three times in a row, I just cannot justify going back, and this had been my favorite Thai place in town.

It has been a while since this experience, so hopefully they have fixed this issue, but I was severely disappointed with these problems and have not been back since.</review>

Owner walks around as if he owns the place ... which he does of course ... but the attitude displayed is not pleasurable at all. He needs to be a bit more humble and welcoming. Plus the Thai green curry came out over-cooked to the point of stew and not pleasant at all.<//review>

<Name>LaRae Ganch</Name><Text>Horrible service..........We were a party of two.....Ordered calamari appetizer and dinner items. Calamari was good. Only one dinner came out. After 10 minutes asked where the other dinner was and they said they ran out of that item.  We asked, "And when were you going to tell us this?"  They never even told us the item was out OR even asked is there something else you would like to order.  Immediately got a box to go for existing dinner and went home.  Other person ended up ordering McDonald's and we went home. It totally ruined a nice dinner out for two!!!< /Text>< rate>

This spot is one of two Thai restaurants in Vallejo. It's good, to be sure, but when you've eaten at other Thai restaurants in the bay, it's not anything that's all that special in particular.

First and foremost, this place is probably one of the better spots in Vallejo if you're craving something that's in the realm of ethnic cuisine. The decor and overall environs of the restaurant are nice and clean. Almost a tropical feel to this place. Energy and vibe are great too. Some Friday nights, there's even local live music which is really nice. Staff here are consistently friend and helpful. Service is always fast, even when it's packed.

Now, the food itself. I've ordered the majority of the stuff on the menu within the 12 year span that I've been frequenting this place. Curries, pad thai, spicy dishes, grilled meats, and the seafoods. All of it? Good food and by no means bad at all. But having since also visited other Thai restaurants, I will say that the food here is not spectacular. But again, the food here is not bad at all. If you're local and not looking to set foot outside of the city, I would recommend this place (though Ano Thai Lao might be a better choice, depending on your location in the city.) This place is OK overall.</review>

<Text>Had a bad experience. Ordered veggie yellow curry and started eating and my wife found a meat piece in it. Just a apology and they gave us veggie one. Still was charged.

Had a fly in the Thai ice tea. Gave a new one,  apology and was charged again. We were too tired to fight that night.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808572d5961d0141:0x104fb9da48fc825e<//gmapID></record>

Service is as others have said, leaving more to be desired. However, the yellow beef curry, the #30 garlic beef, and the mango sticky rice do not. Come for the Thai ice tea, not the service.</Text>

Awesome place with Ukes from beginner to professional. Ric is super nice and knowledgable and takes his time to explain anything you want to know. My only question is: when will my fingers stop being numb?</Review>

Worth a 2 Hour drive from the orange county area and endure traffic. Ric is a great upstanding, and helpful person. Great selection of ukes. very helpful and friendly service. Laid-back atmosphere in the spirit of aloha. Like a uke shop should be. Mahalo Ric. If you’re in the area stop in and check it out.< /review>

THE SHOP IS ON THE LEFT CORNER NEAR THE PARKING LOT! Very specialized shop for ukulele players.

Better than Guitar Center, in my opinion. Lots of high-end models/brands, accessories, and learning material.

Pretty much everything you need and a little more to get you started or to improve.

I walked in planning to purchase a 5 or 6 string tenor ukulele But walked out with a Kala Baritone. Amazing tone and projection. It was the sound I was looking for.

Before my purchase, I tried out a few 6 strings tenors and then a super tenor, and then a few  costing over $1,000. He helped me with my searching process and made excellent recommendations.

Highly recommended 5/5

Thank you Hale Ukulele!

Can't wait for COVID to be over so I can become more involved in the ukulele scene.< /review>

Ric was amazing. I chose a tenor uke that i really liked and he recommended some things to help really make it my own. He added bumps for a strap and pointed out some custom made ones that i fell in love with right away. He also let me try playing a few of the more rare ukuleles while he worked. Beautiful selection of instruments and gear paired with great customer service. So glad i came here instead of guitar center. Thanks!<//review>

I came in for a simple one string replacement and not only did they replace it but they also showed me how to do it myself if I ever needed to. If you let them they will give you some pretty great advice and tips on any ukulele interest you might have from classes to models and strings and such. Their parking lot can be tricky to find so when you’re near drive carefully.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Took my dad's Martin Uke here to see if the guy had any info on it. I just wanted info as it only has the Martin logo, and made in Pennsylvania on it. So he pompously dumps a huge Martin serial # book, then after much frustrated page turning he comes to the conclusion I'd already reached, no serial #, it's a mystery. Then since he had no idea what Martin Ukulele it was he tried to lowball appraise the instrument, $1500 less than my dad was quoted. I wouldn't go back to this store the owner is one "Crazy G!"< /Text>

<Review>BUYER BEWARE!!! I purchased a 2 year old BMW X5 from United Imports. After discussing with Peter (the owner) I paid them extra to repair a few blemishes on the wheels. Within a few months of this repair, the paint on my wheels started to chip off. After 2 years of back-and-forth with Sandy (dishonest saleswoman) and Peter (the owner) they finally agreed to fix my completely dilapidated wheels.

Instead of doing it the right way, it turns out they just spray painted my wheels. I was speechless. They literally just spray painted over the chipping paint and dirt. There were massive chips and globs streaking paint and documented it all in detailed pictures. It even got on the tires. When I showed Sandy she said “it looks great!” Unbelievable. Even worst, the color of the paint was completely different than the color of the other two wheels on the car. Not only did they do a terrible job fixing the wheels from the start (which I paid for), they did an even worse job the second time around, after months and years of discussion at that.

To ensure I wasn’t being unreasonable, I got 3 separate professional opinions on their work and each shop was astonished that any reputable company would do such a thing. To fix this hack job I had to pay $1,200 to get the paint they put on the wheels burned off and completely refinished.

Peter, Sandy, and the entire staff at United Imports are DISHONEST. They epitomize the “sleazy used car salesman” stereotype and they have no regard for integrity. DO NOT TRUST ANYTHING THEY TELL YOU. If you don’t believe me, read through the other reviews.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxpWR16Ac9qsb8HKb5C0vS9FLNZ70-ACHUDkG8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXVFzf03X91BrbtDb0g162fRFqgQfb8JfBrJ76=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlEtRlOwyLk-hXWBuPPmQRszAl5LHx-TVYsv2V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPswbaL3WL6Bnd5m-X4xdXcdgpTYnMceXkx5gID=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ9pAoR7INYBu3vCb3l-5LgkmCwyQw4x44SlTN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvtMI9_REu90ErMzXt-RTwlkd-IROIAWeoLu-t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKfAE2hg4qB20zJ940rp1G4qyOgHlzzs89PCqs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Date>

< review>
Covid compliance was very low. Sales person jumped in the back seat without asking and was in our face in the enclosed space. This is the only dealership we have been to where the sales person insisted that they come along on the test drive. We did not end up doing a test drive. The employee break room is in the main show room and several employees were not wearing masks in the show room while eating. We got the impression that they have an extremely relaxed attitude about covid here<//review>

Conclusion first: Highly satisfied, would return again, would recommend to others.
I bought a car from United Imports about a month ago. They have broad selection of luxury brands. Lopez and others helped me to narrow down and make decision after multiple visits. At first, I was concerned about their polarized customer reviews– either hate or love. But most negative reviews are regarding customer service, particularly on how they weren’t immediately able to meet/speak with a sales person when walked in. United Imports is a busy shop for their good selections and prices, hence it is reasonable to expect to wait unless you have an appointment. Common sense. I certainly had pleasant experience with them. Lopez was very reasonable, knowledgeable, honest, and personable. After all, I’m happy with my decision and would recommend United Imports for my acquaintance.</text>

I've conducted extensive research and watched the market for months before making a purchase to try and find the lowest prices. United imports consistently showed up on many make and models. Horacio was my sales rep, highly recommend him if you enjoy a no pressure, stress free, honest conversation about the vehicles. He's been in the business for over 15 years, very knowledgeable and goes out of his way to make sure you get the best experience. His actions really stand out as above and beyond, never would have expected the sales rep trying to buff out scratches and filling in spots with touch up paint. FYI they will be transitioning heavier on the BMW side and less on Mercedes.<//review>

I understand stuff happens and gets missed but lights and bulbs are a safety issue and should be inspected and fixed correctly. This did not keep us from purchasing a vehicle. We still bought it. Just a heads up and reminder when you’re buying a new/used car. Inspect everything yourself. Don’t trust the person that gets paid 13 bucks an hour to be thorough on an investment like this.<//Text><Name>El Gap0h</Name>< Gmap_id>

You'll be in and out real quick when buying a car.
Loans are provided through many many banks they partner with.
You will find a good selection of imported cars such as bmw, Mercedes and Maserati, and
If you are into German cars be sure to walk in and you'll like what you see.
I myself love German cars but ended it up with a Subaru STI driving out because of the good deal I got.

Thanks for the business buddy!< /text>< pictures>

Our experience at United Imports was  great!   My husband and I were not too sure about purchasing from a dealership, however united Imports has very personable and friendly employees as well as clean  vehicles with low mileage.   Sandra our sales representative was very enjoyable to work with. Sandra was knowledgeable, helpful and truly wanted us to find the very best car that fit our needs. Sandra spent quite a bit of time with us, she was very patient and professional as we proceeded to look around.  We are very satisfied with the Mercedes we purchased that day at United Imports . We will highly recommend them to family and friends. Thanks again to Sandra for  making the time that we searched for our perfect vehicle  so fun and enjoyable !! 😊<//Text>

<username>Che Lopez< /username><Time>1565845243324<//Time><rating>2< /rating><text>I would have given a 2.5 star rating, vice 2 star rating if it was possible.
That's because half of my experience was great but the other half, not so great.  They have a great inventory of vehicles and good prices to go along with them.  The testing and purchasing process was also quick and seamless.  However, if you are going to call yourself a dealership, you have to do a better job servicing the vehicles on your lot.  My son had to go back to college in less than two days so I didn't have time to take the vehicle to a local mechanic to check it out before purchasing it so the morning prior to picking up the vehicle, I asked the salesman if the service of the vehicle was up to date because I was driving the vehicle to Texas in 100 degree weather and was told it was but the coolant light came on after the first day and when I topped off the coolant, I noticed that the windshield wiper reservoir was completely empty.  Then, on the second night, we drove through a thunderstorm and found that the windshield wipers were ripped and torn.  I have to say I was disappointed to find out the hard way that the service wasn't up to date and that the 20 point inspection that I was assured had been done was not completed.  It was also disappointing to find out that only one key was available and the owners manual was removed.  I've been assured that they will get me an owners manual but we'll see.</text>< Pictures>

Samson was very professional and answered all of my questions over the phone. He told me about the car in detail and did not hide anything, so when we came from Sacramento to come see the car, it was exactly as described!. When we decided to purchase the car he actually got us a better loan than what our bank had pre qualified us for. The car was so perfect we entered it into a Corvette show the following weekend and we took second place!
Thank you Samson! If anyone wants to see the car check it out on YouTube search for the Corvette Channel.</text>

< review>
My trip to United Importe was short and uneventful. I test drove a 2016 X5. Was relatively interested but the car was way over priced for a vehicle that had previous electrical issues stated by CarFax (this was a hybrid). Before I could even finish reading the bill of sale he proceeded to tell me how they have a NO NEGOTIATION policy.

I immediately walked out, a dealership that doesn’t negotiate is flat out bad business. They may have nice cars in their showroom but no substance under the hood.

2 hours later I purchased the same car with more bells and whistles for a fair price at S&R motors in Hayward. Paid $30K cash that could’ve gone to United Imports instead.<//review>

United Imports has the largest selection of top quality used luxury cars with competitive prices. They were firm on their sale price but after reviewing on car guru my car was listed as a great deal. Keep in mind when you go to the car lot it’s only a portion of the cars available. They have a huge warehouse and several different lots full of beautiful cars.

<Rate>5</Rate><name>Aminta Mickles</name><review>A true blessing-
I received immediate help, answers to my questions and a great experience. I came in to look at a Jaguar however, after asking many questions, I left with a clean Mercedes. It was a great experience for my daughter and I together. She previously purchased a car somewhere else and the experience was not the same. She said “I wish I would have known about United Motors before. My next car I will buy here as well.”
Jerry V was very patient, answered all of our questions and  I test drove several cars. I like the no haggling and the ability to do the paperwork quickly. Cash and Drive was excellent for me. A true blessing!
Thank you Lord and and thank you United Imports.< /review></record></dataset><record>

So I am re-vising my previous 5 star to 1 star!!! They charged me $550 for DMV fees and the DMV fees only came up to $336 for transfer title The Whole Nine Yards, do you think I ever got a refund of the difference? Nope! I've called the dealership over two dozen times to constantly be given the runaround or an excuse with no call back and no refund!!! Now I'm going to have to file a complaint through DMV and if I want back that money I have to take them to small claims court 😠😠😠😠</text>

Would never go back there! Super unprofessional and rude! Two sales representatives got into argument right in front of us, fighting for ten minutes deciding who is going to show us the car. We had our test drive appointment scheduled but when we got there, the car was not even ready,- not washed, not polished. Wouldn't negotiate even ten bucks. Stay away!</Review>

Great experience, these guys were great and the team made it very easy for us to purchase our new car (Town and Country). We had two toddlers in tow and not only were they really patient with them but they also fed and watered them as needed (thereby avoiding tantrums which has to be a win win).
Overall, the team were polite, friendly, professional and very helpful (especially with the fact that we had just moved to the US and had no credit rating!). We would definitely go back.</review>

I purchased the vehicle and had to get the oil changed as soon as I got back in town (oil was at 1% when it was sold) and, the 1st salesman advised that the tires were at 69% and that was all that us required and there was no need for a  change. Wrong answer. We had to purchase tires as well...very expensive tires may I add...although we had a preapproval the process took way too long...two days...that don't make since.
If not for the above the dealership would have received 5 stars</text>

Ok an honest review here.
Are these guys shady? No
Are these guys good? Yes
Are these guys perfect? No
The car buying experience wasn't great per say but they try to be good for which I give them credit. At the end of the day they have nice cars at nice prices.
Didn't have a great buying experience but a decent one and ended up buying car from here with no issues.<//review>

I went to United Imports for several reasons and one of the reasons was because I knew I wouldn't be harassed by a sales person.. The sales representative that I worked with at first was amazing,  very patient and had great customer service. Over all I had a great experience with the purchase of my car. I would purchase another car from them and also I would refer my friends to United Imports.<//Text>

<Review>Do not buy your vehicle from this place specially from Joe this is a worst place these people are liars he said on the contract if anything happens to the tire they will take care of it because the tire was losing air now that I have bought the car and took it to the shop to get it fixed and shop told me car need a new tire because there's a nail on the outside of the tire cannot fixed I called and Joe told me he's going to talk to his boss and get back to me had me on hold he never got back  on the phone I'm trying to get in contact with the news channel so I can expose this people and get them shut down for good so  they can stop scamming people this is ridiculous and he filled out our application for the loan wrong putting the long lying on the application just to get us approved I have it on video I recorded him. All the people that have been scammed from this place should try to get in contact with a news channel and Better Business Bureau<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I drove over 30 miles to go to look at the lexus because I need a car and I didn't have anybody to help me not even a single person did ask me what I was doing in the lot.In my mind if you don't have that customer service you will ignore me after my purchase and not even think to ask any question if something is wrong with the car you just purchased .< /text>< pics>

Sandra showed us the car but left us alone to look it over and decide if the vehicle was right for us. She was very helpful in answering all of our questions on the vehicle and Samson showed my husband helpful options on the car.  Their prices are fantastic.  We even received an extra bonus they contacted the previous owner and obtained a second key for us.  I highly recommend United Imports for your used vehicle purchase.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I purchased a 2016 MB E250 from United Imports of San Jose 2 weeks ago. I had a good experience through the sales process and was impressed with the quality of their inventory. The problem I ran into is that they did not process the documentation properly or provide me with the documents that I needed to be able to register the car. I live out of California and drove the car to my home state. United provide a trip permit to allow me to drive out of California, but when I went to get the car registered in my state, our DMV said that documents were missing. I called United several times for help and received promises to look into the issue and call me back.  The callbacks did not happen. They have no direct line to their internal title department, so I could only contact the sales department for assistance. After about 4 days of this treatment, I finally got a call back from their title department. They had mistakenly send all documentation to the CA DMV and could not provide me with the needed documents so I could register the car in my state. They suggested that I call the finance company to see if they had received the title yet. Even though it has been nearly 2 weeks, the paperwork was not processed by United until about a week ago, so the finance company had nothing. I called the CA DMV, and after 2 hours on hold, spoke to an agent who said that they just received and processed the documents yesterday and had sent the title to the finance company. All I can do now is call the finance company every day and once they receive the docs, have them send them to the DMV in my state.Meanwhile, the car sits in the garage, unusable. United made a mistake, but it was their lack of interest or concern about the problem, including not receiving promised call backs, that will keep me from dealing with them again in the future.< /review>

To good to be true. When you look at the inventory of United Imports, you'd be impressed. However, the unprofessional demeanor you get from the sales people and owners is on a different level. I understand they're angry because the car business isn't as lucrative as people think it is. They don't make that much money to begin with. because of this, they're very impulsive. The cars are shinny but broken. Check the specs. These cars are high maintenance. That means, they break down. And when they do break down, the 30k car loan you got is going up. Personal finance people. Check the car trade in value. They'll sell you a car that depreciates real quick.< /review>

Can buy good car here, but make sure you come here at morning which you can check all details like scratch of the car，because the dealer won't tells you about it，even they knows. They will gives you the carfax report of the car，but when little things happen to the car，not serious enough to goes on the carfax，they will hide it，until you figure out yourself.< /review>

Horrible service, they won't do a thing for you in negotiation or on interest rates. They regard checked my credit without asking and got my approved for a loan with a horrible interest rate because they only go through like 2 banks. They WILL NOT ship cars for you. Horrible customer service. Only buy a car from these guys if you're in love with the car. Otherwise shop elsewhere!<//text>

I drove all the way from Las Vegas and purchased a 2016 Mercedes GLC300 from United Imports and my sales person's name is Lopez. He was pretty helpful and I had a overall great experience at the shop, despite having to wait here and there.

As I was driving home I noticed some weird noise coming from under the hood when I turn left or right. So I went to my local mercedes dealership and they found out the battery holder is completely MISSING! Also, the battery is not the correct size. I got a $750 quote from them to get it fixed. - new battery, battery holder and nuts. The mechanic also told me that he would not expect a reputed dealership to sell a car like this, since an undersized battery could cause potential electrical issues and alternator problems.

I understand the dealership had a sold as-is policy, but I was also handed a sheet that states the car has passed 21 inspections, which clearly include checking battery, cables, and terminals. This issue indicates the inspections was either not done at all, or not done properly.

The past few days I have been trying to call the shop but for the most time I couldn't get someone to answer. I texted the person who sold me the car but haven't got a response. Finally got my call answered and spoke to another sales person and he told me if I was in San Jose still he could swap out the battery for free. That was not a realistic option for me as I already drove back home. Then he told me to speak to manager Issac, I called his desk, left a voicemail but have not yet received a response.

I may update this review if someone follows up with me and come up with a solution. Otherwise I will leave it as a 2-star based on my poor post-sale experience.</Review>

After 10 beautiful years with my 2005 Hyundai Tucson SUV (which I called My Silver Lining),  it was time to say goodbye. Getting a new car now was like getting a puppy before putting the family dog down.  It was an awkward,  uncomfortable and frightening experience to approach.  I knew it was time so I threw my email and cell phone number to the wind (all willy-nilly), fruitlessly hoping the calls would pour in and drown out the sound of uncertainty.  I scoured Car Gurus and believed in the possibility that I would not just get a FAIR or a GOOD deal, but a GREAT deal.  I believed. After being "catfished" by multiple cars,  I found the GREAT deal I was looking for, right down the street.  Horacio Lopez showed me the car that intrigued me,  let me drive it an AMPLE amount,  encouraged me and guided me onto the freeway so I could really let it prove itself,  then patiently and skillfully crunched numbers till the deal I got was better than I'd even hoped or dreamed.  I went in there with nothing but my autograph, and I came outta there with the car of my dreams,  a killer warranty, hope for the future and a best friend that will be there for me in pinch for at least another 10 good years.  Bravo,  Horacio! I'm naming my new car after you.< /review>

Always you find great deal I was bit worry after all the negative review but I figur I will give them a try I look up online the car I want they have very friendly website btw :)
And call to make sure they have it in stock I make an appointment with Sandra. I walk in she smile and grab the key for the car and we went out to see the car I was impressed the car was in great condition clean car fax of course I didn’t expect the car to be 100% brand new because the end of the day it’s lease return so it’s use car just to remind all this guy with bad review for little thing :)
In few hours I was out with the car super clean and shiny
Thanks guys it’s was my pleasure and definitely will buy here my next car
Highly recommend</Review>

United Imports is definitely the place you want to go if you want a luxurious and good priced car, steve not only maid my experience great but he helped us get the car we wanted, unlike other dealerships he helped us get the best rate and prices with very low downpayment. If you guys want a car that stands out from the res united Imports is where you want to go.</Review>

<review>Prices are tempting but don't fall for it. You'll save yourself some money going to a more reputable dealer in the long run. They sold me a car knowing it had a key missing, a TPMS missing, bad brake pads, etc. Was considering legal action, however they fixed the tpms issue and brake pads no cost.

Don’t buy car from them . I know they’re cheap but the cars no good I bought my car from them it was good price and low miles. But after I month I have change the tires on car the next month the car need breaks after 4th month the shocks was no good. So in 1 yr I have spend lots of money in the car. B4 anyone buy from them plzzzzzz check the car from some like car dealers or who knows about cars..... think twice b4 Buying From THEM......I’m not happy with my car...<//Review>

< Review>
This is the most unprofessional dealership I have ever been to. They are the perfect example of bait and switch. They don't have the car they advertise on web sites but they will confirm it over the phone that the car is available. We ended buying  older model Audi A7 (2016) from them then the one advertised and I been really regretting that decision. The car was delivered dirty to us, the reason they gave was because the city does not allow water cleaning. The sales man Samson showed us 2 sets of keys at the time of sale but only delivered one set, stating the battery was low on the other set he will replace and mail it to us. It's been months now, no key were delivered and the Samson (sales person) won't even take my call. The car has other maintenance issues besides passenger side window not closing.
I was warned by my friend about this dealership but I was so fixated on the car that I ignored his warnings about the dealership.< /Review>

Bought my first car from them. Friendly, and a couple months later they fixed a part of the interior that was broken when I bought the car. Excellent service.< /Review>

Called up before going and the saleswoman, Sandra, confirmed that the car I was looking for is still available. When I reached the showroom, Sandra tells me that the car I am looking for has already been sold. Apparently she did not hear it right on the phone. Anyway, I ask her if she has another car with the same configuration in my price range, she says she does. So, she leads us out to the parking lots, spends the next 15 minutes making us walk from one lot to the other, apparently "searching" for the car. She comes back and tells us can't find the car or the keys. Apparently, they have another lot across the street. So, she has the audacity to tell us, to walk over to that lot and search for the car ourselves and call her "if" we find the car. And she walks away. I tell her, she did not give us her number to call us!! And begrudgingly, after making us wait for another 10 mins, she scribbles her number on a post it and hands it to us. Never coming back. They are totally unprofessional and probably lie about the car specs too!<//text>

Low price, huge inventory. They are specializing premium - brand imported cars, especially Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Maserati. If they have other brands, I didn't notice. Since they play with volume, the price is low, and their service is professional, but not less individualized... you go there after you decide what to buy, not just in terms of brand or model, but a few specific items they have.<//review>

< review>
Great buying experience.

First off, I must say that I was skeptical because I tend to read the lowest reviews first.  Rolling back the odometer, misrepresenting Carfax reports and heavy-handed financing were my concern as I had looked over the BBB website complaints for United Imports of San Jose.

Samson Hague, the operations manager who handled my buying experience, was honest about the past issues after I had brought up my concerns.  I believe there were some misunderstandings from customers in the past.  Samson was very patient and polite, not at all aggressive or temperamental.  He is a delight to negotiate with.

I had brought with me a printed out copy of the free Carfax report of the car which I was interested in and he went to the Carfax website and immediately printed out the full report.  We both signed each page of the Carfax report saying that everything is accurate and true in the report (as reported by Carfax) has not been modified by any employee or staff of United Imports of San Jose.

After buying the car, I took it to my mechanic and everything checked out in the car and everything is as represented by Samson.

United Imports sold me my car for about $9000 less (30%+less) then a certified pre-owned vehicle of the same spec and mileage.  When I took the car home I did have to update the software in the car and will have to do some things that the dealer would normally do on a certified pre-owned vehicle.  The front tires will need replacing in about 7,000 miles, rear brakes in about 6,000 miles.  Somewhere in the neighborhood of $800 to fix/replace.  Not bad.

Basically, from my understanding, they buy most cars at auction as lease turn ins.  They detail the exterior, detail the interior, but leave the motor and undercarriage  original, which is good so you can see if fluids are leaking or not.  Certified and other  dealers clean everything so you don't know if the power steering pump dribbles
a bit or if the engine oil pan gasket seeps.  I liked the fact I could see the normal road dirt and not a single leak or speck of engine fluid.

This is as close as you can get to buying a car at auction yourself without having an auction license.  Wholesale plus a few hundred dollars.  Nice deal.

I did have to haggle on the interest to get it to where I felt it should be for my loan.  That is really the only place you can haggle, as the price for the car is fixed as the cars are much less expensive than certified pre-owned or other dealers.

All in all, I am totally satisfied with United Importers.  I went in with big time doubts, left happy but somewhat weary, (didn't get the car pre-checked) and after my independent service guy went over the car and told me it's all good, happy as a clam.

I'd recommend United Imports to anyone, whole heartedly.  Make sure you do your homework on the car first, as you should do with any used vehicle.  You will not be disappointed in the price you get from them, and you will wake up the next day thinking of how much money you saved by buying a car from them.< /review>

They continuously go above and beyond to make sure all my businesses are up to date with insurance policies. They are also very detail oriented, which makes my life easier. I get a ton of phone calls and sometimes miss their calls but they are diligent to make sure they get a hold of me to make sure my employees are employed. They shop around also to ensure I am receiving the best rate. I can't think of a better company I would want to work with for all my insurance needs.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Sarb, my agent, has always treated me with respect, professionalism, and courtesy. Even after working with him for so long his tone and ambition to help me is the same as it was when he first met me. I am somebody with them and not just a commission or number. Not only is Sarb wonderful, but the whole All Solutions Team has treated me with respect, courtesy, and professionalism. They go above and beyond to get you the best deals for your insurance needs. I am glad Sarb called me to get me an insurance quote.  I am definitely this company's long time customer. These guys have not low balled or charged me outrageous prices like other agencies do. All Solutions Insurance is a one stop shop for all your insurance needs, and I highly recommend their services. If you are looking for trucking insurance, get in touch with Sarb and he will gladly help you. Sometimes I needed to call Sarb multiple times to get some issues straightened out, and no matter how many times i called him in a day, Sarb never showed aggitation or resentment in his tone. I always heard a smile through the phone. Thank you to the All Insurance Solutions team for all your hardwork, dedication, and professionalism in helping me with my insurance needs.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

its not often that one finds good insurance for a successful company and on that note it is very hard to find a good agent. All Solutions stands out for its great selection of policy coverage choices. There service team is great. I have been dealing with Ericka Gonzalez for some time now and by far she has surpassed the meaning of excellent customer service she has been very attentive to all my needs and has taken care of everything in a timely manner. Keep up the work All Solutions!!!!!!!!  :)< /Text>

They took the time to educate me about the entire process, explained all available options and even advised me on what I need and don't need; instead of just selling me a policy that I didn't understand.
They did all the work of comparison shopping for me and presented the comparison spreadsheet with backup documents, so I just had to pick their recommendation and go with it saving more than $400. Best of all, no pressure selling or marketing gimmicks whatsoever! Totally hassle free and fun experience. Thank you for saving me money on Auto Insurance, Life Insurance & Renters Insurance.

PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GET INSURANCE!!! I AM A RELIGIOUS PERSON AND USUALLY DO NOT WIRTE ANY REVIEWS. BUT I HAD TO FOR OTHERS. THEY MIGHT GIVE YOU LOWER INSURANCE RATE, BUT THEY TRY TO TRICK YOU WITH FAKE PAPERWORK. THEY TRAPPED ME AND DID NOT GIVE ME ANY MONEY WHEN THERE WAS ACCIDENT. THEY ARE SOME INDIAN PEOPLE GREEDY, IMMORAL PEOPLE.</Review>

I have a business insurance in this company I'm very disappointed I have a auto repair and I was looking  for insurance  I spoke to  the agent he explained this is the cover you need for the business you have, I remember telling me,  this package has this if you or one of you employees  working on a car doing an oil change for example and forget to tighten drain plug on a bmw or mercedes losses oil and damage the engine  don't worry we paid for it, and guess what it happens to me no a bmw or mercedes  but a chevy monte carlo  replace and engine  and forget to tightening the oil pressure switch and the engine was damage  call them  they did not paid a single cent, they will find the way to not paid so I changing to a new insurance  and I will record on my phone every they said, saved and hope never have to needed< /Review>

We came across Seven Seas on our walk through the farmer’s market in Little Italy. We loved their peanut butter cold brew. I had their drip, a medium/dark roast (El Jaguar) which was very smooth! The staff were very friendly as well! If we lived here, we’d be regulars!</text>

<text>One of my favorites in San Diego! Lovely neighborhood spot with super friendly staff. Drinks are always fantastic from a curated menu. Vegans won't be left out with full and equal amounts of options! Pastries provided by local artisans and now bagels from Nomad!

Beans to go always and plenty of rad merch! Be sure to add this to your coffee list if you haven't already been!<//text>< pics>

<Text>This is by far one of my favorite coffee shops in the city. They have two locations, one in Richmond district and the other in the sunset district. All the workers here are always so friendly and super sweet! My favorite drink on their menu is the holy cow which is espresso shots with condensed milk! YUMMS! they also offer a variety of lattes with art on them. Would definitely come back to try their toast selections !<//Text><GmapID>0x80d955696e58f16f:0x5d75abef5814d99e<//GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics><rate>4< /rate><name>Johanna Woods< /name><resp>None</resp>< user>

Lovely cafe in South Park to stop in for coffee. The iced vanilla latte and iced mocha were both delicious. I also tried a couple of their vegan donut bites and was very impressed - they were very flavorful! Good coffee and good vibes.< /review>

I have so many good things to say about Seven Seas!

1. The coffee is great! My go-to is a dirty chai with oat milk. There's plenty of options when it comes to flavors, milk subs, etc.

2. The beans are roasted in-house; you can also buy bags there or order them online (the order online option really got us through a huge chunk of quarantine).

3. The baristas are awesome! Super welcoming, remember our names, remember our orders, and genuinely get to know the customers. They are also well-informed on coffee and offer suggestions if you aren't sure what to order.

4. Awesome atmosphere! South Park is great, and Seven Seas is right in the heart of it. The interior of the shop is cool too - check out the fish tank and custom art (when we can one day go inside again)! I love the garage-door style front.

5. This is one of my favorite things: they clearly have a great relationship and sense of community with the surrounding local businesses. They've gotten T-shirt designs done by the tattoo artists next door at Left Hand Black. They regularly set up at local farmers markets. There's often a local restaurant pop-up outside the shop on Sundays (sometimes other days too. They often have sweets from local bakeries like Matteo for sale. And during this weird time in 2020, they've offered the area in front of the shop to neighboring restaurant Piacere Mio for extra outdoor seating space during the evening.

Bonus: you can't come to Seven Seas without running into a cute dog, or several (and there's always a welcoming bowl of water out if you want to bring your pup too)!< /Text>

I encountered Seven Seas Roasting at a farmer's market in San Diego, and became hooked! They not only had great coffee, but a great mission and a great story. Being in the Navy myself, I of course am drawn towards veterans who have a mission to make positive changes (and delicious coffee). They're a great company, with a great product. They make it easy to purchase from them and feel good about it. Thank you again!< /text>

A coffee connoisseurs' Mecca. Many years in the making, Seven Seas has launched a perfectly executed custom roastery that highlights the finest in directly-sourced one-of-a-kind beans from boutique growers. Seven Seas does honor to the farmer and the bean by applying a scientific approach to extracting the very best flavors and qualities a coffee has to offer. Love the art, science, and passion of coffee? This is a must-experience place.<//review>

It's not just great coffee from all over the world, but it is! It's not just really cool people doing really cool work, but they are! It's not just a company committed to touching the lives of all of the hands involved in growing, cultivating and bringing their product to market, but they are.  It's not just a company that gives back in it's own community,making a difference in lives right in their backyard, but they do.  So when you find a company that does all those things intentionally, on purpose… well, that's a company worth supporting. Try their coffee. You're welcome.</text>

The only thing that I’m not impressed by is the customer service. The first time I went in there I told the barista that it was my first time and she just looked straight at me. No conversation, no suggestions, nothing, just awkard silence.  The second time, it was better another barista was a little more welcoming. Today, I went there and the barista was not friendly, no eye contact, no convo, nothing. He forgot my order until he saw that I was waiting for it.  He made it and just put it on the counter top.
This place has so much potential but they really need to get baristas that are friendly and welcoming.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Guadalupe Manjarrez< /username>< Date>

<Review>I usually don't write reviews but I feel like my experience should be known. This my first time coming into Seven Seas, I first order two black coffee's and the lady at the front asked what kind of coffee that I wanted. Pointing at the three types they had which is fine glad she asked, when I told her which one of those I wanted. She then picked up the bag and the I repeated saying TWO CUPS, then I ordered a iced mocha coffee . I was handed the two black coffee's and the mocha which I am 100% certain it was just mainly milk and no mocha. I am annoyed that I payed $5 for an ice coffee with barely any coffee and mostly milk and no mocha. It was difficult to understand what the lady at the register was saying, but if you plan on being in customer service, I think it's best to take classes to improve your english so there is no miscommunication between you and the customer! Also who ever is the barista is very unprofessional and easily distracted. The coffee is not bad it is the customer service was horrible, I will go else where for coffee.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Seven Seas does coffee and business like no one before. Traceable, transparent, and directly traded with their farmers. They work with women run collectives, give back with charity roasts, and everyone on their team is a craftsmen of their art. Their passion comes through in everything they do, even in a simple cup of joe.

My fav roasts are the single origin from Laos, Phoumako; the Peruvian, and the Guatamala Gold.</Text>

I took in a completely damaged key and a replacement that I bought online that only needed to get programmed (I thought). Well... the replacement did not work and Jose took the time to explain to me how chipped keys are designed and how they operate internally. Further, he was able to assemble one out of spare parts he had. I definitely recommend this locksmith. Again, the employee who helped me was Jose, a true professional... excellent customer service (visited 07/03/2020).<//review></record></dataset><record>

I called them and they came with in 30 minutes. We lost our key for our car and Jose had a key made for us right away. Took him about 15 minutes at the max. He was even nice enough to help jump start the car and move it (stick shift) in our drive way before the street sweeper came. Would recommend them for sure.< /text>

I had problems with both my ignition and door not working. They gave me the problem breakdown, the price quote for both, and the ETA in one phone call. They came when they said they would and fixed my ignition within 2hrs (longer bc my car wouldn't start). Price was very reasonable.They jump started my car, opened my door, and came to my location free of charge! When here, I ended up needing additional work on door and didn't fix that, but super grateful for what I got done. Would reccomend all the way!!! Thank you Phill's Locksmith! God bless you all.<//review>

<Date>1582092364548<//Date><username>Dulce<//username><review>If you need any help with your car locks or car keys, this is the place to go. The battery holder in my key broke  and I couldn’t get into my car. I called and spoke with Jose. I informed him of my situation and he notified me on my options. He was very informative and he’s also a very honest man.  He let me know that he could fix the part, but there will still be a chance that it might not work, and I would still wound up paying. I ended buying a brand new key from him. I loved his customer service since the moment I spoke to him on the phone, and once again, how honest he was. I know I’ll definitely be going back to his shop for any further work.
Thank you Jose!!<//review>< gmap_id>

We needed to rekey some locks in our house, So after speaking with a couple different locksmiths we decided to go with Phills Locksmith becouse they sounded very knowledgeable over the phone. We were not disappointed, they did an excellent job at a fair price. Now I have a locksmith that I can trust.  Will definitely recommend to friends and family.   Thanks<//Text>

I recommend Phill's locksmith to everyone. JOSE came through and was able to cut the key for my Mazda pick-up. Jose was friendly, clean and took less than 10 minutes to make a fresh key. He gave me his card so I'll be calling Phill's if I need locksmith service.<//Text>

My car ignition got stuck, so I called around looking for a good locksmith who I could trust with my job. On the phone they were very polite and sounded professional, so I hired them.I am glad I did. They took care of my problem in no time and the price was fair. Will definitely call them again if I ever need them. Thank you.<//Review>

First time using this locksmith & it was such a great experience. Very honest & reasonable prices !
The steering wheel on my Acura TL Type S locked & no matter what I tried it would not unlock. Called , they sent a locks man by the name of Jose & he was super friendly & fixed the problem right away. Thank you!< /review>

So, on Saturday night, somebody tried to steal my car, luckily they didn't take it, but the broke the key inside the ignition switch. So, I call a friend to help me try to take it out, but we couldn't.  So I had to wait until Monday to find someone to do it.  I checked on goggle maps and try to find a locksmith.  I called 5 different locations and I couldn't get the help I needed. So then I find Phill's Locksmith, called them up and they got me quick help at a very good price. 15 minutes later, one of their specialist name Jose comes and takes the ignition switch off in a jiffy and my car was good to go. This is the best service to get, so if you need some help, ask for Jose. Thank you for all your help, I appreciate it</text>

good customer service, and was fast, to send someone to our place of business. The time that they took to help us open our locks was withing 5-10min. The time it took for the locksmith to arrive to our business after calling them was 10min. Really recommend their service.</text>

<text>I locked myself out of my home on a Staurday afternoon. I called multiple locksmiths in the area, and they were either not available or couldn't service homes. Fortunately I found Phill's Locksmith Service. Jose was very polite on the phone, they sent out Manuel.
Manuel showed up promptly, was very professional. Manuel was very polite and assured me he would be able to open the lock. He unlocked it quicker than I could have imagined. The price was reasonable. I would definitely recommend them to friends.</text>< Name>

I called 3 other places and they said they did not have the Ignition cylinder for my 2016 Silverado. Until I called Phill Locksmith, they had the part in stock. Very knowledgeable and professionals, within an hour they had already completed the job. Will definitely recommend to my friends and  Family.  Thank you.</review>

Lost my keys while doing laundry.
I called all around and finally found this great place!
As soon as they answered they were very understanding and knew exactly what they were doing.
By the time I got back to my locked out car, Miguel was already finished. Very fast, friendly and reliable! I will definitely be going to them first in the future.< /text>

It is never a happy time to have to call a locksmith. However, I'm glad I called. Jose showed diligency and efficiency. He was able to create a copy of the key after losing the original, all at a low price.</Text>

Great customer service, reasonable prices and fast service. I lost the keys to my home so I called them up. They sent one of their guys over and I had a replacement key made on the spot! The whole process from when I made the call to finish 30 minutes.< /review>

After locking my wallet in my 4Runner's glove box, I tried the key to open it back up again. Stuck!!

Googled "locksmiths near me" and a range of them popped up. I chose Phill's based on reviews.

They were professional, quick and courteous. Best yet, they found a solution to my problem. Couldn't be happier. Thanks Phill's, you're the best!!!</Text>

<Text>Manuel was awesome! He came to unlock a closet door. The lock is a good lock that is not easily open by picking the lock but he resured me that one way or another he would get it open. Well without having to drill, he was able to open it. They are honest with their prices and they are quick to attend to you.<//Text>< pics>

When it comes to renting a storage unit, U-Haul San Clemente is by far the best local option for multiple reasons:

- Lowest cost option in the area
- Very kind and helpful staff
- Extremely clean facility
- Family owned and operated for decades
- Camera security monitoring 24 hrs a day with owners living on premises< /Review>

You’d think when you reserve a truck 3 weeks in advance they’d have it right?

No. The day before our move U-Haul SC called to tell us our 26 foot truck wasn’t there. No explanation was given. We got passed around to various employees and the only solution they gave was to give us a 10 foot truck which obviously did not work for us.

After many phone calls to their various departments we arranged to go pick up a truck in Oceanside (our idea since they had no solution) - 60 miles round trip. Of course we had to repeat our saga to every employee. We asked them to give us extra mileage since this was entirely their fault, which of course was not noted so we had to argue about it a second time.

They suggested that we go to Oceanside, get the truck, park it at our San Clemente condo overnight, and just use it in the morning. As if a 26 foot truck would just neatly fit in a parking spot...

The San Clemente Uhaul employees were rude and unhelpful. It doesn’t seem like any of them had the ability to problem solve.

I will never ever recommend this place to anyone. They refused to refund us any amount and it was absolutely one of the worst customer service experiences I’ve ever had.

The worst part was that the employees just refused to find a solution.</review>

Got a call just now saying that my truck won’t be available at the location 5 mins from my house, but a location over an hour away.  Also, that location doesn’t have the trailer I reserved. The trailer is at...you guessed it...another location.  I asked for 20$ off that wouldn’t even cover the extra gas to drive it an hour back to my house, and the rep says no way.  I’m hoping Uber has some version of Uber-move coming soon so uhaul will learn the hard lesson other industries have had to learn.

If you're looking for a U-Haul with very poor service, well then this is your place.  A lady answered the phone with zero greeting or even stating her name. To top if off, and about 30 seconds into the conversation she says "please old" and before I could even respond she put me on hold for 11 minutes............  Extremely rude service and would not recommend to anyone.  Try the U-Haul in San Juan Capistrano or Laguna Niguel as they represent U-Haul properly</review>

That being said, this place cracks me up. I’ve never run into employees so disorganized and careless. We had to clarify and double check all their work, doing everything short of literally holding their hand due to the number of errors on their part.

Save yourself the headache and take your business to the San Juan location.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is the third time I’ve gone to U-Haul to simply ask for a 5 x 8 trailer.   I can never get a straightforward answer from any of the employees about reserving a  trailer to get up to Montana from Southern California. All they ever tell me is it’s either local use only or they don’t have any available.  It is always difficult to rent anything from U-Haul. What is the purpose of having a moving company if you’re not going to let your customers use your trailers to move out of state? The lady that helped me was very kind but I’ve never been turned down this many times from U-Haul.< /text>< pics>

I have rented  space and trucks for well over 20 years, it was mandatory for the work I was doing

This staff has earned my eternal gratitude and my respect, there are a significant number of details, Safty protocols and liability issues that we customers know little to nothing about.

They showed my family and me every courtesy and consideration as I lost keys, cards, locks!! I did my best to juggle 4 units, three trucks, 7 movers,ect ect when my patience ran out they had solutions that made the day.

They have my vote!! And they have earned it!</Text>

<Review>We camp a lot at San Clemente State Park Beach.

Finding propane filling centers is a challenge. This U-Haul is one.

I arrived over this morning to fill my small 1 gallon  tank. Their equipment was down for repair. The man took my number and promised to call me later in the day when  they were back in business. I never thought he would. But he did. What about that for service.

And by the look of the line up when I returned I wasn't the only guy he called.

Service like this needs to be acknowledged and rewarded.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I can't say enough positive things about this Uhaul location.  Cindy and her team saved me.  I'd made a reservation at the Oceanside Uhaul for a car dolly. When I arrived they did not have the dolly I had reserved and tried to 'upgrade' me to a auto transport.  Unfortunately the auto transport was 2000 lbs and put my vehicle over maximum towing weight with the car.  Trying to talk me into taking the auto transport the girl in Oceanside told me that was my only option and it was ONLY 150 lbs overweight; and unless I wanted to wait until the next day and drive 2 hours the opposite direction to El Cajon or Alpine (4 hours) it was my only option.  Her co-worker, seeing she was being very difficult, pulled me over to her desk and tried to help me find something.  She sent me up to Cindy in San Clemente.   Cindy did not have a dolly available but did some rearranging and allowed me to rent her tow dolly, 5 minutes before closing. I know this means she lost over $300 but she was willing to go above and beyond to help a customer that had been wronged and left stranded by the other Uhaul and I am very grateful.</text>

<text>Old lady at the desk was blah. Not good or bad. Never smiled. Older man checking out truck never smiled once either. When i returned the truck there was a younger guy checking it in and was pleasent and took care of us fast. Very hard to get in and out from freeway because of street access</text>< pics>

<text>Use caution.  I booked a trailer over the phone, and the person added furniture pads to my order without my knowledge or consent.  I assume it was to add a few extra bucks to the order.

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Great place in the morning. But no restrooms plus the center connect has a version of CMC clinic but still no public restrooms. A few grills but this is the place that whom ever designed it needed new glasses or retired the canopy type cover do not cover the benches only just before dark... What about the day when it it hot. No trees near the tabled benches. But still a great place in the morning.</text>< Pictures>

This park in Stockton is a very significant childhood location where I would play at. I enjoyed the small environment and the playground which was relatively big. The park is also easy to locate and accessible to everyone. I would recommend this park for anything including family picnics or just bringing children to the park.</Text>

The land area is huge, there's plenty of benchs, there's  a barbecue area, there's  two structures, one for younger children and one for the oldder. And they also have a basketball court, an enormous basketball court it has six nets. I love this park because it's so neat. You can see  from the start that  is clean. But also you'll  see the employees at least  once  a week. Excellent park!!!!!!!</Review>< username>

<username>Amanda Moore</username><Text>I took my German Shepard in because he has something going on with his eye. This was his first time there and I loved them. They were very good with my dog and complemented him on being such a good boy! They gave me a prompt diagnosis and what the next steps were. I was nervous about cost of the visit and medicine because I have heard horror stories of costly vets. But they have very reasonable prices so that eased my mind and this will be my dogs forever hospital from now on!< /Text>< user_id>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>We live in Glendora but have been making the 20 minute drive to see Dr. Mintzer and his staff since 2007 when we got our first dog. The doctor, Cornell educated, has endless experience. Not only does he love his craft but he also cares about his patients. He is accurate with his diagnoses every time, and he offers options to reduce cost when possible. In 2015 one of our Rotties had a toe amputation -- surgery done there -- due to cancer. To stabilize his leg, Dr. Minzer and his partner/surgeon, Dr. Beaglie designed a special "shoe" of sorts for my pup. It was a priceless act which was helpful and highly appreciated. It's acts like that which will keep us faithful customers.< /Review>< pictures>

This was our first time here. This was needed care following an emergency surgery for our Golden Retriever.

Staff is excellent here. After you leave your precious pet with them they call you with updates.

They are quick to return calls if you have any questions. From the receptionist, to the nurse, to the Dr. All are very receptive and caring.

After speaking with the Dr over the phone I was left at ease knowing that my dog is in good care. He explained my dog’s condition to me well and was patient with my questions. My wife could hear his voice as we were speaking and she commented to me, just by they way he spoke to me set her at ease as well.

Unfortunately, my yard has a tick problem due to, I presume, Farrell cats, possums, mice, skunks, etc...
Many times we feel extremely apprehensive(embarrassed)when we have to bring our dog in anywhere to be seen as we have been treated as if we neglect him or are just plain dirty...not.
This was not the case in any way here!
The Dr noted the ticks with me and was completely understanding and afforded me great advice. Something as simple as brushing. But he took the time to educate me more in order to help us.
He and The staff recommended a new treatment that i have not tried...The mainstream over the counter treatment does not work!

They give good advise on caring for your pet after the healing process and continue with follow up until the healing is complete.

Cost seemed very good compared to our normal vets pricing for the same care.

Very pleased with them and confident that I can call them anytime should a need arise...thank you</Text>

I brought me dog to have her ears cleaned due to an infection. They charged me almost $500. Had to bring her back in a week to have medication applied.,and was told they want to charge me again to clean her ears out. Unbelievable quality of workmanship, reliability and value. Beware and forewarned on bringing your loved ones here!!!
I would have given 0 stars but that was not an option.</text>

I've been taking my pup here for years. The staff is very caring, considerate and makes me feel at ease. They've helped me understand and taken care of my dog's teeth, digestive issues, shots, grooming, and Allergy problems. I trust the Vets and the team here when I leave my pup in their hands.<//review>

I have been bringing my dogs to All Pets Medical for the past 3 1/2 years for a reason; quality of service and compassionate care. The staff is always professional and respectful. Dr. Mintzer is professional and really knowledgeable on the newest technologies of veterinary medicine. I wouldn't trust my pets to anyone else.< /review>

My cat was very very ill and I have been desperately looking for specialists who can see him but all of the VCAs and bigger hospitals were full for weeks to months. But when I called APMSC they had a spot for the following morning!

So prior to this, I went to a VCA and they were so unhelpful in giving direction to take (aside from what it seemed was money gouging me). But the instant Dr. Mintzer saw my kitty, he listed several possibilities that would cause him to be ill and he recommended the appropriate measures and explained why each would help rule out possible illnesses.

After the visit, Dr. Mintzer and his staff have been so prompt with my follow ups and any concerns I had. And everyone was so pleasant and patient (I felt like every time my cat showed any sort of symptoms, I would call). They're super understanding and wonderful - I would recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I have been taking my pet here for the last year. I was very happy with the care he was receiving.  I called again to get a refill and , my fault waited until I ran out of his pills, so I asked if I could get his refill.  They said they could not refill, until they do another office visit, so I asked if I could just get 5 pills just to hold us over.  I got no call or any care for our boy.  It was Was very disheartening.< /text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>The facility is clean and most of the staff is friendly. They have always treated my dogs well; however, they are over-priced.  They offer "discounts" only if you pay more for another procedure, medication, etc. The pricing is quite subjective and manipulative. You have to be on your toes. My cat's estimate to remove 2 teeth was $400 then jumped to $800 six months later because all their clinic costs had "doubled" overnight. (Hard to believe). A vet in Rowland Heights did it for $240. At times it feels the doctors are more interested in making as much profit as possible. It's disappointing.  had a dental cleaning estimate for over $1,000 and when I refused it,  the person who writes up the estimates ripped it up in front of me and threw it in the trash which seemed a little dramatic. I still try to negotiate. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't.< /review>< Pics>

<rating>1</rating><Text>It’s hard to read the positive reviews and make sense of why our experience was so horrible with the Doctors. It must be the excellent staff that upped these ratings.  But unfortunately the staff doesn’t diagnose the pets.  I  have taken two different pets there (I am of a full time caretaker of one) and all four visits I left so upset and lacking any answers, but left feeling belittled and upset. My last visit I  asked my dad to come for some support, and he also complained that the Dr was rude.  Dr said to me things like “well she is old, she probably isn’t going to live much longer,”  “what don’t you understand, its straightforward”, “you’re not listening to me”.  I had one pet have a severe allergic reaction to a medication that was prescribed for pneumonia. Unfortunately I didn’t realize until later that both medications I was prescribed to give my pet were not supposed to be prescribed together or allergic reaction will happen!!!!!
Then I had to call over the weekend to get help from the wonderful office staff.  They were so much help. But the Doctor follows up the next day to see how my dog is doing, and he belittled me over the phone.  Talk about insult to injury.

I WILL SAY.....if I could rate the front desk staff and the Vet Tech’s I would give a 5 star rating. In fact I feel if it weren’t for their kindness, I wouldn’t have stuck out all the belittling from the Doctors. I wish I could take that entire staff along with me to a new vet.<//Text>< Pics>

Nothing but a great experience every time I take my fur baby. They’re incredibly compassionate and always helping in the best possible way for my animal. I’m truly thankful for them and would 100% recommend anyone going to them.</text>

They have the best staff of doctors and nurses.
They are Kind, friendly, experienced , caring, loving, professional.
They were able to handle and give complete care to my dog, where he had been turned away from other places.
I completely and highly recommend All Pets Medical and Surgery Center. They groom and board as well as their normal vet services.  They are one of the best I've found.<//Review>

< Review>
On the window, it clearly says, “Pet Adoption.”  Otherwise, I wouldn’t have bothered call their office. When, I, originally, called last week. Adrianna was extremely helpful.  I explained about how I needed to find somewhere for my ex’s dog that is still at my house. I don’t want her to be euthanized because she’s, actually, a good dog. I’m just not a dog person. She explained that she would reach out to the rescue to see if they could help me. She asked me questions about the dog. I even emailed a picture. But when, I called today to follow up. Unfortunately, she was not working. The first woman that answered was courteous and tried to assist. She placed me on hold. Then, a younger woman comes to the phone, and, abruptly, explained that it wasn’t their job. And I should call the humane society or a rescue. She was, unnecessarily, rude for absolutely no reason. I know that the “Pet Adoption” on the window does not mean that you can go to the vet office and pick out a dog to adopt. So, I’m not sure what it means. But if that is not “their job,” they should take the sign down to insure that they will not have to be bothered with these wasteful phone calls like mine!< /Review>

My husband and I have been bringing our cats to "All Pets Medical..." for years.  Dr. Mintzner is our veterinarian, and we have been impressed not only with his diagnostic and treatment recommendations, but also his caring nature.  He is highly competent (and is a Cornell graduate) and spends as much time as we need explaining our cat's medical issues.  Our comments are always valued too.  We also board our diabetic cat here when we go out of town, and he comes home with a shiny coat and a "settled" look.  The two cats that roam the office are just precious, and the staff is attentive and warm.  Highly recommended.< /text>

THANK YOU! Our family is raising a puppy in training for Guide Dogs of America. His vet services are usually handled by GDA. However, he became ill when it was too late to take him to be seen by them. We were driving by at 5:20pm and saw the office- so, we stopped in. The staff was so kind and immediately agreed to see him. He was given a completely thorough exam and best of care (including a shot)  by Dr. B and his staff.... Even  knowing that we would most likely not be able to return in the future. Again, THANK YOU so very much! Our pup is feeling so much better and ready to continue on his journey to become the  "eyes" for a Blind Partner!< /Review>

Took my Boston here a year ago for knee surgery. I got a phone call saying she was in cardiac arrest and i need to get down there soon. Well vet tried to say she might have had a heart condition, but that is not true she had test done prior to being put under. The vet showed no compassion when he came into the room. I took my dog and trusted them with her to be better. Never in a million years did I think I would not go home with my dog. Yes it's taken me a year to write this review do to the pain I have about my dog. Can you believe they wanted their money after they were done with surgery!!! They ended up giving me a discount but I still paid them and didn't go home with my dog. I believe they aren't equipped to handle smashed face dogs and they shouldn't have taken her out the ventilator to soon.  They deserve no stars!!!< /review>

They were magical. I just lost my special angel dog Pandora. She was like the second mom in our home. We've had her since she was 8 wks old and my daughter was 5
My daughter is now 20. Felix the young man who works there and is also a college mate of my daughter told us to bring her in the morning after she passed. The young lady @the front desk I believe Tiffany was her name was heavenly. We were there for cremation. She made sure any discount would apply. She consoled my daughter and I,  who 2 wks later are still crying.  When we picked up Pandora her ashes came with a ceramic paw print a wooden heart with her name on it and two prayers and a package beautiful blue flowers. The idea is you bury the cremation box and plant the flowers over her. They were not money hungry,  they consoles us. I really needed that and I will forever be grateful to Felix & Tiffany 5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.  All of our animals now have a new vet home

<Review>This vet was recommended by someone that works at facility, I couldn’t remember the vet that I have taken my dogs to. This vet made me feel like I was the worst dog owner ever. Prescribed all these meds and said $160 then came back and said oh she needs these to it will be a total of $247. Then I said I couldn’t afford that they gave meds for 3 weeks, why would you do that if you are seeing the dog in a week<//Review>< pics>

My family has been going to see Dr. Beighlie for over 15 years and we have been so pleased with his level of service and knowledge and that of his staff. They truly go above and beyond to help care for all of our fur babies and they understand how pets are part of the family. I highly recommend APMSC to everyone.< /Review>

We have been using All Pets and Dr. Beighlie for over 15 years. They are extremely knowledgeable and professional and they have taken great care of our animals. We feel secure knowing our pets are in their hands. Even after moving some distance away we still take our animals to Dr. Beighlie. I highly recommend All Pets.< /review>

<pics>None</pics><Review>I brought my pets in when they needed vaccines and their annual exams. The staff is very helpful in providing me with answers to all my questions, made me feel like my pets were loved and in very good hands. I also had my Boston terrier spayed here, during the procedure the vey noticed that my dog was almost to the point of needing a pyometria surgery. Without their knowledge of problems that occur with unspayed dogs, I might not have been quickened to get her spayed, saving me a huge bill. Thank you All Pets.<//Review>< rating>

We have been using All Pets and Dr. Beighlie for over 15 years. They are extremely knowledgeable and professional and they have taken great care of our animals. We feel secure knowing our pets are in their hands. Even after moving some distance away we still take our animals to Dr. Beighlie. I highly recommend All Pets.</Text>

We've been taking our pets to All Pets for over 20 years. They care about my pets as much as I do. I wouldn't take my dog to anyone else for medical care and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.</text>

<Text>A number of years ago, my granddaughter moved in with a one year old Shih  Tzu named Scarlet O'Hara. The granddaughter moved out, but couldn't find an apartment that would let her take pets. Scarlet has been with my wife and I now for around 8 years. Dr. Mintzer has been our "go-to" vet for most of her life. Tiffany and Angelica are awesome, as are all of the techs, and I can't say enough about not only the quality of care, but the actual concern to make certain that Scarlet has the best care possible. I am also please with the way paperwork is facilitated with VPI - they keep extra forms in the file, and take care of submitting claims directly to my insurance company. I appreciate that they have an arrangement with the emergency pet hospital down the road so if something happens after hours, I know exactly where to go for quality care. I read some of the reviews, and I have never experienced any unnecessary treatment or billing issues - Scarlet is like a child to my wife and I. I want only the best for Scarlet, and I have it with Dr. Mintzer and his team.< /Text>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><user_id>115392787178374920732<//user_id><Review>We’ve been taking our now 15 y/o American Eskimo to Dr. Beighlie since 2004 after relocating to the area.  Over the years our Eskie has battled a number of physical and medical issues which have been managed effectively by Dr. Beighlie and his treatment team. Having the utmost confidence in the veterinary services provided by the professionals at All Pets, the newest addition to the family, our American Eskimo puppy, has also become a patient. Services are rendered in a thoughtful, sensitive and competent manner from the friendly faces of Angelica and Tiffany at the front desk to all the vet techs who deliver supportive ancillary services. Finally, Dr. Beighlie has demonstrated a strong commitment, dedication and level of competence in ensuring  that one’s pet receives the best care and treatment possible.

<user_id>111762117523646964779<//user_id><review>I would like to say how impressed my family and I were with, All Pets Medical & Surgical Center in Phillips Ranch,Ca.  We have had many pets through the years and in the course of time, been to quite a few veterinary offices.  This was our first time visiting their office.  The minute we walked in the office staff made us feel so welcome. Our dog, Jakes was very sick and we were very nervous and concerned for him.  The staff was so courteous and had us seen right away by Dr. Mintzer.  We were obviously very upset about our dog and he made us feel very comfortable about sharing our concerns.  We could go two different ways with our decision for Jake if you know what i mean. I have to say  what impressed us most, was not just how knowledgeable, Dr. Mintzer was with Jakes health issues, but his kindness and respect to our feelings and letting us make our decision on how we would handle Jakes future.  He truly cared and could see how much we were hurting. He gave us some time alone to to make a very difficult decision...I'm happy to say that we chose to keep Jakes with us for now and through some remarkable treatment he is doing very well.   We are so grateful to Dr. Mintzer for his compassion and for helping us to be able to have some more precious time with our beautiful doggy.  Thank you all so much!!!!!

<Name>Amelia Hoskins< /Name><time>1623532442947<//time><Review>Went out to get groceries and found carts all over the parking lot. There was an employee, tall with curly hair, standing near the entrance just on his cell phone. Normally there are employees outside fetching carts, I go to this Safeway about once per month. This employee ignored me and pointed towards one of three carts. I also had an issue with being overcharged on a club price discount, but customer service dismissed me and told me to wait in line and talk to someone at a register or to come back tomorrow. Very upsetting to see a reputable store have such rude and dismissive employees.</Review><UserId.>118078602491587291281<//UserId.>< Rate>

<Review>We always order our birthday cakes from Safeway because they never disappoint. These last two times the bakery consultant helping me was beyond amazing. Ebony went above and beyond for us! She googled ideas for me so my daughter could have her dream flamingo birthday cake and let me tell you she did not disappoint. It was everything my daughter wanted. With things being so hard right now due to Covid Ebony’s cheerful attitude and just willingness to help was such a nice treat. Thank you Ebony for your cheerful disposition and giving my baby her dream birthday cake.<//Review>< Pictures>

I've been a long standing customer in this Safeway in Santa Clara. I decided to leave a review about this one individual, She is the front end supervisor who should be promoted Stephanie! You can see her running all over the store while her Motorola beeps away. She always so helpful and accommodating. She always follows up and complete any task put in front of her.
Stephanie main concern is to fulfill her customers wishes; I know she fulfilled mine multiple times... Thank you Stephanie- You are noteworthy!

Just ran in for sour cream, (baking a Strawberry Cake, from scratch). I left with Sliced Deli Peppered Turkey, Water Crackers, Olive Tapenade and the Sour Cream, (good product placement, LOL).
Deli was understaffed, with only 1 employee at 5:30p. But the gentleman was friendly and helpful.
I used the self checkout and was out quickly. I will return.<//text>

<name>Alan Ross<//name><Rate>4< /Rate><review>What more can you say about Safeway, especially the larger stores. Lots of variety items in stock except for one of my favorite snack items of which not only Safeway but other stores heaven consistently out of stock ever since covid began. I do not know what the relation is but nonetheless all the grocery stores have been very inconsistent in the stocking of . I don't remember the brand name but they're the Polish bagel dogs very disappointing. They have the regular bagel dogs but they are nearly as good. It's not a Safeway problem it's a manufacturing I'm sure but I just wanted to complain that's all. I'm done Safeway's awesome, share prices can be a little higher than other smaller change but whenever I go to the smaller chain I regret it wish I'd gone to Safeway.<//review><user>116685814643603394457</user><gmapID>0x808fca66c9b5197d:0xae635d254508dc7f< /gmapID><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

I'm a "regular" shopper at that location and if course I start to get familiar with them as they get to know and also remember me...not necessarily by first name even though they have name badges. I can't say a "familiar" smile as we are ALL wearing mask. I guess it's the sound of the voice and their personality and the professional yet still personal way they're always helping. Oh yeah food and product...great selection. Safeways Bakery is always the BEST 😁<//review>< pics>

Love Safeway overall.  Good selection and clean stores.  Would be 5 stars if they could keep one or two more cashiers on the line.  That would make all the difference in the world.<//Text>

This is my favorite Safeway in Santa Clara. The layout is great, it's organized, and overall,  pleasant to shop in. The cashiers are friendly and the deli lady hooked me up with super fresh chicken tendies even though there was already a full batch in the case. Deli lady, I don't know your name but getting those fresh tendies made my day! Thanks a million!<//text>

I only shop here because it's the closest store. All other Safeways in my area are vastly superior. They often don't have any carts. They run out of food quit a lot. They never seem to have enough cashiers and the lines can be really long. I've requested help from the staff and either no one comes or they ignore you. This store needs a major overhaul and better staff.</text>

There were multiple homeless people around and it was shady. The moment we entered the store we were Attacked by a stranger and somehow didnt get into further conversation and had to run out of the store immediately to save ourselves. I live in Sanjose and the stores here are pretty well maintained. This one was a terribly bad experience so far. Its scary to enter the store.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808fca66c9b5197d:0xae635d254508dc7f<//gmap_id></record>

The lady at self-checkout is rude and not helpful at all. I need to void an item as I accidentally scanned it twice, but she insists to void the whole transaction and I had to scan everything all over again. The screen clearly shows an option to void single item but she rudely told me no way and asked me to go to the cashier instead. Avoid this store and go to the Sunnyvale one!< /Review>

<review>I love visiting Safeway, each and everytime any store any location.

Once I step in I always feel the latest season and holiday vibes. They're well stocked, look very premium, looks amazing and a very courteous staff. I especially like the bakery, meat and wine section 🤩😉.

That would be an understatement, they have all the grocery, fresh produce, very good collection of ready to cook food which again I have tasted a lot. And believe me the first time when you see it, we may feel they're a cheap version of poor man's takeaway. But honestly it ain't so. Unless you take one microwave it and relax in any public chair or park and eat it will feel really very good.

Truly A to Z for your personal and family needs.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>This is a nice Safeway store.  It has a lot, and a rather dense feel, in that they use just about every square inch to display something.  Good supply of produce, groceries and extras.  There is a tiny Starbucks inside so you can roam the aisles with caffeine at adequate levels.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Even though I've been shopping at this Safeway for the last 22 years it still is only marginal. The deli is routinely understaffed. In general stay away from this store on weekdays after 5pm as it can be a zoo. The bakery staff are nice n helpful. I think it's that this whole shopping center is in a decline for years. Sadly enough there's not alot of better local choices. Considering home prices its disappointing.< /text>

<review>I like this store, it's clean and the clerks are helpful. And on some Fridays they have $5 roasted chicken from the deli which is a good buy. It's in a good location of other stores as well in a shopping center. And the library is right across the street.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The staff for this small story is always courteous and helpful. To me, the store has always appeared clean and organized. Though, today I'm second guessing the cleanliness of the store after using the restrooms. The restrooms look like something from gas station in the middle of the ghetto or the middle of nowhere. They have not been maintained what appears to be months. Everything is dingy engrossed including the door. There's tagging and writing all over the walls and door also.< /review>

The cashier Rayna was rude and insulted me to another customer as I was standing two feet away. I don't know where they find these toxic cashiers but they need to hire polite employees.<//review>

<Text>Worst bakery experience... They ruined my kid's birthday cake... Here's what happened. I get there and want a customized 1/2 sheet cake but I don't find the person who actually decorates the cakes. So I leave instructions on the form and tell the person that I would come the next day. They also tell me that the decorator would call. Any come the next day I don't get a call and I go to the store and still don't find the decorator. Instead I find a new person who says that she doubts that they will make it, she told me the photo machine has been out... Etc and I was in shock. The birthday is the next day!

<review>It's really really really unfortunate that all we have to look forward to at your local Safeway are workers that are just out of highschool that are more eager to look at their phones than help a customer out.

<Text>Best and broadest variety of any of the local stores, and the prices aren't that bad - pretty good, actually, especially when you buy the store brand. The store is so large it takes a little getting used to, to find out where everything is. I mean, for a grocery store it's pretty big. The clerks were reasonably friendly and helpful, to help me find items I didn't know where to look for.</Text><response>None<//response><user_id>100823217461732685702</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I will say that the workers were friendly, but that's about it.  The prices here are outrageous!  We paid about 3 times as much for groceries here compared to home.

<Review>Sure, you can go anywhere for long lines, average prices and mediocrity. But the reason you should shun Safeway is they lock up the baby formula. You have to search the store for the one cranky person who works there and get him to extract the $7 bottle from the safe then deliver it to the checker behind a 15 minute line. Obviously you’re schlepping a baby around through all this.

Someday soon this building will be an Amazon distribution center.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

First of all, the place is insanely gross, there were no carts or baskets to be found and the picture I took is the line at 930 at night for people trying to check out. There are about 15 people in front of me with one checker and she clearly doesn’t care or have any urgency< /Review>

Clean and beautiful store, grocery is always fresh, shelves are always stacked and well organized, been there multiple times during busy and slow hours and always the store looked clean. Also the employees are fast and very helpful, you don't really have to wait long over there. Also the stuff at the bakery always fresh.<//Text>

<Text>This Safeway on Homestead near Kiely in Santa Clara is always neat well stocked and well managed. The selection is about the same as other Safeway stores but because it is well organized it seems easy to find your way around. Safeway prices on meats are good, but their produce is always expensive.< /Text>< pictures>

Clean and organized. Some items tend to run out later in the day. Employees are friendly, but the self checkout is very slow and tends to have lots of errors requiring employee overrides. It is a bonus having a Starbucks inside the store.< /Text>

Probably one of the better Safeways around here in the neighborhood. It lacks a pharmacy but has a robust single aisle with a lot of over the counter nonsense if your feeling ill. There is a Starbucks on-site as well.</review>

<Review>Not sure why Google wants a review of Safeway.  But, okay, it was Safeway and it was what you expect from a corporate grocery store.  They do a competent job, have most of the inventory in stock and the prices are not too high.< /Review>< Pics>

I was disappointed because it looks like they discontinued carrying HUNTS JALAPENO DICED TOMATOES. 😥👎.  Luckys doesn't have them now I have to "HUNTS" for them! It is great in a stew. I like to warm it up and eat it like a tomato soup. So sad!<//Text>

Not enough cashiers. Unable to open self checkout in time at 8am. Occasionally transactions need approval of a supervisor who's hiding behind the scene and slow to come solve the issue.</Review>

The location is highly convenient for me. The interior needs to be updated. The produce and meat are more expensive, but much better than wally world. I love the deli and the bakery. Also, the staff are really nice.</text>

<Review>There was FLIES in their chocolate bagels( see pic below) the flies lay their eggs INSIDE the bagel and when the eggs hatch the baby flies(maggots) eat their way through the bagel, and come up as an adult fly. It was REALLY gross. Do not recommend going here.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Helpfull staff
Good meats usually, not tonight, very lean and watery rib steaks? but its 8 on sunday so...

Quicker response to calls for cashiers at late nights is desperately needed.

Otherwise a freindly good store of goods and service.<//text>

<text>This location never seems to have enough registers open. Almost always a long wait in line, even at the so-called express lanes. Self-check-out is full of glitches and not consumer-friendly, often rejecting valid coupons or not "understanding" bar codes, and does not permit bagging items as they are rung up, which is highly inefficient and slows down the whole process. I know the company is trying to save money by reducing employees and payroll, but with this frustrating system, I strongly prefer Sprouts and Trader Joe's.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>This Safeway location has the worst friendly staff of all locations that I have shopped at. There are a handful of kind staff members but the % is very low. From the deli depertment not wanting to help, one of the butchers rolling his eyes after I ask for an item that was sold out on display, the self check clerk looking for a coupon in the flyer so I can get a just 4 u  sale price without telling me what she is doing after it did not come up automatically with my rewards number. I had a stroke almost a year ago so I have to accept a ride to the closest supermarket.< /Text>< rating>

<text>The self-checkout is complete chaos. The assistant had to swipe her card 8 times to fix issues with the machine.
Eventually our $5 off $40 wasn't accepted and the machine swallowed. Too tired to go to customer service after this ordeal.</text>< Rate>

<review>The stocking is a little weird. They’re always out of the sugar free French vanilla Lucerne creamer; maybe they should try ordering more of that flavor? And they run out of kombucha super fast too. But there aren’t lines and it’s clean and the cheeses and produce are great, so still doing better than most safeways.< /review>< user_id>

The computers went down when I was there and the staff did not know how to deal with it.  They had a few register come back up.  Instead of forming one line and helping customers at the working ones; they sent to customers to the end of the line for the working ones.  To me this says Safeway does not train there employees well.  Even the managers were just acting like it was no big deal when the customers tried to speak with them.  She was claiming they were doing there best.  If that is there best they might need to get some additional training.< /review>

This is actually the worst Starbucks I've ever been too. Two of the ladies that work there (one with short hair and glasses and another with long hair who puts all of it in a cap) are full of attitude. They've yelled at customers and each other and are constantly rolling there are eyes. I've never gotten a smile let alone a thank you for shopping. I hope someone sets them straight or let's them go, if not they're going to lose a lot of customers.< /review>
