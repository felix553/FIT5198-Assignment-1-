Came here for the first time. I'm new to vaping and Moe not only sold me some amazing flavors he went through step by step educating me about my device and how to care for it. He even gave me a one time use chamber to switch between the two flavors I bought.

There is no doubt that I'll be coming back, really friendly and helpful here!</text>

Had never been here before. I called ahead of time to see about a replacement glass for my tank.
Erin was really helpful and knowledgeable. I ended up buying a new tank and never would have known about the Crown 3 because my normal vape shops don't carry them. I am happy with my tank and walked away satisfied with the A+ customer service.</text>

< review>
This place lost a $100 worth of my business today.  I walked  in and needed help with a setup I bought yesterday.  They pushed some buttons and said.. you should be all set.  I took a hit and said it tasted burnt.  He said he's be with me in a minute.  Meanwhile he and two other guys sat there and sampled flavors out of bottles off the shelf.  The guy never even responded to me again.  I stood there for 10 more minutes and left.  What he didn't bother to check is that I had wanted a new tank, juice and coils.  He lost me as a customer (I spend $100 a week on this stuff) and today's sale.< /review>

I am not sure about the pricing but it seemed reasonable.  Great shop with good inventory

This place is a joke. Do not go here. Their prices are rediculous. I know the owner and he said I was getting a discount on a mod. I payed 80. I went to another store and without a discount it was 50 and online it's listed for 39.99. Never ever go here you are wasting money. Order your stuff online.< /Review>

Haven't used my atty in a really long time. I took it to Corner Vapory to have it rebuilt. Upon walking in I realized the old staff wasn't there, Omar was!!! He killed it on my tri-coil build...never better! The new staff is actually really friendly and knowledgeable. If you haven't visited there in a while or are looking for an alternative shop, THIS IS THE SPOT!!! Thanks again guys :)))< /text>

<text>Me and my husband are in town from Phoenix and drove by and wanted to stop and check this place out. We walked in and nobody even greeted us. Then we looked around for a few minutes. We then had to ask to see what flavors of juice they carried which the gentleman behind the counter seemed very annoyed we asked.  Then my husband asked if they have testers and he said yes.  So then we stood there for about 10 minutes without a word to us . Never even asked what we would like to try.  He stood there talking to his friend and ignoring us. We then just left. What horrible customer service.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Great place. My fiance and I wanted to quit smoking so we decided to start "vaping". We knew nothing about it and he thoroughly explained every term and what each peice and thing does. Prices are a little high but the friendly service outweighs that tenfold. Highly recommend... and is newby friendly. Thanks!!!</Review><response>None< /response><pics>None</pics>< rate>

Solid vape shop with really helpful dudes within. Like most places, ejuice is insane compared to online pricing and their selection of cheaper high quality RDAs & RDTAs is fairly limited to non-existent, but that goes for all shops. They spent a solid amount of time explaining anything you need help with and do a great job with their coil wraps on your deck (with their or your materials) for $8.</Text>

I just wanted to quit 🚬 but am a veteran vapor now and take my word!& spend your money here! Dont go to any other place.you will be treated great and always find the newest and best products available. Outstanding selection of vape juice like whitestone circus, my fav.please leave your other crappy, pakey,nasty tobacco shops! Stop waisting your hard earnd quid at those other shaddy, hookie, pop up-a-hooptie vape and pipe shops dammit! So go the corner vapory now. Best advice, spend a little bit more or up-grade treat your self the best of everything. You eill not be disappointed. Ever!  P.s. viva trump.<//text>

Fun to sit at the bar and watch the chef's cook! Their new location is bigger and has a nice outdoor patio dining area. We love to share a few tapas, salad and dessert.  The Sangria is delicious and service is right there whenever you need them.< /text>

<review>I thought it was clever their menu groups food by Earth Land & Sea The food was unusual- not combinations I'd seen before. The staff was very friendly and provided great service. I enjoyed the food but would have added a pinch more seasoning to the chicken and french fries. Just my personal taste but I recommend you try it yourself!<//review><date>1483632459164< /date>< Resp>

This place is actually amazing! Their daily menu board is very creative and delicious. Too bad I will never visit this place again but you should try it if you live close by. They get super busy for weekend nights so reservation is recommended!</Text>

18 months ago I was here on business and discovered the Black Trumpet - love it!! I'm back in town on a new project and had to go back (especially since my wife joined me for our anniversary). As always the food was exceptional as is this staff! Tuna Tatar my favorite as are the specials. Worth the wait.<//Text>

Osteria Mamma is all about the experience.  Don't come if you're hungry, grumpy or with bad company.  Dinner will take a while.  But, if you come with the right expectations and the right dinner companions, it can be fantastic.<//Text>

The Black Trumpet Bistro was the perfect spot for a book club lunch! Some of us are regulars of this local favorite and those in our club that were new to the dining experience are now converts. We spent more time discussing and trying each other’s dishes than we did our book selection and this is a group with some amazing home cooks so that is quite a testament to the menu!
Dino is not just the owner of this exceptional restaurant; he is a true chef who works his magic in the kitchen daily. Interesting flavor combinations, unique sauces, high quality ingredients, and numerous daily specials featuring some bold dining choices are the reasons why Dino has a VERY loyal following both at Black Trumpet Bistro and his other establishment in Huntington Beach, Capone’s Italian Cucina. Friendly service, fair prices, and a warm ambiance don’t hurt. We look forward to our next meals at both of these favorites!< /review>

THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN HB. I heard a lot of great things about this restaurant but never checked it out. I finally had the opportunity to come here with my girlfriend and we were both really impressed not just by the food but with the customer service and the ambiance of the restaurant. We ate like Kings and decided to try a lot of the popular items on the menu. As Guy would say, welcome to "flavor town". EVERYTHING was delicious. My favorite thing and the best bang for your buck is the cheese plate, so many different flavors and textures. But you can't go wrong with the tapas menu. Great spot to bring a date, I highly recommend this place!! Shout out to Kale, he's the man< /text>

Our food was great.the best lobster bisque that I ever had. Very thick with a hint of sherry. My husband had the eggs benedict and said they were delicious.Our server was very friendly. You must try the ginger agave soda. It was the perfect refreshment to complete brunch. Highly recommend  Seasons 52.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><rate>5< /rate></record>

Love this new location at Goldenwest and Yorktown.  Enjoyed the upscale atmosphere and cool "jazz meets winery" themed decor while sipping wine at the bar.  We were seated pretty quickly considering it was a Saturday night, and our server, John, did a great job explaining the specials.  The four of us ate Tapas style and our favorites included the Halibut (special), Lobster rigatoni, and the veal meatballs.  We brought our own wine ($18 corkage) and loved the dessert (banana-nut-chocolate) It was delicious!</review>

Medium sized restaurant, moving soon. Comfortable atmosphere, great seating options. Cool decor.

You'll die over their calamari. It's perfect. Tuna tartare is just under the borderline of too spicy. Lamb meatballs (today's special) are a bit too spicy for my mom. If you're spice sensitive, order some milk!

The servers know the menu and food really well.
Ridiculously friendly, not pushy.

Mom says they don't take reservations. If you come for lunch during the week, you won't need one anyway. Avoid dinners and weekends.

Really good at accommodating (nut) allergies. I will be back.< /Review>

Came here randomly for lunch as I was on a lunch break from working out in Huntington Beach. I really loved the name of the place. I went in and was so suprised to see the place packed! That's always a good sign. I just had the Kale salad, which was amazing. I'm not ususally into salads too much (especially Kale), but my waiter told me it was one of his favorites so I gave it a try. Yum Yum! It was very good & I was very impressed! So 2 thumbs up for Black Trumpet!!< /review>

Outstanding food and service. The french onion soup is to die for. The steak, pizza, and brussel sprouts were all amazing as well. They have a very diverse menu that includes Duck, lamb, chicken, steak and seafood and fresh desserts as well..!!!<//review>

We both love this bistro! The variety on the menu is international/mediterranean.  My husband never would eat brussels sprouts until he tried them at Black Trumpet. I love the  Lamb Lollipop and the duck breast (served with a pomegranate reduction that perfectly compliments without overpowering) are my person favorite from the Land portion of the menu. The portions are perfect for a romantic share!</Text>

A fun spot for lunch. Was told to come give this place a visit for lunch. Came with my girlfriend and we had a lot of fun. The cook was basically a bartender for us and our server was very fun and inviting. Great atmosphere and cool vibes for sure< /Text>

Came here randomly for lunch as I was on a lunch break from working out in Huntington Beach. I really loved the name of the place. At first it was a little hard to tell if they were open or not, but Trip Advisor said they were, so I went in and was so suprised to see the place packed! That's always a good sign. I just had the Kale salad, which was amazing. I'm not ususally into salads too much (especially Kale), but my waiter told me it was one of his favorites so I gave it a try. Yum Yum!

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I love tapas. There are so many delicious choices. Be sure to order from the specials if any of them look good. Plenty of parking as it is in a strip mall area. Good environment. Usually don't have to wait at all if you go on a weekday. It is small though and be prepared for it to be dark like most fancier restaurants are to add ambience. Right after sunset though they lift up the blinds and it's really nice then.< /Text>< pics>

There aren't a lot of low-key wine bar and fine dining places in Huntington Beach so this was my favorite restaurant there. Great local spot for food lovers, jazz, and tapas with an elegant ambiance. Staff is also very friendly. A local favorite.<//Text>

Amazing. Snuck in on Valentine's Day unexpectedly, with kids while here at a conference. The manager came to greet us, told us there was some interesting flavors to try, some even a little weird, and all would be good. Then he have my wife a single rose for Valentine's Day. He was right. We had special stuffed Risotto, Salami Pizzete, Beef Wellington, Brussel sprouts and some amazing banana chocolate dessert. All to die for. Try it, or regret it.</Review>

I love Tapas food.  I love sitting at the chef bar where you can watch them create the beautiful and yummy food.  They have a great selection of wines at a reasonable price and the service is exceptional.

Lamb lollipops, pan roasted duck breast, Sicillian stuffed mushrooms, truffle fries, tuna tartar to share and much more!!  I'm making myself hungry!!<//Review>

<Review>I love this place! Food was delicious and the atmosphere/ambience was nice. They have an amazing wine selection even though I don't drink. Food was fresh and comes out steaming hot. The dessert selection was great. They bring out a tray of desserts for you to choose from. I had the raspberry/strawberry cake with coconut. The cake was moist and fluffy and the sauce was sweet and tart, delicious!< /Review>< gmap_id>

Exceptional!

This is one of those small places that you feel you must write about to give them their due, but you hate to tune in more people to this place because they are already packed for business. But alas, must do the right thing...

The food here was absolutely incredible - top to bottom. I thought I was at the CIA (culinary institute) having dinner. It just had those perfect chef touches on each dish.

We had several of the tapas plates for appetizers and the the main meal. I enjoyed the Steak Frites with a juicy, perfectly trimmed and cooked Sirloin. My wife had the special which was fish and said it was amazing.

Very good wine menu to accompany the food with a nice bar area that fills up quickly.

Just know, if you go on the weekend after 6, you will be waiting outside for a table for awhile. It's unfortunate but speaks to how good this place is.< /Review>

< Review>
Every time we visit the Black Trumpet we are never disappointed.  Never mind that the menu is crafted by one of the great chefs here in America, if not beyond, Dino. He's always available and will often come and say hello and shake your hand. That's when you get the opportunity to share with him how perfect his food is and how wonderful are his staff. They don't take reservations and they are open for lunch too. They have an extensive wine list as they are a wine bar and now they will be serving mixed cocktails. We stumbled upon this great Bistro a couple of years ago before it made its move to Seacliff Village. I believe we have been there at least 12 or 15 times. Always a great evening without exception! We always have the clam and mussel appetizer with the smoked French bread that is toasted, it is hard to describe how delicious is this dish. This last visit my husband had the Coltrane which is a filet mignon with french fries and as usual it was flavorful, tender, and a large portion. I tried something new as I was hungry for rotisserie chicken. The Cornish game hen was unbelievably savory tender and with perfect and crispy skin. Served with saffron pilaf and mixed vegetables including asparagus. The handcrafted fair at this restaurant is beyond five stars and consistent. The ambiance in their new location is also like an exciting French bistro. There is an outdoor patio with a fire pit or indoor dining where you feel as if you're in a French nightclub. We love sitting at the bar or at the open kitchen where the chefs are always friendly and love to entertain. I can't say enough about this extraordinary  gem in Huntington Beach. Romantic, comfortable, inviting and you always feel like you've arrived at a family home restaurant.  Plenty of parking and wheel chair accessible. Don't miss this one for a wonderful occasion or just a date night out!</Review>

Came here on a Friday evening with a small group of friends after a glowing recommendation from a friend.

The ambiance was super cute. It's a very small and cozy restaurant, but what i loved most was how the service never felt rushed and attention to detail! They have an amazing wine list to compliment their extensive menu. The menu is definitely both veg and non-veg friendly which was a huge win for our party.

While they are a small restaurant, expect to wait and enjoy a glass of wine from their bar. They also do not take reservations.

For dinner, we shared family style and ordered numerous items. Items included:
- Baked Brie
- Truffle Fries
- Daily Special (Eggplant Parmesan)
- Daily Special (Lamb Kebobs)
- Brussels Sprouts w/ chorizo o the side
- Fig Pizza

Everything turned out AMAZING! The food comes out as plates are hot and ready, so don't expect this to all come out at once. Definitely more of the tapas style.

Overall, amazing food, wine selection and dessert selection! So glad we finally came here and will definitely be back again for more food soon!!</text>

The chicken, onion soup and desserts are excellent.  However, the hummus is liquidy and the falafels are a bit dry and salty.  Atmosphere is cool, but they really have to do something about the smell in the men's bathroom.  Although the men's bathroom was very clean it smells like there's a gas leak.< /Text>

<rating>4</rating><Text>The elegant nice place to eat third time eating at the restaurant haven't had a bad experience until last night I ordered the salmon and the salmon came petrified it was overcooked it's  has to be very hard for a chef to ruin the first ticket in of the night we were the first ones there nobody else in the restaurant I think they need somebody to oversee the meals that are going out to the customers to make sure their perfected before being served this error could have been caught before the waitress brings the meal the customer but overall it's a nice place to go that won't stop me from going back it has a nice atmosphere The Waitresses worried about me not coming back it says I'll be back I probably won't order the fish again the only upseting thing was $73 to end the night my date got to eat but I went home hungry I still give it a 4-star rating I would be giving it a 5 but a bad meal takes one star away</Text>< pics>

Great Chef, menu, decor, wines and beer (no mixed drinks yet..but pending)... generally very busy after 530. Because of very reasonable prices and delishes gastro pub sized portions.. probably one of the top places to eat in the OC.</Text>

I went with 2 other friends and we shared our dishes. We began with the pear and gorgonzola salad, followed by stuffed mushrooms and duck breast in a pomegranate sauce. So good!!! A skewer of blackened shrimp + all the fixins followed. We had excellent service and really enjoyed our visit.<//review>

Their one high chair had a broken buckle, and we have twins, so they were hard to manage, not baby friendly. First nicer restaurant we've been to that had only one high chair and it was unapologetically broken. Three veal sliders were awesome. Tacos ok but overpriced. Sandwich pretty authentic and flavorful. Cauliflower was as good as cauliflower gets! Small place in a strip mall that could not accommodate parties over 4-5, 34 people total. $20-$30 per person before drinks.< /Text>

The Black Trumpet is truly a medditeranian marvel. With a fantastic staff and atmosphere, great music, and some of this best tapas this side of the Atlantic, The Black Trumpet will satisfy everytime. This place became in an evening, a regular spot for personal friends and family. Almost tempted to give a negative review purely in keeping this place a secret, but my love for the food gave me no choice but to speak truly and ensure its continued success.</review>

At first glance, this restaurant's interior doesn't say much but once you enter you'll be surprised by how busy it is.

I was casually looking for a place to eat for date night and found this restaurant black trumpet bistro.

Interior decor looks nice. Very much like a nice bistro.  We were seated on chef's table because it was so busy.  Chef's table - there you can see them at work making your meal.  They were fast in getting our appetizers and entrees out.

I don't think the truffle fries were worth it.  There was no flavor in the fries and tasted more like garlic fries.  Duck breast appetizer was totally worth it.  The right amount of fat and protein.  Tasty!

Had lamb shank and it was ok.  I thought it was a little too salty but otherwise it was very tender.  Figs were a nice touch.  I've never had figs with my entree before.

Fiance had kabob.  At first he was worried one stick of steak kabob was not enough but actually it worked with w the veggie kabob and the meat chunks was pretty big.

Overall it's a nice place to check out.  Will recommend people to come a little early for better seating.<//Review>

Heard from 2 friends the was good so I tried it last nite.  When we arrived, there were 3 people standing outside.  When we asked what the wait was they said they didn't know.  So I went inside.  There is no hostess station.  A waiter walked by and ignored me.  I was able to get the eye of someone in a white chef's coat but he kept chatting with a couple of customers.  Everyone in the restaurant ignored us, soooo, I left.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Of the best places I ate during my trip to LA. The exquisite tapas. I recommend them. Of course you have to go early because it is full.

What didn’t you like about my restaurant?\nHaving a bad dining experience at a restaurant – sucks. What sucks even more is being an owner or employee at a restaurant and discovering that a negative review has been left about my establishment that you pour your heart and soul into week in week out.\nI’m not telling anybody not to leave negative reviews, I’m just going to attempt to shed some light on the situation from the point of view of the people who the reviews impact the most.\nFor you it’s 5 minutes out of your day that you spend tapping away at your keyboard and letting hundreds (if not thousands) of people know how you had “the WORST meal EVER”, and how Sally didn’t bring you water after you asked “3 TIMES!!!!!” Or how you had to wait. There are many restaurants that do not accept reservations. and letting the world know that you “will NEVER EVER be back!!!!!” – you click ‘post’ and carry on with your day, perhaps totally unaware of the emotional and financial impact that your review may have on the people that it’s aimed at. Negative reviews have the potential to be soul crushing for the people on the receiving end, we have probably worked extremely long hours in very stressful conditions and have probably done a great job and been able to provide a great experience for 99% of our customers. We might send out 400 meals in a day under very rushed and stressful conditions, if just 1 of those 400 meals is less than perfect there is a chance that the poor chef will be persecuted in the form of a bad review online. How many other occupations exist where one mistake that you make at work will be posted online for thousands of people to read about?\nThe hospitality industry is a tough one – high stress, low profit margins, a nation-wide shortage of qualified or experienced staff and far more establishments than there are customers to fill them. The stress within our industry is widely documented.\nI am. Or trying to make you  feel sorry for me and or any one from my restaurant , and all other restaurants that you have left a bad one star review, I just often wonder when I read a negative review if the person writing it would have a change of heart if they knew the amount of hard work and stress that’s involved in running a restaurant (and yes things sometimes do go wrong). Hospitality professionals are a tough bunch, most negative reviews are brushed off like water off a duck’s back (and any actual constructive criticism noted). Sometimes however a negative review really can be the straw that broke the camel’s back. A negative review when you’re exhausted from working long hard hours really can compound the stress so much more and lead to many sleepless nights, agonising over what you could’ve done to avoid that review. Owner/operators of venues also have the added anxiety of wondering about the financial implications of negative reviews (in an industry where margins are very tight as it is).\nThere are far more effective and constructive ways of providing feedback at a restaurant than writing an online review. It is amazing the amount of people who will fail to mention that there is any problem whilst at the restaurant but then go home and absolutely crucify the establishment on social media. Yourself and the restaurant have a common goal which is for you to have an enjoyable experience, if something isn’t up to scratch let us know! Something can be done – a new meal made, a refund given, a sincere apology – none of this can happen however if the first time they hear of a problem is via an online review.\nSo please, before writing that scathing review – ask yourself a few questions:-\n* Have you ever made a mistake at work? Was the mistake broadcasted in the form of a review for thousands of people to read?\n* Did you give my restaurant ample opportunity to rectify the problem at the time?\n* Is a review the most constructive way to voice your concerns? or could you call the restaurant and speak to a manager?\n* Does the punishment fit the crime? (the crime being whatever happened that deemed it an unsatisfactory experience – the punishment possibly being prolonged emotional and financial strain for numerous people)\nI hope that I’ve been able to give you a glimpse into what can happen after a negative review comes through from the point of view of us on the other side and maybe it will make a couple of people think twice before unleashing their nasty negative review.\nI wish you the very best.\nDino Ferraro\nChef/ proprietor'}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Date>1618690118173< /Date><Response>None<//Response><review>Half the dash is dusty, center console not vacuumed, not wiped clean, passenger seat still with crumbs on it. I understand the minimum wage guys no caring much , but the manager shrugging his shoulder and condescendingly explaining that, “a $20 wash only includes a little bit of wipe down” is just upsetting. Who decides which half of the dash is cleaned for $20? Not even trying to correct the mistake is outrageous. Last month they were begging customers, now no one even cares.<//review>< UserId.>

I spoke with my cashier and he informed me that there may have been a misunderstanding on what was purchased through groupon. The 5 Washes are exterior washes only as stated on the Groupon website. The exterior washes can be upgraded to full services by adding the value of each wash from the purchase rate in this case it's the rate from groupon. We didn't try and cheat you out of a wash or try and charge you more than necessary."}<//response>

I usually leave car washes unhappy with the service, but today I decided to try a new place. Tony listened carefully and understood my concerns and gained a new customer in the process. I left this place very happy with my car looking better than ever.... THANKS!< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I’m impressed by the quality and customer service. Had some serious scratches on my black car and a body shop suggested VAS detailing & buffing service, before spending money on a costly paint job. They did a fantastic job buffing out numerous scratches and impeccably detailed and waxed the car.

This is one of my first Google reviews, ever. I can truly say that the staff and managers made it a great experience!

I’ll be returning to Valencia Auto Spa!< /Text><UserId.>101030831630395416226<//UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Worse Experiencia With the New Old Man (owner )
He should retire and enjoy his life because he looks too stressed.
THEY want me to Bring my car Darty and wet.
( No way)
It’s better to get a car  wash mobile detailed For $25.00 Dollars only. With out going out of your house.</Text>

If I can give a negative review I would, if you look at my previous reviews I almost never make a bad review since I know how a bad review can hurt a company, however, be ware of this place I took my  Range Rover with new rims that were placed two days ago and they scratched the rim so bad.  I try talking to the employee and the manager and they kept saying that it was not done there. I know for a fact it was done there because like I said they were new. The manager didn’t really care, so maybe if the owner sees this review please respond. The manager is not very capable of dealing with complaints.</Text>

<Review>Used to go every week. I’m not sure what’s changed, ownership? New employees? But the lack of customer service is something I can’t take anymore. Down right rude! I don’t need to spend 30 dollars a week for attitude. Also, they never do what I ask. I take my dogs out a lot and need a really good vacuum, I pay for the premium wash and always request a great vacuum...I will pay extra. I always have to redo it now when I get home. Not doing it anymore. Started going to the car wash on mcbean by the shell station. So much better. They are nice and very kind. I’ve had with those snotty girls at the register. They should smile more.</Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Paid $65 and my car came out looking like it got a $5 wash. Before I even sent it in I told them I needed a couple small stains taken out of the driver seat and armrest along with a sticker removed on the back window since I had just purchased the car and I didn’t mind paying more. The guy washing my car brought it out and the car was still dirty. Stains still in the seats and armrest and sticker on the window. I asked him about it and he said he was told to just wash it??? So he went back and rubbed the seat and armrest with a towel which still didn’t remove the stains and then scraped the sticker off. Gunk was left from the sticker he didn’t even bother removing. I waited about an hour and a half for possibly the worst wash I’ve ever had. I used to come here often and I previously even did business with this car wash but quality is not a concern. I definitely will not be returning.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c28712d771db33:0x1b4ced11af89f88b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I REPEAT do not go here. I went in at 10:30 AM on a Wednesday went straight home and looked at my car. I realized there was not only a chip in my windshield but also a chip on my friends windshield who was the car in front of me. Called the manager to notify her, took her 30 minutes to call me back and  she did nothing. She said it's the heat from outside, (it was 88 degrees) that I should look it up on google, and I should have called earlier. Both me and my friend had chips and scratches so this is VERY unlikely. So went in paying 11$ for a car wash came out having to pay $75 for my windshield to be repaired. NOT PLEASED. Will not return ever, highly dissapointed and frustrated. I would understand if it was just my car but it was also my friends so I know it was something there. DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR WINDSHIELD CHIPPED.<//text>

<review>I went to another car wash and they told me that I would need to get a full detail wash to clean my car, this place told me that they would only need to have it go through an extra time for a little extra, didn't even need go through again. Amazing job for such a great price!< /review>< pictures>

Stay away, bait and switch for car detailing, they will quote you a price over the phone, and when you get there they will try to charge you way more. If you try to negotiate, they will eliminate things from your package and still quote you higher than what they said on the phone for a full detail. I went with a mobile detailer, came to my house super convenient and charged less</review>

<Review>I have been here about 7 times, i usually go after getting my oil changed at oil stop because you get a free car wash (just the outside of your car) The past four times I have been getting the inside of car cleaned as well, it’s an additional 10 bucks, why not! Today was the last time I pay them to clean the inside. I never write reviews but I’m so freakin over it. Every single time they don’t clean the dash board, also there is always still dirt all over the doors.  I get it it 10 bucks but seriously?!? It looks like no has even tried. Also I always ask for a scent in my car and they never put it. I try and ask the employees but they just say they did it.  I hate writing stupid reviews but I’m so over it! Hopefully this saves someone’s money!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c28712d771db33:0x1b4ced11af89f88b<//GmapID></record>

<Review>I am a regular weekly customer.  I came in during the week when they were supposed to be opening at 8 am.  I had to call on the phone to get someone's attention and they asked how I was paying and what kind of wash.  5 minutes after opening time  I finally got in.  Then I went to use the self-serve vacuums and they were all disconnected. When I asked one of the workers to help me they all disbanded.  A very nice gentleman customer, in a suit mind you, came and tried to help me plug the vacuum in without success. Finally, a worker came and fixed the two vacuums that weren't working. Many times, I have come in the morning and they're not turned on, also.  I've been going to this place for a long time and never had such a hassle.</Review><date>1501086848640</date>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1501196035623, 'text': "Hello Nancy,\nOur apologies for a late start a few of our employees got caught in the traffic during that terrible accident on the 14th freeway, but it still doesn't excuse the vacuums not being attached or turned on. We're working on different methods in order to be more efficient and run a smoother opening when an incident like this happens. I would like to invite you to return for a complimentary full service carwash."}</response></record></dataset><record>

Poor customer service. The employees rather talk amongst each other than actual help the customers out. However, I managed to help my self out and find what I was looking for. The problem is not the store.</text>

We came in to this store to get my mom some shoes. As we walked in there were  3 employees all of them inside the register. We didn't get greeted when we were inside. We finally found the shoe style we wanted and my husband had to go to the register and ask if they had it in the size we were looking for. They didn't. So he asked if they could check if another store had it and her response was...."we can order it for you". He got on Google called the store in Lynnwood and trough the phone they told him the one in the citadel had it. We then called citadel and they placed the shoe on hold. There was only 1 other customer in the store and didn't see any of three employees say a word to her. They all just stood in the register.

We went to the store at the citadel and we're greeted as we approached the door. While my husband was in line one of the employees went around asking if anyone needed help. As we left the store we were thanked for stopping buy.

So if you are looking for shoes save yourself some time and drive out to the citadel. Where they can actually help you find a stye, where they actually greet you and where you are appreciated for your business.<//text>

<text>The food is great here but its much more greasy since the ownership changed!! I've been coming here for 11 years and I had no problem with the food. Though the Al Pastor is very very greasy and the burritos are not the same. I feel bad typing this because the owners are amazing but this is just how I feel.

Edit: The food isn't as bad anymore, it is very good now, I made this review like a year ago so my opinion has changed since then.< /text><resp>None< /resp>< username>

I usually like Papa Pancho’s, but last night we had tacos and burritos that were so oily that we couldn’t eat them. I hope this will be corrected or we won’t be able to go back. We are hoping this restaurant will succeed. We don’t need another empty spot in San Lorenzo.</Text>

This was one of my favorite places to go for over 10 years. The new owners have changed everything for the bad. The food sucks no meat all rice in the burritos and no cheese in the quesadillas.< /text>

<Text>I love this place and only wish I would have visited more often since I returned to California in November 2018.  The food is awesome and the service is good.  I think the prices are great and the owner is super friendly.  I am anxious to try other items on the menu besides the carne asada super burrito which was AMAZING.  Be sure to check them out.<//Text></record>

Fast service, kind and friendly staff, very clean place and good food. Best chilaquiles EVER! Crispy, delicious and beware, might be a bit  spicy some times, but always, always amazing. Thank you Papa Pancho's for preparing the chilaquiles just like my mom used to!   :)<//text>

My car was broken into a month ago, and my insurance picked this shop to do the door repairs! Took a little longer than expected but I was overjoyed with the service and constant communication!

On top of that, recently my splash guard randomly fell on one side during a long drive, I called about it and they just screwed it back on for me, no questions asked and no charges given! This shop is like a friendly neighbor that’s good with cars! As long as I live in Sacramento, I’ll be coming here!< /Review>

Great communication process in place. I got a very concise estimate. They went the extra mile to be sure to match my paint color in an undetectable way.  They have a relationship with Hertz to expedite a car rental process with a drop off and drive away.  I really trusted them because their words matched their actions!<//Review>

I have used them more times then I had hoped for (too many incidents my vehicles encounter). Dustin communicates about job progress and issues that impact timeliness of work completion very well.

The Repair looks great. They were very helpful, finished on time, and went out of their way to help me get the car back. They actually delivered my car to my house and returned my rental car for me because I was stuck in meetings all day and couldn't get over to them. They explained how to care for the fresh paint, and how the warranty works. Very happy.</Text>

<Review>Thanks to Jace, my car came back better than it was before I was rear-ended by a semitruck in a construction zone on I5. They took their time to make sure every part matched. There was zero interaction with the other driver’s insurance company because Jace did everything. My car’s back bumper is so pretty and shiny, and the paint matches perfectly.< /Review>< Pics>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I took my 2007 Mercedes CLS550 to Kneiesel's Shop after it was hit on drivers side rear bumper. I went through my insurance company because it was a hit and run at an apartment complex, my insurance company said they would warrantee the work on my vehicle for life if I took it to Kniesel. After looking at the reviews, I decided to take my vehicle there for repairs. The shop was clean and the employees working there were professional when processing my claim, especially Ryan who did the work on my vehicle. I explained to him that my car is my baby and he fully understood how well I took care of my car. There was great communication between me and the shop, they even have a good relationship with Enterprise for renting vehicles if you need one. The repairs came out perfect, I highly recommend this shop if you need repairs on your vehicle.< /text>< Pictures>

Kniesel's replaced the driver door on my F-150 and did a great job.  The paint was faded in so the door didn't stand out as a different color and it looks great.<//Review>

<Date>1572883914768</Date><rate>1</rate><Text>I wanted to work with this shop based off of the location of the shop and because of how much time spent responding to reviews they seem to invest. I was initially impressed.

Sadly, the office staff were not interested in showing the same in customer satisfaction.

I acknowledge, I haven't had to participate in this process in over 20 years. I was unaware that an appointment was required.

But instead of explaining the process to my wife, daughter, and myself while we were standing right in front of the staff, we were belittled for not having an appointment. Our questions were ignored, are we were asked to provide a claim number with no information in return.

I actually had high hopes for this shop. Sadly, we left frustrated. Our time wasted, and still uncertain as to the process, we had to go to a competitor to have our questions answered.

I'm not saying NOT to use this shop. I'm asking that their office staff are either better trained or practice more patience.

I understand that this is what you deal with daily. Your customers however, may and probably do not.<//Text>< pictures>

My car was broken into on the passenger side window. I used my insurance and they chose this shop. Not only did my car take longer than expected to fix, when I picked it up there was still glass on the floor, cup holder, and windshield shade. I also had a white material like dust that was all over the car. I am glad I cleaned up most of the glass prior to giving it to them or else I fear the window would still be on my floor. To top everything off, they broke my rearview mirror. When I asked them about this they almost dismissed my concerns. They brushed me off and said to come back later and they would order the part. When I asked how long this would take they told me it could take up to a week. Therefore, they have no concerns about me driving around without adequate safety measures on my vehicle. This shop is so highly rated but I feel like I was not taken care of as a customer. I still haven’t heard back from the shop about my mirror or the state of my car when I picked it up. If you take want someone to take care of your vehicle and treat you as a valued customer, try another shop. There are plenty of other shops out there that can value your service and treat your car with respect!</Text>

There are many car repair shops in the Sacramento area.
But it's not easy to find a good repair shop.
I was looking for a repair shop in an accident a while ago, and I happened to watch an Internet review.
We found KNIESEL'S COLLISION X STREET and began repairing it.
I believed in the kindness of Dustin, an office worker and manager, and when the repair was completed, the belief deepened.
I appreciate your kindness.Thank you for the perfect repair of the car.

<text>We took our 2014 Chevy Cruz in for some front end damage. The bumper, headlight, hood and some other parts needed to be replaced and painted. The paint is a grey metallic, so we were a little worried about the paint matching, especially on the plastic bumper.

Desiree was great. She was on top of the repairs from start to finish. She kept us updated through out the process. Her and Justin both addressed our concerns quickly and professionally.

We were very happy with the repairs. Everything looked great! The parts lined up and the paint matched up perfectly.

We would highly recommend them!<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>Glad I made the choice to take my car to this location. Everyone is really friendly, and ready to help you with any questions you have. They continue to update you on any changes or just to keep you updated on the work that's being done to your car. Desiree Ramirez is an amazing person to work with. She answered all my questions clearly, her level of professionalism is off the roof, and manages her customers so well that you feel comfortable having your car in their hands. Best of all they gave me life warranty for the job done to my car! I would've given them a five star rating, but it took them longer them expected to do the job.

Do not take your car to this place. I took my car here because Kniesel's is supposed to be a reputable place but when I picked my car up after a two day front end fix, the front bumper did not sit right. Instead of taking the car back right away, they kept blaming it on the lexus part. Finally, after numerous calls of me not being happy, they had me bring it back in. At first they didn't want to pay for the car rental, but finally agreed. I asked when my car would be ready but they could not give me a timeframe. Come Friday I get a call at 4 pm telling me my car was ready. I could not pick up because I work out of town. Now they are charging me for three days of car rental for a hour notice to pick up and what is worse, the car does not look any better from when I first brought it in. They are scammers and only nice when you first bring something in or agree with them-other than that you are treated rudely. Definitely not a reputable place.</Text>

< review>
Here’s our NIGHTMARE in Kinesel’s: On December 17th, they towed our car to their office and said everything can be fixed on Jan. 4th. But they delayed the schedule again and again, from Jan. 4th to 9th, to 11th, then 18th, then 22nd. Every Friday they gave me a lot of excuses that things can’t be done. And last night, Jan 23@5pm, we finally got our car, but when we turned on, the battery light is still on, When driving there's a serious abnormal noise in the front of the car. Jace told us there’s because the old battery, but we just bought our battery last year. We went to AutoZone to check the car. It show there the alternator turned on Failed. It means the alternator can't generate electricity. there's why the battery light is still on. We just can drive about 50 miles, and the battery will be dead. And they didn’t know why there’s the abnormal noise. We trusted Kinesel’s but after delay for 20 days, there’s what we got? We suffer a lot due to the accident even there’s not our liabilities. I cannot concentrate on my work. We need to call the rental company again and again for a extension. I cannot sleep even now is 3:43am. And the most important thing is we rely on them and now we feel life-threatening when we on the car. Can somebody tell me what we can do?<//review>

Years back we had our auto serviced by these guys in Rocklin, and the work was incredible. I now reside in Sacramento, and needed help once again. Dustin S. and the receptionist were incredibly courteous, friendly, and professional. Service like this is rare, and its refreshing that Kniesels continues to provide the exemplary customer service I experienced today. I highly recommend this business.< /review>

<review>My experience with this shop was a nightmare!  I will never do business with them again. The work was sub-par, there were interior pieces missing when they called me to pick it up, and the paint looked terrible. They said it would take 7 days to fix my truck, it took them 23. Octavio was flat out lying to me on several occasions. The manger Steve I believe tries, but he seems to be in over his head as he had know idea what was going on, or what his employee's are up too. Avoid this shop at all costs.</review><Rate>1</Rate>< Resp>

I'm giving this place a 2 star rating because I'm being generous. Let me say that everyone here is nice from the clerk to the manager, but after they take for ever to fix your car nice just doesn't cut it anymore. I've been dealing with a guy named Soto and another named Octavio and EVERY SINGLE TIME I spoke to them the date to pick my cat up was pushed back further. I was completely out done when a pick up on Friday turned into a pick up on Monday because it's raining outside?? What? If I'm not mistaken they don't paint outside. After 17 days of not having a car Octavio to "help me out" with a loaner in which I can not pick up until 2 day prior to getting my car back.  Ok what's going on with this place.  Everything is slow moton with. It took them 5 days to even think about touching my car when it arrived. I'm starting to think they get paid by the day because this started off as a 9 day job. My insurance picked this place for me in order for me not to pay 30% of my damages I said ok. But now I wish I would have just paid the 30% *thumbs down*< /review>

My family members love this place, but I just found it so-so. I'm vegan, and I found their available options to be pretty limited. When I allowed the chef to just come up with something, I thought the results were just okay, but not great.

Aside from the food options, the space itself is huge, which makes it quite noisy. I was here with a group of about 8 people, and it was very difficult to hear even the people directly across the table. For me, I felt like I spent more effort trying to enjoy myself than actually enjoying myself.

This is probably a better location for people with kids, or perhaps if you can get a little nook hidden in a corner somewhere.

Bottom line: Food was okay, atmosphere was okay. Service was okay. Nothing horrible. Nothing great.< /Text>

Great place to go for a Sunday brunch or a Saturday lunch. Sometimes it's a little crowded but it's a really big place so you'll usually get seated quickly. They have a neat little bar you can sit at if you want to but I suggest a table. It's right across from some construction but when the construction is done there's going to be a really cool park right outside so it will have that going for it< /Review>

You can spend a solid 100 dollars on a meal for two (if you order 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 3 drinks and a French press and dessert to share at the end) and it's worth every single penny. Get the Mary's chicken. Good American food</Review>

Great place for dinner. Great food with organic choices. Diverse wine list. Great staff. Can be a bit loud at tines. Always been an excellent experience.< /Text>

Hidden gem of Sonoma County.  Well run restaurant that has little staff turnover.  Might mean little on the surface, but this allows for a consistently great meal only ever outdone by the friendly and ever attentive staff. Great wine and beer selection run by one of the 2 best bartenders in our area.<//Text>

We found this place through Yelp and went there to check it out. It was on a Wednesday night and there was a street fair next to it, so it was bit more difficult to park. The restaurant was very busy, but they were still able to serve us without delay. The menu has plenty of options and we ended up both having a risotto. It was very delicious. The best thing of this restaurant is the cost-benefit. Our final bill was around $70 (no alcohol) and we had a wonderful dinner. Very cheap compared to most places in the wine country.< /Review>

Busy but a nice place, and the food is good. They have a full bar. On a busy night like Friday, they can be a little slow<//Text>

<review>Great meal; great service!  We held the rehearsal dinner for our son's wedding at Flavor last weekend.  They were prepared for 26 at the meal - but 38 showed up!  The staff accommodated us on a busy Saturday night without drama or complaint.

All the attendees were happy with their meals and the staff was able to handle the load with minimal disruption.

We are happy to report great food and great service for a very large party.  We have been to Flavor Bistro several times previously, and we have always enjoyed our meals and the great menu.  Lots of variety - there is something for everybody on their menu.< /review>< GmapID>

Very pleasant atmosphere if you sit in the front near the patio; otherwise the restaurant is so loud you can't hear your table companions.The food was very disappointing; we waited 45 minutes and when we inquired, the dishes were promptly brought to the table, leading us to think they had been sitting around. The lamb chops - ordered rare - were overcooked and c old. The solar and shrimp was tasty but also cold. We shared an apple tart that was all over kneaded, tough pastry w/little apple. We have been to Flavors many times and the eggplant park is, to us, the best dish (if a bit too tomatoey. This is definitely not the place for foodies but it's relaxed and, as noted, extremely pleasant if you're seated upfront.<//text>

I want to adore this place, but the food's inconsistency will not allow me.
Now, the atmosphere is fine, though it can get loud.
The hospitality is well above average and worth the visit.
They have the best wine program in Santa Rosa when you factor in value, selection and amount of choices, second in the county to LDV!
They are open late and a fine place for a half glass of wine and a bit after work anytime.<//Text>

I loved the food that my girlfriend and I got. The only service issue we encountered was coming during slow hours and so when we were readu to get the check, the waitress was nowhere to be found. We waited for a long time until I asked the server to make sure the server brings out check.

Ending on a positive note, it was raining outside and we were sat next to the fireplacr which was a lovely experience.< /text>

<username>Always 5 Star</username><date>1459465251097<//date><Rating>2</Rating><Text>When we first walked in I felt that I had walked into a café in Paris.  The first impression was appealing, the music and the décor spoke French.  Then it took a wrong turn.  We were seated alongside a table of a very large group (there was just two of us) and they were quite loud and rambunctious.  Then we were given the menu and it wasn’t French inspired at all.   It all seemed confusing as I thought the description said it was French cuisine.  As we ordered our food and hoped for the best, it just continued to be an unfortunate experience. Both our meals were not prepared well at all.  The food was plated well and looked like it would be very tasty.   After taking a couple of bites, we discovered that neither of our selections were good, we left the rest on the plate.  I am sorry to say that I cannot recommend this restaurant.  I am aware, that this is a favorite for many of their loyal customers as they were quite busy.  However, for me, I couldn’t understand why.<//Text>< pictures>

I found most of the food to be very one-dimensional, lacking the depth of flavor that takes food from okay to great. I had a caesar salad that lacked any rich, meaty anchovy flavor. The salad was small, despite being the "regular" size between small and large. I also had the pescatore, spaghetti with calamari, scallops, mussels, and shrimp. The sauce could have used more flavor, be it garlic, pepper, or literally anything. It was quite thin and tasted solely of tomato. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente, however, and the scallops were not a second overcooked. The shrimp was well flavored - I wish some of that had translated to the rest of the dish! The pasta could have used more seafood as well. While the mussels were plentiful, the shrimp, calamari, and scallop felt a bit stingy.

Overall, nothing special. It wasn't bad, but I'm not sure I'd come back with so many great places to eat in Wine Country.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>In all honesty, I only ended up at this restaurant because the vegan place next door was closing as we got there. We decided to give this place a shot, and saw that there were menu items explicitly mentioned as vegan (friendly). When we specified the items we wanted, and specified that we wanted the items to be vegan, the server changed tone and questioned us on why we would eat vegan. It was not a friendly inquisition, but more of a judgement on our lifestyle choices. O found this to be quite antagonistic and if I knew of other options nearby, I probably would have walked out then. I wanted to be civil but my dining partner made a more upset response. The server realised his wrongdoing and took a much more amicable approach from then forward but I couldn't feel comfortable around him any longer. Otherwise the food was decent, but not anything worth recommendation.</text><Name>James Bytelaar<//Name><Rating>2< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

Tastes like eating in Japan! Home cooking style restaurant specializing in Udon noodles done in broth and many other variations like Uni Cream Sauce!  Tasty nourishing dishes, very good happy hour.  Japanese craft beer, sake, wine, cooked bowls and teriyaki and sashimi and rolls.  Everything you need to feel well nourished. Nice mellow and attentive staff. Wish I lived in the neighborhood.<//review>

< Review>
This is my first time ever posting a google review, but I am doing so out of concern for those who may be interested in ordering from this restaurant.

My husband and I ordered KOCHI last night through postmates, an Udon soup and a beef rice bowl. It was tasty enough (though EXPENSIVE for what it was!!!). This morning we woke up to a rough bout of food poisoning. This is the first time I have had food poisoning in over two years. Sad to see restaurants in LA so highly reviewed and lauded (looking at you, The Infatuation) with such poor standards for food quality and safety. KOCHI, please do better for your future customers, but we won’t be among them.<//Review>

<review>Went to a show at the Largo, and had to quickly find a place nearby to grab dinner. We had zero expectations, and were blown away! The service was okay — they were very busy — but the food was incredible. We shared garlic edamame and each had udon. Can’t wait to go back.< /review>< Pictures>

Though service is a little slow, I really like the udon here! Fresh and perfectly chewy, it goes well in broth or dry.</Review>

This is a great place if you are crawing for udon.  The staff is very nice and friendly. Parking can be a bit tricky depending the time of the day. The place have a very calming vibe, the set meals are just the right portion. They have draft beer as well. Negitoro was fresh and very tasty. They have 2 udon options regular(softer) or fresh(more chewy).<//review>

Most amazing spicy tuna crispy rice I’ve ever had!!! They are always fresh, and melt in your mouth, I’m so shocked this place doesn’t have 1000 reviews! Kindest service !! Yellowtail was matsuisha standards!! Melted in my mouth :) so happy I now live closer !! Also the udon tempura soup is marvelous !! Honestly try everything :) and they are dog friendly 😘😘😘 love !!!! Iced green tea 🍵 <3< /text>

Some of the best Japanese noodles in LA. Simple small place with great service and tasty Japanese food. I really enjoyed it because it reminded me of eating at my mother in laws in Tokyo. Really authentic and tasty.<//text>

Great place for different types of udon!

Came here with a group of three and got many different types of udon among the three of us, and honestly loved all of them. I ended up getting the mentai cream udon and loved it. Really fresh and wonderful flavor with the mentai. Portions were also wonderful and just right!

Been here a couple times and have had good experiences.  The udon is very good and I've liked all of the appetizers and sides I've gotten so far as well.  I like the curry udon most, but their other traditional udon is good as well.  Their broth tends to be a little strong and maybe salty, but the menu says they can add extra dashi to tone it down (i don't).

Udon is great comfort food and I prefer it to ramen--I haven't been to too many places with decent udon, so I'm very happy I found Kochi!</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The fried chicken is delicious, it won’t be powdery, the mentaiko udon is also delicious, the sauce is very rich and rich, and the price is reasonable~

<date>1568520494759<//date><Pics>None<//Pics><Text>(Translated by Google) The clerk's ordering communication was not done well, and the attitude was very poor. The guest was directly rude and dropped from the back to the table. The evaluation of the restaurant was not flattering.

P.s things are pretty good to eat

(Original)
店員點餐溝通沒做好，態度非常差的質疑客人，送餐直接沒禮貌的從後面丟到桌上就走了，評價再高的餐廳面對這種服務也讓人不敢恭維

P.s 東西是還算不錯吃</Text></record>

Huge menu of yummy drinks and different add-ins, my favorite is of course the boba, coffee jelly, and mango jelly. All of their food options are  delicious too! The popcorn chicken is so good and a really large quantity for the price. The staff are nice and very quick. Definitely recommend this spot. You can find their menu online and place a phone order.<//Text>

Great drink, nice staff. I ordered the golden oolong tea with cheese cream. I like the tea they they brew right after ur order, it took longer than usual bubble tea place but worth the wait. The tea flavor is good and the cheese cream not covering the tea taste. Will surely come again.<//text>

Been going here since they opened. The staff never disappoint, always friendly. I recommend their popcorn chicken, fried mushrooms,  fried cheese sticks, and squid balls. Their boba is also good, my faves are thai tea, royal milk tea, house fruit tea, passion fruit green tea. The add on boba and rainbow jelly are the faves.</review>

Definitely my favorite boba shop. I go here almost every time with my friends, after a game, after a show, or just to hang out. The service can be a bit slow and tricky, but it never really stopped me from coming back again and again. If there's anything I know about this place, it's that the popcorn chicken there is absolutely worth the wait. The dining area is small, but it's never too crowded in the first place. I very much recommend.< /text>

Perfect place to hand out with friends. The milk tea here is to DIE for. During the pandemic, you're able to order via online, only downside, you need to come inside to order the popcorn chicken. (And let me tell you. 5$ for a whole bag of chicken?!?!?!?! Totally worth coming in.)</Review>

I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH. I love how many drink options they give you and the popcorn chicken and cheese sticks are a MUST and they give you a lot! They have games there to play with plus gasha machines, claw machine, and game machines! I’ve won a couple stuff from it, I just love it there! I get my drinks there like almost everyday I love this place and I’ve been coming here since I was a child, and they never fail me! My favorite order from this boba place is probably the rose milk tea 50% with add ons or either a earl gray with add ons. Or sometimes I would go with mango green tea.. their options are ENDLESS! But what I do wish for them to have is anything Matcha or Green Tea flavored. I hope they will put it into the menu one day because I love my matcha!! So in conclusion, stop by.. because I think it’s rlly good and I love it so much 🥺💖</review>

Very nice beverages! The staff working the front were a little awkward. One of them making a comment to a customer about how they can't make that many drinks at a time. The whole conversation was very awkward and I believe the staff member was just trying to make a joke, the other staff member had to diffuse the situation. Whatevs though. The inside is kinda meh looking, the table and chairs outside are eye sores.</Text>

You get plenty for the price, and it is always great.

Formosa Tea Time is not bad, but not spectacular. I think the appeal of this place (at least, for me) is that it is open until 11 PM, which is later than most other similar places in the area. The drinks are OK (they do have a diverse selection). There are board games here, but most of them aren't in good condition (though, it's passable). Service at the counter is low key, but that's fine. Seating is somewhat limited, as I think there are maybe three to four tables there from what I remember. Parking is plentiful, as I have never had to look hard for a spot in this plaza. Not a bad place to grab boba, tea, or a fruit drink, but I also wouldn't go out of my way. An OK option if you're in the area.< /Text>

Phenomenal. Excited to have found such a unique place. Immediately noticed how clean and friendly it was. The staff was very helpful with helping us try and choose the perfect flavor. Shocked to see how affordable it was for such high quality.</Text>

The teas, slushes, and coffees are great but the thing you really want to try is their homemade popcorn chicken. It is the most amazing texture of crisp breading with tender chicken. You can thank me later.</Text>

<text>This is definitely not my favorite boba place but it's not bad either. I really think this place is like lollicup. They have games and places to sit if you wanted to chill there which is cool. They also have a few arcade games in the back.

The service was great I came in maybe like 5 min before closing and they were still able make our drinks. They said they don't start closing until the store closes which is really cool because sometimes places are closed even before they close because they started closing work too early.

Anyways the prices are great so if you're looking for a good and cheap boba spot then this is it! They have free WiFi here too so it's perfect for those who want to do work there. I really hope this place improves if they do I believe they will have a lot of potential.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dd29c3fa592595:0x6f97a95675d3f47b</Gmap_id>< response>

Formosa is an average boba place. Nothing special but nothing really bad. Decor is a bit weird not really matching the store. The food takes a bit long to come out but smells great. The boba is good but this place isn't popular for a small reason.

There wifi sucks I tried to load YouTube videos and at times it struggled to meet the buffering demand of 480p. I believe it's being throttled or their router is poor. If their internet was better maybe this place would be more popular with the young crowd looking to do school work. I would suggest not coming here to study sadly. Don't offer free wifi that isn't good it only makes the business feel bad.</review>

They've raised the prices so expect to pay $10+ per person if you want a drink AND a snack. The popcorn chicken is really good but sometimes I feel like it's too much skin and fat. I ordered a corn dog one time and the middle was oozing with raw batter. Horrible cooking practices.</text>

Okay. Everyone NEEDS to try that place else. They have free wifi. They have gaming machines. They have board games. They have many different drink flavors. They have food of course. Seriously. Just try that place out.</Text>

First time that I am writing a review because this is extremely important for everyone to be aware when ordering popcorn chicken here.

Note that it was my first (and last) time coming here since we were in the area. My family is big boba and popcorn chicken fans but we've always opted for the bigger boba chains like Lollicup, Class 302 or Tastea.

I waited about 20 minutes for the popcorn chicken. That's pretty long wait for a popcorn chicken... usually a 5 minute wait at Class 302 because it is already cooked and just a re-fry or re-heat or whatever they needed to do. So I was wondering what was taking sooo long.

I have 2 little kids. I gave a small piece my y.o. and before I gave one to my other kid, I cut in half and saw inside was raw!!! I was shocked. I checked a few more and they were all raw. As I'm writing this review I wished I had taken a pic before I returned and told the store how uncooked the chicken was. I don't care about the refund or whatever but I told them how bad it is to serve raw chicken. I was so sorry to my kid for not checking his food first before giving it to him. But it is definitely a lesson learned to check food first and to avoid small chains to be on the safe side.

There was a nearby kfc and just got popcorn nuggets there. It tasted commercial but hey it's cooked!!!< /Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><review>Located in a large shopping plaza next to TMobile, ample parking. Spacious inside with about 8-9 tables inside. Ambiance is great inside, full blast air conditioning on a warm day, to a point where I felt cold. Super friendly staff members. I asked for the restroom key many times and no one hurried me out after being here for almost 2 hours.

My drink of honey green milk tea with boba, no ice, 25% sweet lacked flavor, The green tea flavor definitely present, but lacked a "kick." Perhaps it could be that I got it with too less sugar. I tried the almond milk tea with boba, 100% sweet and to me that was too sweet.

I'm willing to try them again.</review>< Pics>

Amazing experience! I had my maternity photos at Vasona Park and even had my dog in them :) . He has a great location list to chose from! Every single photo came out better than I thought. Of course I was nervous of what they would come out like but after seeing them, I was overwhelmed with JOY. He knows how to capture each moment perfectly and helped us feel most comfortable with every shot. Almost felt as if a friend were taking pictures of us instead of a stranger. I can't exaggerate how happy and satisfied we are with the photos! Almost cried with how dang cute these are <3< /review>

My husband and I had maternity photos and newborn photos done with Steven, and both sessions were amazing! Steven makes the sessions really easy and fun, and he did a great job capturing natural looks. He is very professional and his photo turnaround time was quick. I highly recommend Steven for all your portrait needs!</review>

<Review>I mean there is a reason for all 5 stars review for Steven. They are all real :)

I had a smooth booking to photoshoot experience and the pics came out fabulous. Steven is amazing to work with and has a great eye for flattering photos and location!

Our family portraits was just wow! Thanks Steven. One suggestion is that it is hard to reach you sometimes over phone or email, I understand you are busy but replying to emails shouldn't take that much time :)</Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Steven took pictures for our baby shower event and we are very happy with both - working with him & the quality (& quantity) of pictures that were delivered. Right from initial email to booking to photography on the day of event and delivering images, Steven was right on spot - professional and responsive.

Steven took a lot of quality pictures - including lot of candid ones. On the day of the event he came early to take a look around and started taking pictures right on time. He covered all the guests (65+) who attended the event and took nice pictures of them. He was kind enough to stay for 10-15 mins extra to take some last minute pictures.

He's very quick when taking pictures (he usually delivers more pictures than promised) & carries some toy-like camera attachments to ensure kids also give attention when taking a picture. He always wears a smile and is very attentive to ensure all requests for pics are taken care of. He's fantastic as a person - friendly, humble, soft spoken. Thank you Steven for making our baby shower event memorable.</Review>

<text>We are returned customers of Steven Cotton Photography - he took our engagement pics a few years ago and now our maternity photos. There's a reason we always come back to him and will keep doing so because Steven is truly an awesome photographer to work with.

He's very familiar with best spots and the best time to take pics (golden hour for maternity photos right before sunset) and is very good at engaging us throughout the 1-hour session (asking us questions from time to time and getting that candid moments with laughter). We are very satisfied with all the pics he's taken and they all have these warm and glowy feelings attached to these portraits.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>We had an amazing maternity photoshoot experience with Steven. From booking the session to delivering the pictures, the entire process was straightforward and well-organized. We filled a simple questionnaire before the shoot to help him understand our likes/preferences and were given detailed instructions on the meeting location and time. Taking care of these little details in just a couple of emails made the experience really smooth for us.

In spite of this being our first professional candid photoshoot, we felt very comfortable and the best thing about working with Steven was the casual conversations which made it an ease for us during the photo shoot. All this inevitably reflects beautifully in the pictures. He was very familiar with the location and was able to quickly transition from one good spot to another and that helped to take pictures with different backgrounds/sceneries in a short amount of time.

We received the pictures really quickly and were pleasantly surprised with the number of pictures and above all, they were just amazing!<//text><UserId.>112542147928212731790< /UserId.>< Pics>

My wife and I had our maternity photos taken by Steven at Vasona Park. We are so happy with the way they turned out. The lighting was perfect and so many precious moments were captured. We especially appreciated the guidance that Steven gave us when taking the photos as we are not used to posing for pictures! We highly recommend Steven Cotton Photography to capture your special moments :)<//text>

Steven is AMAZING!!! We have already used him for two family photo shoots and are planning 2 more (we have many family combos). Steven was professional, accommodating for requests of different photos, and was helpful to capture great shots of everyone!!! Especially our 19 month old. He provides helpful guidance on posing and how to get toddlers smiling, without being intrusive. He follows proper Covid-19 social distancing protocols. His website is straightforward and is easy to book through. Steven is a joy to work with and we are so thankful we found him!< /review>

Steven has a very warm and welcoming personality, and is a wonderful photographer to work with. I have had 3 family sessions with him already, and will keep coming back to him for my future sessions without a second thought.

Highly recommend Steven Cotton Photography!</Review>

We booked Steven Cotton Photography for a family photoshoot. Steven was great and was not even phased by having 5 kids (crying & very energetic) and 11 adults. Steven captured the family perfectly. He got some great shots and we were able to get so many photos and different arrangements within the 1 hour of shooting. Steven was so calm and patient. Thank you for helping us freeze time by capturing these amazing photos.</review>

Steven cotton Review

My family had a wonderful experience with Steven for our family portraits recently. I loved how he was so easy to talk to and my kids felt the same. We got some beautiful pictures of the kids because he was chatting and connecting with them. I also didn’t feel rushed at all during our hour long shoot.
We thoroughly enjoyed our ‘first’ family picture session in California and I am glad we chose to go with Steven.< /Review>

My husband and I were looking for a professional photographer to capture pictures of our intimate wedding on November 5th. We stumbled on Steven's name on Google and were really impressed with the quality of the reviews his previous customers had given him. We can only echo to all the great feedback he has and cannot recommend him enough.
Throughout our session Steven was very calm, friendly and thoughtful.
The quality of the pictures is impressive and Steven was very responsive, patient and put us at ease to take great shots.
He made sure to diligently walk us through the process with cute couple games and questions.
We will definitely employ his services again!<//Text>

We hired Steven to photograph our intimate wedding in 8/2020. I cannot recommend him highly enough - he was perfect at every step of the way! Prior to the event, we had a conversation about our needs and he was a great listener and very understanding. He also made an extra trip to scope out the location, and was able to suggest some minor changes that ended up making the photos gorgeous.
At the event itself, he was incredibly organized, patient, and best of all - gave us great suggestions for candid photos. During our ceremony I barely noticed he was there, but I now see we have several beautiful pictures of those precious moments. I keep looking back at the album and marveling at how lovely it all turned out! I know we will enjoy these photos for decades to come, and cannot wait to enjoy them with our future family.
Overall, Steven is kind, professional, talented and just captures high quality, beautiful photos. He made everyone look spectacular! I've been in the wedding party for a few SF & LA weddings, and think he's the best photographer I've encountered so far. I would love to hire him again for any photography needs!</Review>

We had the pleasure of having Steven as our Photographer for our wedding day and it was an absolute pleasure. Not only was Steven detailed oriented - by walking us through how the day and how the shots will look like -  he went above and beyond for us in many ways. First, because we didn't have a videographer, Steven offered to capture the important moments for us - including the vows and the first dance. Steven also brought on additional photographers to help capture the side angles, which were wonderful. Lastly, Steven was so pleasant to be around and our family loved him. He was by far our best wedding vendor to work with.</review>

I took my senior portraits with Steven after seeing some of his (awesome) reviews and looking at his pictures. He did such an amazing job! I have zero idea what to do in front of a camera, but he made sure I felt comfortable. All the pictures turned out amazing! My aunt even said that he managed to "capture [my] essence," which I think is pretty awesome! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to take their senior photos!<//Text>

Steven does a fantastic job as a photographer!  It is not easy to get 6 children's attention while photographing, and he comes prepared with gadgets that will help get their attention, which is not easy to do.  Steven pays close attention to detail and is very patient with all of us and our mix of personalities! :)  I highly recommend his services and hope you enjoy his work as much as our family does! We have used his services for many years and plan to continue doing so.  Thank you Steven for your hard work and talent!</Review>

Steve took extra time to make sure we are comfortable during the session. He was especially patient with our 4 year old. His vision for portraits is next to none. He would go above and beyond to accommodate your needs. Highly recommend !! Looking forward to more shoots in future.< /text>

We had a great time during maternity photoshoot with Steven. He was punctual, had great suggestions and very accommodating of our requests with different props and poses. He made sure to click lots of great pictures and provided almost 50+ edited pictures within a week.

It was an amazing experience and would like to work with him again!<//Review>

Steven was very patient with a cranky 11 month old and was so easy to talk to and tell him what exactly we wanted.

Steven does 5-star work and he is personally a so-many-star artist. We had our maternity photo session with him few months ago. We loved his work so much, so recently we worked with him for having great pictures with our bundle of joy.
Steven is friendly and professional, and working with him is fun. He delivers 5-star works. I highly recommend him and I look forward to working with him again.< /Review>

I cannot rave enough about my experience with Steven! I had the pleasure of having him capture my headshots and they are not only stunning but he made the whole experience a delight. Our original shoot date was back in March but unfortunately because of COVID, I felt more comfortable rescheduling to a later date. Steven was so understanding and flexible and I really appreciated his professionalism and timely response to my emails. Steven is so personable and although I can get a little uncomfortable in front of a camera, he helped me feel at ease and it definitely shows in the photos. The photos were delivered so quickly and it was so hard to choose one headshot since all the options he sent over were beautiful! I highly recommend working with Steven if you are looking to update your headshots.</review>

We worked with Steven to take our holiday photos, and he was responsive, detailed, and easy to work with. We have a young puppy, and Steven helped us with him as well, and got our pup to look at the camera for a lot of the photos. The turnaround was just as communicated by Steven, and they were vibrant, candid, and personal. We highly recommend him in the San Jose area!</Text>

What a fantastic experience! From start to finish, the process of getting family portraits was effortless and fun. We ended up with dozens of quality, authentic photos to choose from, where we look like ourselves but from the eye of a super talented professional. Steven is thorough with communication, effortless to book and have questions answered, fun to work with, and sooo talented!! Highly recommend.<//review>

<Text>We loved Steven's style as exhibited in his portfolio and reached out to him for our maternity shoot. In all of our interactions with him leading up to booking the date and after, he responded promptly. We fixed a date to take photos in Vasona Lake Park. However, as the air quality was pretty bad on the day, Steven reached out to us himself and helped us reschedule the shoot for a later date. On the day of the shoot, he had some tricks up his sleeve to shoot both posed and candid photos of the two of us. He committed to getting us the final photos within a week and we absolutely LOVED the final product. We would highly recommend working with Steven and hope to reach out to him again once our little one arrives.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>We hired Steven for an outdoor family photoshoot and we just loved the experience. He was very fun to work with. Steven followed all Covid protocols and was very professional. He went out of the way to make our 10 month old smile for all the pictures. We are not great posers, thanks to Steven, the images turned out so beautiful. He definitely gave us images. that we would preserve for a long time. I would love to hire him for all future photography needs.< /Review>< Pics>

We recently did our Maternity Photoshoot with Steven and will have to say it was an enriching experience. Steven has complete knowledge and understanding of what he is trying to do and he keeps us engaged through out the process. He makes sure he gets the best angle and expression for the shot. He is also very good with kids and makes sure everyone has fun in the process. We really loved the photos and will cherish it for a very long time. Thanks Steven!</review>

We loved loved loved our photos. I was worried that 30 minutes would not be enough for a maternity shoot.  But Steven did a great job at making us feel comfortable from the beginning. For example, he had us tell each other cute things right before he took photos. The result was natural looking photographs. He also has a really nice energy and was open about his experience being a father, so it made us feel like we were with a friend.  We also received a lot more photos than the expected 25 and we also got them really fast (i think it was within 3 days). Definitely hire him.</Review>

We did our Maternity photoshoot with Steven and this was our 1st photoshoot by a professional photographer. The whole photography session was amazing. He was very responsive to my emails and was in the venue before time. He makes you feel comfortable, confident and keep you engaged and creates moment where you can fall in love again. Me and my wife just enjoyed the whole session and I think the price is worth it. So 200% recommended. Thanks Steve. The photos came out amazing.</Text>

< review>
We had a great experience taking maternity photos with Steven. Before the session, he offered us a choice of locations and had us fill out a client's questionnaire to better understand our preferences. During the session, he suggested certain poses but also was creative in getting candid shots. For example, he had my husband and I talk about a certain topic and took photos from farther away, for more spontaneous photos. Steven offered more photos with the 1-hour maternity package than many other photographers, and we received our photos within a week of the session. We highly recommend Steven!</review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>This is our 3rd booked session with Steven, his work has always been amazing! Booking online with him has been hassle-free, it's easy and he provides you lots of useful information before the photoshoot. We did a mini family session this time and he worked so well with my 4 yr old toddler, making the session lots of fun and very personal.
The turn around was quick and I was very pleased with all the images he captured. It was truly a wonderful experience and those pictures says it all!

Looking forward to our next session and we want to thank you for making this holiday photo session special!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Steven gave us some guidance before and during the session that was really helpful since we're really bad at making poses in front of the camera. We love the photos very much as everything look so nice and natural! We're looking forward to having newborn portrait session with Steven when our little girl is here. Thank you so much Steven! We really had a great time :)< /text>< pics>

<text>We were very impressed with Steven’s services. Steven did an excellent job of communicating what to expect during the photo shoot (explaining his approaches and the rationale behind them prior to the event). He also sent very helpful tips for preparing for the photo shoot -- including tips for what to wear and great strategies for getting young children excited about and engaged in the event (we have a 6- and 3-year old – so this was great!). Steven was very responsive to emails and very clear and straightforward about everything. During the event, Steven was especially patient and creative when our 3-year-old initially did not want to have anything to do with getting pictures taken. Steven went well beyond the time frame we had paid for and succeeded in getting smiles and laughter out of our 3-year old (and the rest of the family!). The images he provided us were beautiful – very creative and natural. He also went above and beyond the minimum number of online images that come with the package we purchased. We would definitely recommend Steven Cotton Photography and will be sure call on him again for our next photo session: ).</text>< Pics>

We absolutely love Stevens photos. He has captured some great memories of our children and family. His website is easy to navigate and it's super easy to book your appointment. You get several emails with communication  of what to expect  before your photoshoot. I highly recommend Steven cotton photography.</Review>

Our family had such a wonderful time with Steve. He’s very knowledgeable and advised on the best time to capture the most beautiful sunlight. Steve has the gifts to make our entire family laugh. The kids loved the entire photo session. The photos turned out beautiful and they touched all of our hearts.  We learned Steve is a loving father himself. We highly recommend Steve to capture the important moments in your life.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>We had Steven take our portraits on two separate occasions - pregnancy portraits and family portraits with our baby for the first birthday. It was very easy to reach out to Steven for an appointment. He was very prompt in responding with his availability and recommendations for outdoor venues appropriate for each session. On the day of the appointment, he turned up ahead of time to the session. Based on the occasion, Steven suggests some great ideas for capturing very natural photos. He makes even the most camera shy person feel comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed both our portrait sessions. Lastly, he's very prompt in releasing the final images within 3-5 days and the pictures look fantastic every time! We love them so much that we've framed quite a few of the pictures. We will not hesitate to work with Steven for other special occasions in the future! Thank you for capturing our family's special memories Steven.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I've used a lot of photographers and Steven has been my favorite and my new go-to photographer! Before the session, he sent multiple emails to help prep. He was great with my almost 3 year old and captured some of my favorite pictures. He was very professional and made us feel really comfortable. We will definitely be booking him more in the future!<//Review>

We had a fantastic experience working with Steven for our family portrait. He gave us tips and tricks to make our little man smile, who had just gotten up from a broken nap and was in no mood to smile. Steven is very friendly which made us feel relaxed throughout the session. We very much loved all the pictures he took. We wouldn't look any further for a photographer going forward.</text>

Our family of mostly introverts had so much fun during the photoshoot. Steven gave us much-needed direction and tips for getting the kids to smile. He made us feel comfortable and relaxed. He made sure to take all the combinations of our large group and even took gorgeous solo portraits of the kids. The hour flew by! We got lots of beautiful photos and turnaround was really quick.  Highly recommend booking a session with him.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This is my fourth family portrait session with Steven Cotton. Again, we are blown away with the quality/quantity of photos, ease of photography session, and overall experience! Working with Steven has been super easy! He's responsive via email and very accommodating with my requests. Taking family portraits with a baby and toddler is no easy feat, but Steven made it super painless (and rather enjoyable!) He even tried various ways to get my kids to smile!
I cannot say enough good things about Steven. He's friendly, easy-going, and makes sure you're always comfortable. He's our go-to photographer every year. We look forward to our next family photo session in the future.

<Time>1563070614867<//Time><review>Steven has shot our family over the years - from maternity shots to extended family portrait sessions. He is super easy to work with- scheduling is a breeze, he shoots in multiple locations around the Bay Area and he is so generous with his time and goes above and beyond in make sure he has captured every possible combination (especially hard with large groups). And most importantly, his photos come out gorgeous. We love working with him and will continue to do so.</review><userid>112632469779410231436</userid><username>Mini Thangagaswamy< /username></record>

We had a great family photography session with Steven. I have 2 kids (1 and 4 year old) and Steven did a great job at keeping them happy and collaborative during the photoshoot. We arrived a little bit late because we had difficulty finding the exact spot but Steven was patiently waiting and made us feel very comfortable right away. He didn't make us feel rushed and spent plenty of time taking different shots and poses. Steven is very pleasant person and I think anyone can immediately feel comfortable with him. The photos were processed and received in a few days only just as promised and they were absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend Steven.<//Review>

<Review>Steven has been taking family photos for us since I was pregnant with my first child. I know have two kids and he has helped us to capture so many amazing moments in the past four years. He is very easy to work with, reliable, talented, and reasonable in terms of pricing/number of pictures that he provides. He is also very flexible and is willing to meet at different spots in and around San Jose. I would definitely recommend!</Review>< GmapID>

My sister recommended Steven for this as she has been using his amazing services for annual family portraits. Their photos always turn out amazing, so I had no doubt Steven would deliver.

Not only did Steven produce amazing photos, he was able to find moments throughout the party that I didn't even know happened! He blended right into the attendees and never made any scene to stage a shot. Everything was smooth and easy! I so very much appreciate his self direction, knowing I was otherwise mentally occupied in entertaining guests, Steven jumped right in and collected wonderful memories that will be cherished for years to come.

He’s reliable, very personable, he’s accommodating. Everything. We love Steven and he’s gotten to know our family so well! Maternity shoots (x2), baptism, baby showers, engagement, wedding, annual family photos for the past few years. He’s stuck with us!!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

My experience with Steven Cotton Photography was fantastic! Steven is a very cordial and personable young man with outstanding photography skills. I was extremely pleased and satisfied with my finished photos and the variety of poses that he was able to successfully obtain in a beautiful outdoor setting. His prices are reasonable and he makes you feel "at home" during the photography session. I plan to continue using Steven as my photographer. I would recommend him to anyone anywhere!<//text>

Steven was great! We were working with short notice for an event and he responded promptly, showed up on time, and delivered fantastic photos. I would use him again for future events.</text>

Can't say enough positive things!!!

Before we picked our photographer, we had a long list of concerns, wishes, and things we wanted to make sure were "just right," so it was hard to find and commit to one photographer, but I can say without any shadow of a doubt that we're very grateful we picked Steven.

We scheduled a maternity photo shoot with him, and we chose Stanford University as our shooting location, since it was located close to where we live and had significant sentimental value. Throughout the whole process, he was extremely helpful and professional, knew exactly what would make good background shots, and worked with our requests. The end results were beyond what we could have hoped for.

Was able to even get some professional head shots done at the very end, which finally gave my LinkedIn a much needed refresher! Was also by far the best professional headshot I've ever had in my years with a professional online presence.

On top of all that, his customer service was second to none, responding to my emails immediately, even into the latest hours on Sunday.

One again, can't say enough about how happy we are that we worked with Steven, and I'm sure we'll be booking him again for other major life events that we'll be having.</Review>

Steven took some pictures of our now one year old and a few family shots. The pictures turned out great! It's hard to pick which ones to print. He is very personable and patient with kids. We were at a park and my son was distracted by everything but Steven still managed to capture his attention and get some really sweet pictures! We also used him for newborn pictures a year ago.<//review>

He is an amazing photographer. I got 60 min session with him and was little worried about the time. But Steven is patient and very quick with his tools.< /Text>

We are so INCREDIBLY happy with our photos! Steven was everything we hoped for and needed in a photographer -- punctual, patient, personable and (ph)ull of ideas! Our shoot included two children, a pup, and parents... needless to say we needed someone who wasn't afraid to direct but also encourage! We would definitely recommend his services. He'll for sure be my go to cameraman from here on out! Added bonus: we got our photos (lots of them) a couple days after the shoot!< /review>

We utilized Steven's photography skills this past weekend for family photos.  Even though my son and I were dreading this yearly experience, my wife put down her foot.  She contacted Steven, and he suggested a location by the Santa Teresa hills.
Steven was very professional and made my family at ease with his easy going personality.  With an energetic 2 1/2 yr old, Steven was patient , and able to get her attention.  We went through a variety of poses with our two kids, and changed backgrounds a few times also.  The pics came out fantastic, and my wife was very pleased.  Steven also provided us with a CD of the pics.
I would highly recommend Steven's photography services to everyone!<//Review>

We had an excellent experience with Steven Cotton for our newborn photo shoot. He was accommodating, professional, and skilled with working with newborn/infants. The photos turned out great and we would definitely be interested in working with him again.</Text>

My family just did our first family photo shoot with Steven and we couldn't be happier with the results. The shoot was with my husband, my one year old daughter, and myself at Vasona Park in Los Gatos. Steven knew exactly which locations had the best lighting for the time of day and was incredibly fast at capturing wonderful shots (crucial with a one year old). He was very professional and the results are amazing. He even delivered the shots within a few days after the shoot! We love all of the pictures! He was able to capture so many great shots with our family. Highly recommend using Steven for your family photo shoot needs. Thanks for the great service and pictures!<//Text>

<Text>Steven is an awesome photographer, takes high quality photos, and captures every moment perfectly. I had booked Steven in 2017 for a maternity photoshoot and again two years later for my second maternity photoshoot which was last weekend. I just received the photos and I have zero complaints. I was nervous that there might not be great photos because my two year old son was all over the place during the session, at times photobombing as well. But I am sooo glad that there are still soooo many great photos. I highly recommend Steven Photography, I will book a session with Steven again and again for all my photography needs in the future. Thank you, Steven!<//Text><user_id>117986884663707721811<//user_id>< Response>

Great zoo for a fairly quick walkthrough. Animals are well taken care. The only aspect that would have made this a 5 star would be if they offered food and had more interactive activities for the kids.<//review>

<Review>Our kids love going to this park. Love going to the zoo or library and stopping by the playground after.
Downside is lately we have noticed people have been sleeping in the park and it’s not as clean as it use to be.< /Review><user_id>117611853372398088255</user_id><Rate>4< /Rate>< user_name>

I love this park. after 3 the homeless crowd gets too sloppy and it makes it uncomfortable for a mother with a lot of children to stay and play. So I recommend going early while its busier with other parents and park staff<//Review>

Beautiful park with two playgrounds and lots of picnic tables. There is a lot of bird poop from the peacocks on the sidewalk though. My kiddos really enjoyed the western themed play structure and it was handy that it was so close to the animal sanctuary! The bathrooms are a bit far away for my liking as we have a 4 year old who waits until the last second to tell us when he needs to go, but we had a lot of fun hanging out here.<//review>

One of the best parks in Folsom. Plus its near the Folsom library and Folsom zoo. Awesome place to walk and have fun with kids. Bad that during quarantine, lots of homeless people made it their home. The city has done nothing in this sence.</Review>

I brought my granddaughter here with my daughter a couple of weeks ago and we had a great time! This is a sanctuary for wild animals so it's not necessarily a typical zoo... It's a much smaller version in a regular neighborhood that is attached to a park with a playground.

There are all kinds of animals including bears and tigers and monkeys and birds... If you want a fun day with your kids... This is the place to go!< /Review>

<Review>Great place to bring the family on a Saturday. There are large play structures for any age and if the kids get tired of playing they can head into the library for ice cream. Then finish your visit with a stop at the zoo. Three great locations all in one place.< /Review>< Pictures>

It's small and kid friendly and about the 3rd of the cost as the sac zoo.   Go early because the animals will hide if warm.  The best thing is it has native to California animals.</review>

Great parks that are the exit of the Folsom city zoo sanctuary. There are a few transients there now and then but overall a great way to spend an hour or so. And, walking distance to the library!<//text>

<date>1523147140524</date><rating>5<//rating><review>This is such a nice zoo.  The people are all so nice & helpful that work here.  It's a small zoo but it's quite & peaceful.  The deer, wolf, & bear sanctuaries are awesome.  The tigers sanctuary is small but it has back passages to roam.  The peacocks are hilarious, they just roam free & you can go right up & touch them.  Try it out for a quick visit.</review>< Pics>

Great little zoo, especially for younger kids who may not have the stamina for a huge zoo. Also a great park next door. Perfect activity for a morning or afternoon.< /text>

Could be a nice place, but it is kind of run down and not well maintained. Equipment left out, things laying around, that kind of thing. Animals do look healthy though.< /review>

<Review>We visited on Saturday afternoon, May 5, 2018.  I am disabled and was using a mobility scooter.  The access was extremely good.   My husband, son and I enjoyed the sanctuary very much, especially the habitat for the tiger, bear and black tailed deer.  The cleanliness was also exceptional.   Great entrance price also.  Fun.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>This is def a great and fun place to spend some time.  The peacocks mingle. Toddlers can almost but not quite catch the roosters and chickens nearby. The two playgrounds are age appropriate with lots of shade for parents. Access to quick easy walking trails. Library fields train.  This park and zoo is a big part of what makes Folsom...

This place beats Sac Zoo by a long shot. The animals were actually in their habitats, and relatively easy to spot. I also loved that it's a sanctuary.<//review>< rating>

Great for kids, not too big but big enough for a 30 minute walk. It was a hot day today and not many of the animals were active. If we go again I would go as early as possible to see more animals for the kids and to avoid any crowds. Great zoo for a small town. Lots of staff around with exhibits.< /text>

<date>1561036570816<//date><rating>3</rating><Review>Went on a guided field trip with kindergarten class. The guides were VERY sharp with the children and inconsiderate of their young age. Although the groups were broken up, I witnessed on two occasions, chaperones and teachers having to stand up for the children when the guides were shaming them. Who knows what more could have happened that I was not witness to. It was disappointing. I would suggest visiting the zoo on your own, and not using the guided tours.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Great place for the whole family. There's a zoo, library, train ride, and jungle gym. Our family spent close to a whole day here, and we could have stayed longer. The zoo is small, but overall the park and all that's available are not too shabby.<//Review>

<Review>It was a pretty day, and we went to the park to work on crafts.  We needed a little electricity to finish the projects, but tge electrical outlets weren't working.  It may be something that would have been turned on if we had called the Parks Dept.  Not sure hiw it works.</Review><Name>shirley sojka<//Name>< Date>

<Text>Very nice park with two playgrounds, a baseball diamond and a small kids train along with soccer fields on the lower park area. It is right next to the Folsom Zoo and Library. Several events are put on in or near the park including the Folsom Rodeo, the Folsom Renissance Faire and Folsom food trucks. In addition, it is very near Old Folsom as well as several stores and eateries.<//Text>< Rating>

The rennfaire held here as well as the sanctuary zoo is all heart and easily seen as labors of love though...much smaller then I had been lead to believe. As well as the VERY large problem of only booking one vendor with mead, hard cider, ale and/or wine and that booth running out before noon on sunday! What does that make it? A dry faire. (Besides piss beers, no offence to Budwiser or Coors drinkers) And no one likes a dry faire. For shame.</text>

(Translated by Google) A great place to stay with children. They ride a little train nearby.

(Translated by Google) It is a park adjacent to the zoo.
The playground equipment is for elementary school students, but there are sandboxes and swings so even small children can play.
There is a small train for children, so I would like to see it next time

動物園に隣接した公園です。
遊具は小学生向けのものですが、砂場やブランコがあるので小さい子供でも遊べます。
子供向けの小さな汽車があるので、今度乗って見たいと思います<//Review>
