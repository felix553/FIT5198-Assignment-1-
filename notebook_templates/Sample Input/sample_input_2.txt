Ordered for delivery. Estimated an hour wait. Arrived within 45min. Courteous delivery driver as well. The pizza and wings we ordered were all delicious! A very good experience all around.<//Review>

Wow! What a great experience ordering from this location. They were very nice and the young lady that took my order did something very special for me that I asked her to do which was write I Love You for my girlfriend who I was ordering the pizza for. She loved it! Thanks Papa Johns on White Ln. Bakersfield, Ca.< /Text>

Great service. I forgot that I didn't order cheese on my pizza, but thankfully the delivery driver reached into his pocket and had a handful of those little mozzarella cheese cubes. 10/10 will order again.</text>

MY PIZZA HAD SO MANY CHEESES ON IT!  I called to complain but stood corrected. The toppings were hidden under the cheeses.  Best delivery pizza I've  had in a very long time. Prompt, hot, delicious,  what more could I say.

SUPERB!</review>

<review>This place is small but the employees make it worth it. The pizza is freshly made from quality ingredients. Sometimes, you can even watch them toss the dough in the air like you see in movies. The staff always works to get you the best deal possible and they are super friendly.<//review><Time>1507874600862<//Time><Name>The Artistic Foodie< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My order was completed and paid for online only for me to be called 2 minutes later and told it could not be fulfilled due to lack of management and staff shortage. I was told I will get a refund in 24 to 48 hours. Guess my kids will eat in 24 to 48 hours. This is absolutely ridiculous. And I used to love Papa Johns but I will never, ever spend another dollar with this establishment. Pure disgrace and poor customer service</Text>< name>

<Review>IT WAS ALRIGHT, BUT THEY SHOW THAT IT WAS $12.00 ON TV AND EVEN ON THIER SIGN WHEN YOU WALK IN, YET THEY CHARGED ME 12.99 PLUS TAX, THE PIZZA BARELY HAD ENOUGH SAUCE, WHICH I ASKED FOR EXTRA, THEN THE PEPPERONI WAS NOT SOLID ON THE WHOLE PIZZA LIKE IT SHOWS,  NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL, SO VERY SAD.

I got there and they didnt it have it ready . People would walk in after me and they would have there oizza ready. Ended up leaving there till 7:15pm.
There are better places in town anyways no need to go back.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Large pizza was a medium or a small anywhere else. Price was ridiculous for what we received. Pizza tastes about as good as little ceasars with a price of rusty's. Will not return.</Review>< user_name>

< review>
Every time I have visited this store I have had issues. Pizza is never ready when they say it is going to be (always have to wait 20+ minutes past when it says it will be ready), they have messed up pizzas before and say it will take another 20 minutes to make a new one, they forget to have the whole order together. I wouldn't recommend the store to anyone. I'm going to start driving to Rosedale and see if I get any better service<//review>

<Review>Really bad experience the past 3 times out of 4 ordering from here.... The last or most recent time, I ordered 32$ of food and had 40$. I handed the money to the driver after the pizza was over a hour and 25 minutes past the 30 minutes it usually takes to deliver, but after I handed the guy the money, I ask for just 5$ back, he says NO, my boss didn't give me change... And runs to his car and leaves..   WOW... I WANT THIS FIXED, I call the manager on shift, he States the driver is mentally handicapped, and has him appologize, but there's nothing they can do to make this right, my neighbors cam outside because it's 10 at night and this guy's in his car on the phone screaming like a kid... And in all this is the second time they have forgot items in my order and keep telling me they will add them on the next order... SMH<//Review>< Pics>

No matter where you go Papa John's is consistently good. The workers are friendly and I love that you can watch them flip dough, like pizza should be done.</review>

They send a coupon in the mail and I am unable to place order online because I'm not in delivery range (2.9 miles away).  We call and they say they deliver up to 5 miles but then will not honor the coupon that they sent me in the mail.< /Text>

We are SO LUCKY to have this business in our community. I have been taking my autos to Paso Robles Auto Repair for years. Each and every time they have made repairs at a proper cost and without issue. What really makes them stand out above the rest is their integrity. They have the skills and equipment to do a correct diagnosis and then make the correct and only repair needed. I never need to concern myself with unnecessary repairs from this amazing team of people.

Thank you so much Paso Robles Auto Repair, I'll see you next time.<//review>

We were only in Paso for a few days and our CRV’s air conditioning  went out.    Lalo was so awesome to see us last minute on Good Friday!  Not knowing if it needed a recharge or compressor he took a look and unfortunately it’s a compressor.  We plan to take care of it when we get home but he didn’t even charge us to look at it!!   Everyone was super super nice.  Thank you so much</review>

<review>I cannot speak highly enough for Lalo and his team at Paso Auto Repair. They are professional, very courteous and understanding of the customers needs. I had the entire front end of my 2005 Ford F150 repaired, including the cam phasers, timing mechanism and sprockets. I also had service of the rear differential and replacement of rear brakes and rotors. The work was perfect and the price was fair. I recommend anyone that needs engine work to come see them. Thank you guys!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80ecc56bd86d4b75:0xa9e2a577ebba1dde</gmapID></record>

Helped me get a last minute oil change and inspection while on a road trip. They topped off all my fluids and pointed out a couple things I should get fixed, but unlike other auto shops, not once did I feel like I was going to get ripped off! It seemed like they genuinely wanted to best for me. If I’m ever in the area and need work on my car I would definitely go there again.< /text>< pics>

Excellent quick service
In addition to oil change they do entire vehicle safety inspection
They balance each tire with a rotation instead of just moving the tires around
Will definitely return!<//Text>

Problem diagnosed and engine tested with a proposed solution by Friday afternoon. They even found a potential problem that I wasn't aware of. I authorized the repairs on Friday afternoon right before closing time. Monday morning Isaac calls with an additional recommended repair at a very reasonable price. 1:30 pm on Monday (after they're closed all weekend) they call - car ready to go, test driven, engine completely tested. Intake Manifold, serpentine belt, spark plugs all replaced. Cooling system pressure tested. Unbelievable. Throughout the process they took the time to explain the recommended repairs, parts, etc. Honest, fast, quality repair work done by guys who know their stuff and who'll help you out at a fair price. Just found my go-to mechanics in Paso Robles.</Text><userid>108174648945718476101<//userid>< rating>

<text>I was never notified about when more work needed to be done so after it's all said and done my estimate doubled not ok....and now 4 days later and my check engine light has come back on ! So I call them up and I was told to bring it in and it's gonna cost me $250 to fix it ....? First off how would he know that ? And second this is completely wrong ! It's sad how badly theworld has become no one especially paso auto repair takes no pride in  customer service just out to get a buck!</text><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Check engine light came on as we were passing through town and Lalo was very helpful. He checked our car promptly, addressed the issue and thoroughly inspected our car to make sure no visible leaks that would cause us further trouble down the road. We are so grateful for your help!< /Review>

Wish I could give a higher rating. My 2017 RAV4 was giving me a bad sensor reading and said to contact dealer immediately. Paso Robles Auto was close so I brought my car to them. They recommended a diagnostic to determine the cause. The news wasn’t good, but Greg recommended that I contact the dealer as he felt it could be under warranty. I did call and it was covered.   I am traveling from Missouri for the holidays. I again highly recommend this place for their integrity and honesty. Thank you again Isaac, Greg and Lalo😀< /Text>

<Review>Last year we moved into Paso Robles and were looking for reliable auto repair shop. We chose Paso Robles Auto Repair based on their excellent reviews and very glad we did. My yesterday's experience proved that their owner and staff are of extremely high character. I took my car for electrical system check and possible battery change. When I went to pickup the car their staff told me that slight damage was caused to the rear bumper while they were moving the car around. They did not have to let me know about the damage because I never would have noticed at that time and later on would have assumed that damage occurred while I was parked somewhere. I highly commend the honesty and character of the shop owner and his staff. Their action made me their customer for life.<//Review><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Really professional and friendly service. I was out in SLO for work and was having, what I thought was, a battery issue, I pulled in. They checked my battery performance throughly at the bay and also checked the tire pressure and assured me that everything was okay. Didn't charge me for anything and yes, the battery was indeed fine.</text>

A few weeks ago I was driving from the Bay Area down to Los Angeles. It was during that statewide heatwave we were having, and about halfway through my trip I realized it was 115° outside and my air conditioning was not working properly. It was the middle of the afternoon when I pulled off the 101 at Paso Robles and Googled auto repair places nearby. Paso Robles Auto Repair came highly recommended, so I called to plead my case. Isaac told me to come by and they would squeeze me in. Once there, I did not have to wait for them to start work. During my wait, Lalo made sure I was comfortable -- he kept me cool and watered -- while the repairs were being made. My air-conditioning was fixed in short order, and I was back on the road before dinner time. Paso Robles Auto Repair and everybody there was a real lifesaver for me that day!  I would highly recommend Lalo and the shop to anyone!<//Review>

I needed to get my car smogged and had time restrictions I had called other places and no luck but when I called PR Auto Repair he was able to get me in that day. So while there watching them do their thing to my truck I was very nervous because I had failed once before. When I showed him my past test he said I should be able to pass no problem. I only failed before for lack of data. so after what seemed like forever (maybe 15 minutes tops), I pass and I wanted to kiss everyone but I didn't try. The guys there are all friendly and down to earth I was treated with respect and didn't feel like I was taken advantage because I am a woman. Yes I will recommend and yes I will go back when I have the need.
I give these guys 5 stars because that is all they allow but in my book they are a 10 star place.</review>

The boats here are extremely comfortable, the staff incredibly helpful and kind. It's very pleasant to cruise around the lake, especially during the sunset and evening hours.  Perfect for families,  friends, couples ... everyone.</review>

Can you imagine Lake Mission Viejo has a yacht club. Well they do.  Sailing and regattas and festivities. What a wonderful addition to the already spectacular lake.</review>

I found this place after a long search. The complex  was nice and  well-maintained. The management here is the BEST though. They are super responsive if there are any issues. A special mention to Lina and Laquaya, who made sure our move-in and especially our move-out went very smooth. They went out of their way to ensure there is no trouble and am very thankful for that.
It might be a good idea to check out the neighbourhood to ensure you are comfortable, I personally haven't had any issues. Overrall, I enjoyed my stay here.<//text>

Lina, the agent who has been helping me has been gracious and accommodating to me. She's been able to adequately answer all my questions and explain everything that wasn't clear to me. I am very much satisfied with my stay here at AVA 9th so far. I feel very secure staying here and the location is just so convenient.< /review>

I have been residing at AVA 55 for the last 2 months and have loved every bit of the experience since.
They made my move into the community smoother and easier than I have ever experienced before.
A very hospitable team. They make my son and  I feel at home and extremely safe. Right from the maintainence team, to the leasing agents, to the security .. they all make it very special.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>We just moved here. So far the apartment is way better than I expected. We had a self guided tour a few months ago, but decided to not get the apartment. This time we got the apartment because the leasing agent helped us thru the application process and there is a deal going on. The downside of the apt is there is no A/C or fans. But once you open the tiny window, the air flow is quite good, at least so far. Also when you open the shower door, the water on the floor just flows to the carpet. We love that the apartment encourages renters to make their home comfortable by applying all sorts of DIY decorations. There is even a chalkboard wall, and walls full of hangers and shelves. The space is so neatly divided, very smart.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

The building is in a pretty central location, the amenities are great, the views are gorgeous, and the building managers + maintenance are the sweetest.

Building - The building is right across the Market & Walgreens so it's accessible shopping, and only 10 minutes walk from Costco. The downside is there are a few homeless people living near the street and sometimes a few unfriendly people at the end of the block.

Amenities - The patio is great, there's a cool fireplace and pingpong. The gym is really nice and pretty big, you can also bring some stuff to workout outside as well. The puppy/dog amenities are the best, there's this "dog park" that allows your pet to run around and relive themselves. There's also a puppy cleaning station. *only request is to have more official puppy playtime so that we can meet other puppies, neighbors, and run the puppy energy out (haha)

Additional Amenities - Amazon Hub (super convenient), Parking (pretty pricey, $30/night or $400/month), Mail Area

Building Manager + Maintenance - They're super quick to respond. Whenever I post a request, they're up within the day or the next day to assist with the issue. The best part is having Jovan & Brian greet you by the door, they're super friendly and helpful.

The room - The view is amazing and there are enough windows to see basically a 270 view of the city. Though it gets a little warm, you can just install an AC port and it gets cool quickly since the space is a little smaller. The kitchen is great as well. The colors are quite modern and interior is great.</Review>

<Review>AVA 55 Ninth is great! I love the floorplan, quality of the apartment/amenities, and aesthetic. What really makes 55 Ninth so great though is the staff, especially LJ.

My experience with AVA, from viewing to signing to moving in, has been one of the smoothest housing experiences I've ever had. And we all know finding housing in SF ain't easy, especially during a pandemic. The staff, especially Lina and LJ, have been extremely helpful and prompt with every single question I've had. The apartment itself is beautiful, modern, and spacious with a fantastic view of the city and the bay. If you want to live and urban lifestyle with none of the hassle, this is the place for you!<//review>

I've been living at AVA for about a month now. When my roommate and I came to see the place, we knew immediately that we wanted to sign a lease there!

Amazing views from our unit, and the closet space is HUGE. In terms of accessibility, The Market and Walgreens are a short walk from the building for grocery and more. Great amenities - gym, outdoor lounge with heating lamps, a dog park, etc. Neighborhood can be a little dicey because it is along Market. Some strange characters walking around, but quiet for the most part. In terms of safety, there is security present in the building 24/7.

Staff at AVA are amazing! Shout out to Lina who has been helping us since day one of seeing the place. She is always quick to reply with any concerns that we have, and definitely made our move such a breeze!</text>

<review>I did not end up signing but viewed the property. The staff was all really great and very responsive and would follow-up proactively and the prices are reasonable compared to other properties. It felt very techie from the building/residents and even the apartments have unique features like a "gear wall". Nothing wrong with that at all, but I work in tech so personally I wanted home to have a different feel.<//review></record>

< Review>
The good:
-Most of the folks who work for the building are very friendly and helpful. Lina and Otu have been especially helpful (for instance, offering to bring an important package up to my apartment while I was away for a bit, offering advice on different parts of setting up my apartment), but I've had a number of nice interactions with various folks who work here.
-The building is a close enough walk to stuff in Hayes Valley (good food and shops) and also to downtown, if that's important to you.
-The pricing is very competitive for buildings of this quality in San Francisco, or at least was when I signed (I think pricing has gone up a decent amount recently, though I suspect is still ~competitive?)
-24/7 maintenance support has been a blessing when needed.
-Package delivery seems to run fairly smoothly compared to other buildings like this I've lived in.

The less good:
-The area is definitely not phenomenal, and residents should know to expect that before moving in; I'd recommend scouting out the block around AVA in the evening a time or two and making sure that you'd feel comfortable. I mostly handle this by not walking south of the building, and generally not walking east all too often, but I still would like to feel a bit more settled on my block itself.
-COVID-consciousness has been mixed, and though the building staff themselves seem to care about this, I think their hands are tied a bit by being part of a large national chain like Avalon (e.g., unclear whether they can really set and enforce a local policy). For instance, the security contractors who work in the lobby relativley often are not wearing their masks properly, which is disappointing and I'm surprised still an issue after so many months. AVA staff have generally been apologetic about this when I flag it to them - same with the occasional resident trying to not wear masks in the elevators - but at some point there needs to be more action on this front.

Other things to know:
-The apartment layouts can be a bit particular; I like mine, which has a large walk-in closet area, but also the shower is attached to this closet corridor, which might not be for everyone. A bunch of the apartments seem to have sliding doors rather than normal doors as well, which I'd recommend against for further construction, though obviously isn't as much an issue in Studio or 1B apartments.
-If you need help imminently, I'd definitely recommend calling over email; I get the sense there's a lot of inbound email traffic, and so calling tends to be much more reliable and quicker.</Review>

Really good amenities and service, decent value/price ratio. Location is convenient. Unfortunately for a hot year like 2020, the heat waves are almost unbearable because the apartments do not come with ACs. And when you open up the windows for ventilation, be ready for loud noise from SF street lasting all day.<//review>

<text>About us - We saw a few apartments in November and Moved into Ava 55 earlier this month in January 2021

Review -
Showing: The front desk and security personnel are friendly and respectful. They managed the showing really well (contactless because of Covid-19). We saw a couple of different layouts but found one that suited our needs. The 2 bedroom apartments are spacious and all the ones we saw had great views.

Moving in was also managed well by the community managers. Very painless, they reserved a loading bay and elevator for 2 hours.

The people managing the community like Lina and LJ are very good at their job. The security guards are extremely friendly and the staff vibe is always cheerful. The people make the place a good place compared to other communities.

Some cons- The amenities like the gym are currently closed because of Covid.</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

The staff is amazing (big shoutout to Amber)! Lived in AVA 55 temporarily for a few months and loved the building / amenities, so my roommate and I decided to sign a lease. From the get go, Amber went above and beyond in answering our questions and addressing our concerns. She was so helpful and made sure we were 100% satisfied prior to signing the lease. Highly recommend!!< /review>

Taking a virtual tour was easy, and the leasing process was smooth. Move-in was also straightforward and we were even given a cart to help get our things into the apartment! Thanks to LJ for answering a million of my questions and always being very helpful, our experience has been great so far!< /review>

I had been living in AVA for 3 years. I am satisfied amenity / public area / room. Location is not good but good balance between price and location. BUT I am totally dissatisfied about staff. For example, they sent us a wrong contract , charge us a money even I don't give them my signature. Previous staff was great but Laquaya J. Johnson is really bad. Really poor and aggressive communication. That's a shame even this is a good apartment.<//Review>

<Text>I'm very satisfied with living here, AVA 55 Ninth, because of its location, facilities, and cozy & friendly services of community supervisors. Especially for the services of the apartment, I initially had no connection here when I first came to SF. However, I've been able to get what I want from the leasing office and concierge with safety and convenience. I really appreciate all of them and highly recommend to others to be one of the community members!!<//Text><Rate>5</Rate><date>1576540110592</date>< Pics>

<review>Living at AVA has been nothing short of amazing. All members of the AVA staff are competent and helpful-- they always outperform what is expected of them and that behavior makes itself apparent in every facet of the AVA environment. One member of the concierge team in particular, Mason, regularly stays after his shift in order to address any issues I may have and establish meaningful rapport; he isn't just an employee, he strives to embody the philosophy that makes living at AVA feel like a home.

AVA's amenities like the gym and lounge are unlike anything I've ever had available to me in a living complex and, for a dog owner like myself, the dedicated dog-area is a dream come true!

If you're considering a new place to live, I can't recommend AVA 55 ninth enough!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1580766641867, 'text': "Wow, Phillip!

I've lived at AVA since December of 2017 and just resigned a 2 year lease. The location is unbeatable, the amenities are over and above what similar buildings offer, and the staff is friendly, helpful, and quick to respond (especially Otu and Amber). I love hosting brunches for groups of up to 20 on the second floor terrace or gathering in the "chill lounge" to hang out.<//review>

Needless to say, the building is an amazing place to stay. A place I’ve been calling home for almost 2 years, and proudly so. It’s super convenient, stylish, and comes with lots of free stuff haha.

Leasing office manager Amber just hailed over from Boston recently but already made an impression on us as residents. She’s helpful, smart and really puts herself in the residents’ shoes (she is one herself!). All the other staffs are amazingly friendly as well. We love you all!< /Review>

Great place to live!  I moved into AVA 55 Ninth in June 2019 and am loving it.  Beautiful apartment with city view, all appliances, very large gym with all the machines expected and beyond.  Amenities such as fully appointed gathering room, bike storage, dog bathing room and run, outdoor patios with grills, and free wifi in the community areas.  Best thing about the place is the staff--friendly, attentive, and "on it!"  This includes the maintenance staff, who are all on site.  The location is convenient to so many things downtown.  I love this place!<//review>

<review>AVA is located very conveniently, and the staff are all really friendly. Amber has done an incredible job since she's come in as supervisor, and the staff feel almost like family--a nice perk during a strange time in the world. Thanks Amber, Otu, Jermaine, Andres, Diane, Lina, and the rest of the crew.

I'm really impressed by the way AVA management cared for resident health and managed shared spaces during the pandemic. I respect how management is making decisions to help keep us all safe. Thank you!

We love the floor to ceiling windows and the views. We wish the noise from the street weren't so loud when windows are open (in street-facing apartments), but when windows are closed, the soundproofing in the building is spot-on. It's rare to hear our neighbors when inside our apartment.

Would rate at five stars if there were more/cheaper parking.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
For the past year and half, I’ve overlooked the fact that the street is filled with homeless hoping that things would improve. It has not. The street is constantly nasty, and that is literally what I had to face every morning on the way to work. Time to time you see the homeless had followed someone into the lobby, because they are sitting in the waiting area until  the security guard shows up to kick them out. The dial pad in the entrance doesn’t work 90% of the time, so you can’t buzz your visitors in. The managers and staff recently had changed, and they do not respond to your email in timely manner when you request something. I’ve heard that some units have their entire ceiling to floor windows completely shattered due to how the building is built, causing so much pressure to the windows that the entire windows are shattered to pieces. It takes 3 months to get the window replaced, let alone a month for them to do something about it. For the amount of what they are charging for monthly rent, it is totally not worth living here. The walls of the hallway and the amenities are so old and worn out.</Review>

< Review>
First of all, DO NOT TRUST THESE REVIEWS. The apartment hosts events where they pressure you to leave reviews before getting food and drinks.

Ava has absolutely gone down the drain with the new management team and contracted security guards. The new team represents the apartment perfectly -- hip and trendy at first impression, but completely inept after you settle in.

The new security doesn't do anything other than sit inside the leasing office or the courtyard and play with their phones. Homeless drug addicts urinate and defecate literally at the front entrance multiple times a month.

Packages "never arrive" even though the tracking number says they have, and security footage can apparently only be viewed at the head Avalon office, even though there's a computer in the office clearly dedicated to them. For the ones that do arrive, you can't even pick them up because no one works the mail room.

None of the other dog owners pick up after their dogs in the dog run area. It's a minefield out there and management doesn't do anything about it other than send threatening emails to the entire apartment. There are also times were dogs will urinate in the elevator and won't get cleaned up for a days.

I can't wait for my lease to be up. It is NOT WORTH THE PRICE especially in a neighborhood like this. Just walk around a few blocks before you sign the lease and you'll see what I mean.</Review>

Ava is great! Extremely well maintained and the team that handles operations is extremely helpful and friendly. The building is very nice and the rents aren't terribly priced, as far as SF is concerned at least. Nate and his team ease the sticker shock by making the place really feel like home. Building is also great for those that have pets, as there is a closed off patch that allows you to walk your dog at anytime without having to worry about security.< /text>

<Text>I’ve been at AVA for 5 years, ever since I moved to SF, and absolutely love it! I describe the building like a “college part 2” because of the community and friends I’ve made with the neighbors here. It’s great for pet owners as it has a doggie park and doggie shower station. One of the things I also love are the people who work there like Jermain and Jovan! They’re the best— super helpful and always welcoming you with a warm greeting whenever you enter.<//Text><time>1568820983636<//time><userid>105465494124454266158< /userid></record>

<Text>Ava is great! Extremely well maintained and the team that handles operations is extremely helpful and friendly. The building is very nice and the rents aren't terribly priced, as far as SF is concerned at least. Nate and his team ease the sticker shock by making the place really feel like home. Building is also great for those that have pets, as there is a closed off patch that allows you to walk your dog at anytime without having to worry about security.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>FLOOD WARNING! When it rains water trickles into the apartments, enough to damage your belongings! Kyle is the bottom of the barrel in the talent department and has not addressed the issue, nor offered residents any rent concession.

Several apartments are also infested with cockroaches, and have been for years.

Come live here if you are willing to suffer regularly due to his ineptness.</Review>< Pictures>

Quality spot to live in the city!

I'm super grateful to have such an active and nice leasing office as a complement to the great building.

Gym.

Large outdoor patio on the second floor.

The area might be a by "dodgy" but other than that, I'm a fan.<//text>

I'm really conflicted about this review because I really appreciate Brian (the sales & service supervisor) and Otu (not sure his title, but he's a leasing office associate).  But I've recently become annoyed with things here.

Kyle, the former general manager, was a total jerk and would send  emails to the community like, for example, blaming residents for elevator outages claiming residents "holding elevator doors open" was the cause of the consistent elevator issues. Hes since left so good riddance. Meantime elevators have gone down 8-10 times over the last 7 months.<//Text>

In the past 2 of 3 service calls, maintenance left my unit's door unlocked. This is unsettling, especially for a block like this, where you'll come across needles, the mentally unstable, and sidewalk drug use. As I write this, I hear screaming outside. You'll want to get yourself a security camera or two for your unit; I recently did for mine.

On a third and separate occasion prior to the two above, maintenance entered my apartment without notice despite my instructions in the service call request to contact me prior to entry.

On the positive side: once inside the building, it's clean. The staff is friendly.

The gym is nice, though if you want free weights over 50 lbs or are into lifting, you'll need a separate gym membership.

A light sleeper, I have had some problems with noise, and would advise against this building altogether if you're a light sleeper unless you get yourself a top floor unit (though I've heard from residents above that there are water problems). Also, it gets too hot for comfortable sleep by my standards - and opening the windows is definitely NOT an option at night, given the street noise.</text>< Pictures>

<Gmap_id>0x5490148aca2c3e9d:0xf5573bee4e65e43c</Gmap_id><review>Warm and friendly AVA...

I am writing this review after staying with AVA for 1 fantastic year, and moving out shortly for reasons nothing to do with the apartment, the team that manages it or the neighbors. I would recommend this place to all my friends

Move in experience:
We - my wife, my dog and I relocated from another country. Finding an apartment, which is convenient and be able to move in as soon as possible was our top priority. The management at AVA was extremely friendly and guided us step by step (I would specially like to call out Robert and Christina), right from getting our renter's insurance, PG&E - to the move-in formalities. Believe it or not, we were settled in within 7 days of our arrival into the country.

Pet friendliness:
I have a 3 year old English Bulldog. AVA is super pet friendly with facilities like dog run and pet wash. Most residents are also extremely pet friendly, and have pets themselves. This not only helps the overall mindset in the community, but also helps socializing the pets in the evening. Robert, Sal and Christina - I hate to say, but have in a way spoilt my dog. She refuses to go to the apartment without stopping by each of their seats for a treat and pat.

Living experience:
While some of the neighbors may have been no so friendly, repeated complaints and a official compliant to the animal control about my aggressive dog not kept of leash (and my dog seldom barks, seldom runs and is never off leash - except 1 instance when she was returning from a surgery and was loopy) - all my memories of AVA are extremely fond. So much so, that we have many friends in the apartment with whom we can hangout in the evenings and weekends. The team at AVA is also so friendly, they have become close friends.

Overall, if it were not for the neighborhood - AVA scores a 10/10 on my list. Yes, a few may debate the rent increase - but everyone understands that the rent increase is economic factor and as long as there is demand, the supply will keep up.< /review></record>

<Text>DO NOT RENT FROM THESE SLUMLORDS.

Beware that AVA has an ongoing cockroach infestation. The roaches have established a niche in the building. They reproduce quickly and are very hard to eliminate, especially since Ava denies having a building-wide infestation. They occasionally bring in dodgy exterminators, but as long as dumpster-divers and Section 8 folks have free reign of the place, roaches will continue to invade your apartment. They crawl under the door and through the vents.

Bad reviews about infestations get taken down by Yelp, because AvalonBay has a special deal with them. In addition to silencing Yelpers Ava sends out coercive emails to its tenants about online reviews. A while ago they informed us that negative feedback will not be addressed. Also note that nearly all of the positive reviews here come from brand new accounts, so they are most likely fake and written by Ava staff.

Trust me: You’re better off on the street than living in this roach nest.<//Text>< name>

Just moved in here and so far it's been fantastic. The apartment layouts are the nicest I've seen and the views of the city and the bay are incredible. But perhaps the best part about AVA 55 is the staff. Uche showed my roommate and me around and he was extremely friendly and accommodating of our schedule. He really convinced us that AVA 55 should be our future home, and so far I'm very happy with my decision to make the move. Thanks Uche!<//review>

< Review>
AVA 55 Ninth is problematic.

And its tenants are violent. My aggro American neighbour has been bullying me and other minority women in the building for months with his tweaker behaviour, triggering great emotional distress. Things have gotten so bad that I have to leave. Avalon’s bros haven’t lifted a finger to stop the daily microaggresssions next door. Why am I the one who has to move out and not him? Because I don’t have American male privilege. As an immigrant woman I don’t feel that Ava is a safe space. We all know how women and immigrants are treated in Today’s America.< /Review>

Looking for an apartment in the city can be difficult and stressful but as soon as I walked through the doors here I knew this was the perfect place! The facilities are always well kept, it has great security and the staff is super friendly and accommodative. Uche, my leasing consultant,  made the move-in so smooth and always helps in any way he can. Best apartment experience!<//text>

<review>I am coming to the end of my 1 year lease and would stay, because let's be honest, moving is a pain in the ass, but they are asking for a $300-400 increase in my monthly rent, which this neighborhood is not worth imo. I also do not like the protocol in place as it relates to packages. I go to work long before they open and often times arrive home after they close. The concierge is never around and when I am able to retrieve my packages, no one verifies that I am the intended recipient. All you have to do is tell them your apt number and they give you the package. Not once has anyone asked my name, which if they did, they would realize they have been calling me the wrong name for 6 months. I have had 4 other people retrieve packages for me without question.</review>< response>

Public health warning: Do not move into this hazardous place if you care about your health.

AVA has severe and ubiquitous pest infestations, and apartments need to be constantly sprayed with harmful chemicals to keep the pests at bay. Imagine inhaling fumes for months on end. Windows only open a crack, preventing proper ventilation. It’s like living in A GAS CHAMBER!<//review>

<text>AVA 55 Ninth is a great place to live if you can afford it. The location cannot really be beat; it's at the hub of the city. It's 10 minutes downtown by bus, 5 by BART or Muni subway. It's 20 minutes up to the Castro, or 8 by Muni.

The facilities are clean and the staff - both maintenance and management - are very responsive and work hard to fulfill respectful requests and work orders. I had a handful of orders when I lived there, and each one was handled with speed and open communication. The most annoying one turned out to be a faulty smoke detector. When its batteries were replaced and still beeped, I requested a complete replacement of the unit and I was not met with any push-back. Problem solved with some team-work. (Thanks, Harry!)

As for the management, Brian, Kyle, Taemon (and Uche before them) were the closest friends I made in the building. Not that they don't work to create a home-y community in the building for everyone, but that's how we rolled. Every time I had any type of issue with missing moving carts, messes left by other tenants, roommate stuff, these men were kind, understanding, and went out of their way to do whatever I needed to help me out. I am grateful for all their kindnesses and hard work to keep such a large building running as smoothly as possible. Especially with such achingly slow elevators! (NOT that they can do much about them -- those were the choice of the developers!)</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>We cannot speak more highly of AVA 55! Both the building and the staff are the best. The amenities are countless: the dog run and wash station make it incredibly easy for our small dog; the 2nd-floor courtyard and gym are spacious and clean; WiFi runs throughout the building; Paramo coffee in the lobby is wonderful! Also, the location is very convenient (the BART is on the same block; Hayes Valley is a 10 minute walk and Financial District is a 25 minute walk).

Having just moved across the country, Nathaniel and Kimmie have made everything so easy. They have been incredibly amenable and flexible despite many logistical headaches! The security staff have also gone above and beyond to help with deliveries after hours. Every member of the staff is friendly, prompt, and professional. In short, they are incredible.

We look forward to enjoying the many perks of living at AVA 55!<//Review>< rating>

I strongly advise that you be skeptical of many of the online reviews of Ava55. The  building sends out ethically questionable communications to residents strongly encouraging them not to post anything negative. See below for an email I recently received from the landlord and ask yourself if you want to live in a building that does not respond to negative feedback.

AVA 55 Residents

We here at AVA 55, being our Leasing Team, Mgmt and Maintenance Team, cannot express enough how much appreciation we have for our residents. Its because of you that we strive to provide the best service possible and come to work everyday happy to see our smiling residents! We provide a home for each one of you, which we take very seriously and is a difficult challenge, and we chose this profession and we personally enjoy the obstacles of creating an enjoyable and comfortable lifestyle for all different standards and expectations.

Did you know the best way for AVA 55 (AvalonBay/Corporate) to see the satisfaction results is with Yelp and Google reviews!!! ....and THE MORE POSITIVE FEEDBACK WE HAVE, THE GREATER AVA MGMT CAN KEEP STRIVING FOR BETTER RESULTS AND ACTUALLY DO THINGS THAT OUR RESIDENTS ASK FOR.

What happens is, corporate reviews this feedback, when something works in a positive way then we at the local level get to ask for more in order to keep providing additional amenities, services, more concierge hours, package assistance, etc. Ever wanted that row machine in gym? Ever wanted a weekly happy hour with free food and drinks? Ever wanted to negotiate your renewal rate? Whatever it is, the more we see our residents are happy, the more we (leasing team) can have leverage to give more back to YOU, our resident.
Also;
- in our improvements like after hours concierge services
- more communication with our building improvements/out of order status, etc
- social events
- local outreach within the community
- response times with general questions from our leasing office and maintenance team

If you don't know your Leasing Team including Brian, Taemon and Kyle, we ask that you come by and say hello sometime. Our Maintenance Team, you know, the ones that actually go into your home to fix things...they are off the hook too! We want to know what you want/need to make your living experience better here (realistic please...we are not adding a pool and hot tub on the roof top..) All residents want different things and we appreciate all hobbies, interests, and perhaps we can change some things that you don't think we can. The trick is in order for us to go back to Corporate and push for more they have to see what we are doing (or trying to do) is actually working so if possible, AND only if you truly feel good about AVA 55 and want more, please provide some positive feedback on Yelp and Google. Also, negative feedback typically does not "fix" anything and the concerns are usually not answered.

Thanks from your Leasing & Maintenance Team at AVA 55!

It’s overrun by Section 8 tenants who take over the public spaces with all their offspring. They’ve set up a whole shantytown down by the barbecues. They change diapers on the patio and just leave them there.

<Text>We had a fantastic experience working with Uche at Ava 55 9th street. I couldn’t believe how responsive and extremely helpful he was to all of our requests and questions, and he knew far more than we ever hoped to about the process of renting a new apartment.

Uche was patient, highly knowledgeable about building and the Bay Area, which was extremely helpful as we are doing all this while living in New York.

– I cannot recommend Uche highly enough!

<rate>5</rate><review>Uche at the leasing office is more compassionate, accommodating, and accessible than that pumpkin spice late at the starbucks around the corner from your house. He, and the straight-up ballers who jam outside the leasing office, make this place feel like home. They are the friendly neighbors that sit across the street on their porch and shout an inside joke at you as you walk up your steps.

They are more responsive than apple's UX design department, and more stylish than your gay uncle and his "friend" at thanksgiving dinner.

But in seriousness, the leasing office makes this place feel like home. I am going on my third year at AVA, and each time I replaced a roommate, updated a lease, or renewed, Uche and the team were there for me.<//review>< pictures>

Stay away if you’re a woman. We have some bad hombres here. Don’t take the staircase, and if you see a masked man – run outside and find a safe space.

Avoid becoming a #MeToo victim!< /Text>

We moved here from a different state with limited time to find a place, and we really enjoyed the place. We have two dogs, one being a boxer, and many places don't accept Boxers but Avalon is really great with their pet policies. The concrete floors are amazing when you have pets. So easy to clean. We also have a three year old who loved the patio area and the game room they have for him. The dog run is so convenient when you are in a rush. Maintenance is awesome and so friendly. The staff are very responsive. We've enjoyed living here and really appreciate the customer service the community provides. The elevators also are pretty fast. We lived on the 16th floor and it was pretty speedy. We can't hear any of our neighbors ever either probably becuse the floors are concrete. The neighborhood is not in the best part of town, but I never felt unsafe with my son and dogs, and I'm a tiny Asian woman. I loved being close to the Bart and the Muni stop, and a few blocks from the Westfiled mall, etc. I could also hop on the bus with my son to take him to school in Outer Richmond, which only took us about a thirty minute bus ride. Great commuting location. Also, Trader Joes is down the street so I was able to walk with my son to grab grocieries. Great place to live!<//text>

<gmap_id>0x5490148aca2c3e9d:0xf5573bee4e65e43c</gmap_id><Text>COCKROACH ALERT! Do not move into this cockroach-infested hellhole!

AVA 55 Ninth has cockroaches in all different sizes, and they are everywhere - in the shower, in the kitchen, in the bedroom. Imagine these pests creeping around your apartment when you’re cooking or watching TV at night.

Ava is full of garbage-picking tenants who cause infestations, and the management office has no interest in solving the problem.

Once you have signed a contract and the cockroaches come crawling, don’t expect Avalon to let you out of your lease or compensate you in any way. You will be stuck with these unwanted roommates!

I do not wish this dump upon my worst enemy.< /Text></record>

You get fast friendly service at a reasonable price. Their donuts melt in your mouth. The breakfast croissants are perfect and their shakes are to die for!!!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I ordered a coconut smoothie that came out tasting like rotten milk. I handed back the full smoothie and asked for my refund, and the lady tells me "the coconut just comes tasting like that". I explained that I can't drink it, it's incredibly foul, and she immediately loses it. She yells "FINE!" and starts slamming the cash register, shoves the money in my hand, and throws the smoothie across the kitchen. I kid you not, I can't make this up. She threw it. All over $3.50.</text>

<Review>Great quiet park with lots of boulders for kids (and adults) to climb. No play structures or anything like that, but lots of open spaces for playing. If you are affiliated with a bonafied youth group, you can reserve one of the group camping spaces, otherwise it's day use only.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>This place is great! There is a ton of things to do here. We were here for 5 hours and didn't even really scratch the surface of the park. A cheap way to stay entertained for the whole day. Next time we're gonna bring lunch for a picnic. My wife says to wear your sneakers!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Nice park with the usual amenities like toilets and picnic tables. The main interest for me, though, is that it is the trailhead for Rattlesnake Canyon Trail.<//text>

Bought a bunch of parts to partially restore our 1968 Beetle Coupe, and have had nothing but exceptional service. I live in Canada, and even with cross border shipping everything has gone flawlessly. Even when wrong parts were shipped to me, I had a personal email sent to me BEFORE I noticed they were wrong. They literally emailed me saying “hey, you might have gotten wrong parts, let me know so I can fix the issue ASAP”. People make mistakes, and I appreciated the fact that they wanted to rectify the issue immediately before I had to complain. Everything that showed up has fit perfectly, and showed up with better quality than I expected. For the cost of everything on the website, the quality is 10 times higher than I expected. Easy install, instructions, fast shipping and perfect service. Personal shout out to Mark as well - he is the one that emailed me immediately after the shipment went out with the wrong carpet kit. Even replies to emails after hours from his cell at home.

Happy customer over here. You guys should charge more for your products! Definitely under cutting yourselves. Thanks for the help with our beetle.<//text>< resp>

We arrived from the east coast, excited to visit Wolfsburg West. How lucky were we to have a private tour with the owner! The staff was so awesome and the facilities were amazing. This was a perfect way to start off our SoCal trip.<//Review>

Thank God for this guy! This is Mike at WW who had been so incredibly helpful and kind to us over the last 3 years duiring our build. She's all finished and today was her maiden voyage, to WW nonetheless. Took her to meet Mike.</Review>

If you need replacement parts for your vintage Volkswagen than this is your dream supplier. Everything from steering wheels to original material seat pads... You can order online by phone or drop by here to pick up. I was impressed on their prices too.<//review>

These guys are awesome. I ordered a part on Monday and received it Wednesday, all the way from California to Georgia. Not only was shipping fast, the part was excellent quality. These guys are extremely knowledgable and friendly 10/10 recommend them.< /text>

Some guys don't know VW'S
Ask for someone that knows their stuff not just catalog numbers
Some guys just look at catalog.
Check your order before leaving at least twice
SPECIFY EACH PART FOR THE YEAR CAR YOU ARE ORDERING FOR.
They do have great parts variety and good quality of parts they have made</Review>

I have a 1966 VW and someone had installed a cheap plastic body fuel level float before I got the car. When I filled it up it leaked around the hinge point. I took a chance and ordered from these folks and for a good price received and metal body fuel float with the proper weighted end.

Thank you!<//review>

Volkswagen bug parts warehouse which does not price match the local area (35 mile radius) competition. It had done so previously and HAD the best customer service. I will shop elsewhere and it will be worth it.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Good service, very good quality of spare parts, unfortunately only partially cover the early VWs. Have many parts reproduced.

(Original)
Guter Service, sehr gute Qualität der Ersatzteile, decken leider nur teilweise die frühen VWs ab. Lassen sehr viele Teile nachfertigen.<//Review>

< Review>
I was taken by surprise by how little but well stocked this market is. Its small but has a good variety. I recommend if you need basic groceries from queso fresco to chiles verdes to gelatin and more. The guys working here are super nice aswell.</Review>

<rating>4<//rating><text>This is a nice & clean little store 😊 I like that everything that I needed was conveniently located right under this roof. Everything from coconut water to power steering fluid and sour cream. They also have fresh produce as well and lots of candy authentic Mexican candy at that! I was very pleased. The gentleman at the counter was very friendly and helpful. They also have a taco stand outside that I'm not sure is affiliated with them however the aroma was Heavenly when I pulled up. If I wasn't going home to cook I would have definitely stopped to grab a taco. This place is pretty cool 😎👍👍👍👍<//text>< Pics>

Great new poke shop with a nice selection of ingredients to build a bowl with. Staff was friendly and patient with us as we worked through their new (to us) menu. I did appreciate the the appreciate the variety of toppings that added texture to my bowl. Albeit a bit on the pricier side, I feel that the portion sizes and amount of protein (both in number and size) and variety made it worth it.</text>

<Review>The place is clean, the staff is courteous and extremely patient.  I'm sure the same questions arise day in and day out, but they answer with a friendly tone and a smile.

The selection and quality are great, and with the price of a two-protein bowl equivalent to a fast food combo meal, the health aspect of a poke bowl is preferable.< /Review>< UserId.>

My favorite poke spot in Temecula! I've come here for myself, sometimes with my boyfriend, and I've come to pick up 6+ custom bowls for everyone at work, every time I'm here the staff is super friendly, patient when I have big orders, and the food is amazing! Always tastes fresh, great amount of toppings to choose as well as more base choices than I have seen at other places, from and their sauces are great! Highly recommend coming here when you crave poke< /Review>

Very clean restaurant with very helpful and knowledgeable staff.  They know how to steer you through their many toppings and variations quickly without rushing you.  I ended up with exactly what I didn't know I wanted.

A wide variety of quality fresh seafood complimented by a huge array of unique toppings (from pickled cabbage to soft egg cubes).

I definitely recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner.</Text><rating>5<//rating>< Name>

The atmosphere is quaint and inviting while not feeling dark or cozy. The staff were very very friendly and made it clear they were thankful for your business, they also were able to help build your bowl and help create something delicious. They also gave out samples and let you try what you were choosing. Needless to say the food was brilliant and if I was a local I would eat here regularly.</Text>< user_name>

Great food but wasn't very friendly.  It was obvious staff didn't want to be there or they were annoyed that I brought in my kid and asked for chicken bowl on the menu which apparently was not available because fryer is broken…<//text>

Been trying several of the Poke spots in the Temecula area lately and this one is so far the best. Fresh, tender and delicious fish and all the good fixings I look for and surprisingly the cheapest of the three spots I've visited so far. I will be going back soon!< /Text>

Best damn Poke in Temecula, a city made famous by a sandwich shop mentioned in Bojack Horseman. You must try (the poke). Value is really good and you get a sizable amount.<//text>

Cute place, nice atmosphere, employees were very friendly. Unfortunately My brown rice in my bowl had been sitting in the cooker so long it was clumped and dark brown. I took 2 bites and couldn’t eat anymore. Also portions on fish and other sides was so small compared to every other poke place I have been to. Not sure I will be back<//Text>

<Text>First impression when I walked in; Clean establishment. The staff was extremely polite and professional while suggesting every option they had for me to choose from as well as letting me sample whatever piqued my interest. From the poke to the toppings; everything was extremely fresh. Their sauces are also superb while some can be slightly overpowering there are many to choose from; I got their Lemon Shark sauce on the side and enjoyed it. My biggest qualm about my experience; albeit not a bad thing, was the rice portioning i received. I believe I choose a medium and received two cups of rice. A suggestion could be either to serve less or make it an option to ask for less. Overall my experience was great, this place is now my "go-to" poke bowl eatery in town.< /Text><name>Christian Cardinal<//name>< UserId.>

< Review>
I love lemon shark. They are always so fresh and clean. Very tasty but today i went there with my husband who doesn't  eat fish but loves the catsu chicken. Today they were out of chicken so I didnt get my poke. So bummed. I hope you don't get rid of the chicken. That is the reason for only 1 star. I akways give them 5 because they are so good. Please get more chicken.<//Review>

I ordered online and had it delivered, also got the shrimp tempura but didn't think to take pictures until after I snarfed them though 😱 Love the topping options and the scoops are huge! Even the masago was a big pile. Really excited that tamago is a topping option, it's one of my favorites! Can't wait to bring the boyfriend since the vegetarian options are so awesome! Highly recommend if you love poke! 😋<//Review>< pictures>

Pretty fantastic. It is a little pricier then the other places I have been in the area but the fish was beyond fresh and they have some fantastic add ons and sauces.<//review>

If you enjoy Poke, you absolutely have to try this place! They have some very different bases to choose from, like crispy wontons and forbidden rice. Also, the spicy salmon is much better than other poke places I've been to. They let you sample anything before you decide to add it to your bowl, and everything I tried I ended up adding. The proteins are fresh and they don't skimp.

Unlike most other place I've been, they charge extra for crab meat and avocado, but I think that is more than made up for by all of the other great choices they have. The pickled cabbage might not sound good, but it is delicious. The staff are super friendly and helpful (like I forgot to mention my order was to go, and he easily transferred it to a plastic bowl while still keeping the great presentation) so don't be shy to ask them if you have any questions.

So yeah, I'll be going back here soon. Great Poke place in a sea of new poke places that are just ok. Oh, and to top it off, they are on Mogl! If you know what that is, then you know the price can't be beat. ;)<//text>

They didn't want to see my 2 kids 8 & 9 because it's only 1 child and 1 parent at a time. They wanted me to leave 1 of my kids in the waiting room alone. If this is their new method, they should of advise us parents when the appointment was made, so we can only bring 1 child at a time. My kids were looking forward to their appointment, since it's they're 1st time here. What an experience they had. Just hoping Altamed is not this way all the time. I work and had to request this day off, and now thanks to their lack of communication I'll need to take another day off. Just like they ask for our punctuality, they should provide us with good  communication. Altamed South Gate Dental<//text>

I absolutely dislike this place, I do not recommend at all. If you have the option to go somewhere else DO SO. The front desk girl are so rude they have me waiting there for more than an hour when I had an appointment and there was no one there when I got there.. they didn’t look busy at all and when I ask questions they never care about the patients and don’t care if you walk out.. this appointment was really important to me and I just wasted 1 hr of my life sitting there bc I didn’t even get seen. These worse part is that this isn’t the first time it happens!! Would give it 0 stars if I could..</Text>

There is no direction or any order when it comes to their Covid-19 testing and it seems that a lot of their security/ non medical employees are rude and poorly equipped to handle situations. They let people make their own rules of the road. I was waiting my turn behind two cars before the lines merged and with no direction the other line who had a stop sign as well as the line I was in just kept going not letting cars from the other line get in and that happens because lack of signage lack of direction and lack of common decency from not only the facility but the patients who go there. I expect more from a company that is so large and charges a medium to high amount< /Text>

<Review>Altamed is not a good clinic anymore. Went for a physical exam to check my health and they didn’t even do a blood test or urine test. I would have rated this a one star but since the doctor was really nice i gave it an extra star. Please find better healthcare< /Review>< pictures>

The front desk is very disorganized and don't know what they are doing. They left my grama in the waiting area and just left home. What kind of clinic is this. She had to ask the security if there was anything there to see her because she had beed waiting for 2hrs+ and all the front desk was gone!< /text>

Worst urgent care for dental!!! My child was in so much pain crying and screaming.The nurse's and the people in the front would only watch so useless. I left without getting help. A few friends had told me dont take your child there. Who ever is in charge there needs to get fired. Please owner send a undercover mom with a child there for urgent care. Also they take a huge break is supposed to be an hr. Not an 1hr with 45 mins.. DON'T GO THERE PEOPLE< /text>

Bad reception service, they treated my mother very badly, the resepcionista had a sour character and also the same resepcionista dared to scold my mother, what a horrible place for patient care, still the attention with the doctor was horrible,  The woman at no time let my mother explain where it hurt, moreover the doctor did not let even speak to my mother, it was horrible medical attention.  I do not recommend this place, look for another place that is better, this place is not worth it.</Text>

I took my mom this week to AltaMed and we were provided the most excellent service. She doesn’t have insurance at the moment and that itself is stressful. The visit was low cost and even included x-ray and bloodwork. Everyone was nice and so helpful. Everything about it amazing 💕💕 So thank you for all the work you do and your company is amazing 🙏🏼<//Review>

<text>That’s true, urgent care admits patients after 1. But as far as a regular clinic, I love the the staff. I have brought my son for multiple appointments. I always bring him to Dr.Gantan! All the other pediatrician have been amazing as well.</text>< resp>

<Review>Well you can’t come here if you’re not “assigned to them”. SMH. Not even for Urgent Care services. So, please take the sign off your door that states you’ll see any patient that walks in. NOT true. My son has medi-cal and was not able to be seen.</Review>< pictures>

This place is just terrible, they say they have Urgent care but in order to see a doctor you have to wait until after 1PM  so my wife gets there at 12pm and they tell her everything is full 😭
and at the end you end up going to the one in Commerce, " My son had a fever and when I call to see if my son's doctor can see him they said that the only available appointment was in three days " ¡¡¡Unbelievable!!  I ended up leaving
They just don't care about their patients.<//Review>

I love Altamed. I have never recieved better healthcare. I have been with them for about 5 years and I couldn't be happier.

My dentist, Bernadette Leoncio and her team are amazing. Daisy Rivas is one of the kindest receptionists ever staffed. She remembers my name and greets me warmly. Her assistants Diana Aguilar and Rocio Ramirez are knowledgeable and well trained.

During my appointment today to have my cavities filled I was so comfortable that I nearly fell asleep. It sounds crazy but it's TRUE. Thank you to all of Altamed for your service to local communities. Your level of healthcare is beyond measure in my eyes.< /Text>

<response>None<//response><pics>None</pics><Name>Lan Zam</Name><Review>I like that this location is close to where I live but whenever I need to take my kids to urgent care I end up going to Commerce or Pico because Urgent care at this location starts at 1pm and sometimes 2pm because the doctors are in a meeting. They should offer better urgent care hours and they should be open on weekends like Commerce and Pico too. Also, whenever I want to schedule an appointment there's never any available so I have to continually call to see if there's any appointments sooner. I really like this location but if they were to improve those 2 things it would be so much better.
Update: I went back to urgent care at this location again at 4pm because the hours of urgent care start at 1pm and they said that they dont see anyone until 6pm! What kind of urgent care service is that, very disappointed.< /Review>< GmapID>

Furthermore, when is bias towards you, he starts to contradict the causes of symptoms with a psychological prospect and then gets in your business like asking you personal questions about your personal life and relationships. It makes you feel interrogated, how offending because it is not supposed to be his business.

Horrible staff. They schedule months later, then tell you at 11am and hand you a card with the date and time. Then you show up and they tell you it was for 1pm you show them card and they tell you they're sorry theres other patients ahead of you...inconsiderates.</review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Good Lord, this is the absolute WORST medical clinic I've ever been to. First, when you call, you get a switchboard operator not even in the same building, who places all the calls for you while you sit on hold FOREVER, and sometimes get hung up on (twice this happened to me in just two weeks!) After that, once you get into the place, and the nurse says she's going to call in a prescription, she never does. It took me two days to get a prescription filled! THEN (and currently this is still an issue) after the doctor tells you she's going to send off urine for a culture, you wait around for nearly TWO WEEKS and still I don't have the results! I called again yesterday, and was told someone would call me by the end of the day. Well, someone did call me, and she told me the results are in, but because she's not 'qualified' to give patients results, she couldn't even tell me anything - WHY even call if you can't give me the information I obviously need? And I know it doesn't take two weeks for a urine culture to come back, so that means they've been sitting on this for DAYS and no one bothered to call. Anyway, the 'unqualified' lady told me she would have the doctor call today and give me the information - here it is, after the clinic is closed, and STILL NO CALL! Seriously, this place is a joke. Unprofessional. Unorganized. RIDICULOUS. I will never go there again, to ANY AltaMed. EVER.< /review><resp>{'time': 1506098820262, 'text': 'Hi Jessica,\nThank you for your feedback and we are sorry that you had a bad experience at our medical office.

<user_name>Diana Nochebuena</user_name><review>(Translated by Google) horrible service !!! The nurse who attended me was whipping the pressure device, the temperature almost put it in my mouth, I was in a bad mood and treating me with discrimination, I did not say anything out of respect and just twisted my eyes as if I had done something to her and The doctor did not want to check the pharmacy if it was good, they behaved well badly

the truth that they should change their staff !!!
they make you feel bad

(Original)
horrible el servicio !!! la enfermera que me atendio andaba azotando el aparato de la presion el te la teperatura casi me lo encaja en la boca andaba de mal humor y tratando me con discriminacion no le dije nada por respeto y nomas torciendonlos ojos como que si le hubiera hecho algo y el doctor no quiso cheqar la farmacia si estaba bien se portaron bien mal

la verdad que deberian de cambiar su staff !!!

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) 10 days ago I had an accident, they put 6 stitches on me, today I went to this clinic so that a doctor could tell me if the wound is healing well or not.
And they didn't want to attend me because I have an appointment for a week and until then they can see me

(Translated by Google) It is a clinic crap I took my children for emergency because I had taken them to the hospital I had to follow up with their family doctor and the appointment they gave me was for 2 months and I wanted to take them urgently and I was denied care despite how they saw them wrong .. I do not recommend it or 1℅ bad service they are only good to charge

Saturday about 12:30 PM we were seated after a 1 minute wait and had iced tea at the table 2 minutes later.  My wife orders a spicy south of the border bowl with prawns and I had the classic  cheese burger with fries, my burger was better than I expected and to say the least, better than most other restaurant burgers costing twice as much and the fries were spot on.
I  didn't try the bowl thing but the wife said it was right at the border of being to spicy.
The waitress was perfect.<//Text>

It was so nice to dine in for the first time in a few months. Applebee's did not disappoint either. Both the service and the food were on point. Thanks for a great night out!< /Text>

After being seated, we waited over 10 minutes before someone asked if we wanted something to drink. After that, our waitress disappeared and our food was served by various staff members. When my drink was low, nobody offered me a refill. The food came out late and finally the server returned at the end to see if we needed anything.<//review>

< Review>
I honestly wasn't expecting much from an Applebee's but somehow they still disappointed. As a group of three, we waited over an hour around 7pm on a Tuesday night to be seated. The hostess originally said it would be 30 minutes. I totally understand and support COVID restrictions and difficulties but there was ample seating both inside and outside of the restaurant with multiple parties leaving during that time frame. The hostess and staff never acknowledged the wait time to us. We also waited over 10 minutes once seated just to get our drink orders.  My veggie burger was dry and crispy?? and there was no cheese even though I asked for it. The waitresses were pleasant and nice but not the fastest. There was one staff member working take out that was hustling hard. I thought maybe the restaurant was busy or under staffed but I actually heard one waitress say "I'm glad it's slow tonight because I start a new day job tomorrow. I didn't make any money tonight". We also had 3 different waitresses because ours went on break during the meal, which is fine, but we waited and didn't have the best service because of it. I also overheard a manager and waitress talking about this location saying "the management isn't good" and "it used to be a lot different."  I still tipped over 20% because it isn't the service staff's fault and these are tough times but ... literally NOTHING went right during our trip there. I thought I was being Punked.</Review>

<Review>Love the wonton tacos you can almost make a meal out of them.  Always consistent quality and generous portion sizes. I have dined at the in Santa Rosa location by Costco on 3 occasions over a 4 year period and each time our orders were either forgotten or the wrong meal delivered. The Napa location is best never had a problem as with the Santa Rosa location< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Just went to dinner here and it was by far the BEST dinner I’ve ever had that I did not cook myself. I’ve been to Applebee’s before but it was not like that. Whoever is in the kitchen tonight is getting DOWNNNN. Everything was cooked perfectly, so on point. I had the blackened Cajun salmon with garlic green beans and mashed potatoes. The salmon was like butter on the inside but not flaky and nice and crispy on the outside. The spinach artichoke dip was AMAZING and the hottest I’ve ever had it. My husband had the burger and chicken & shrimp from the 2 for $22 menu. The chicken was cooked perfectly to where it was juicy but not pink, the onions were caramelized but still had a little texture to them. I ordered a mango dragonfruit lemonade that came out like candy, so good. And the service was impeccable. I wish I remembered our servers name because she was so nice and so quick. Overall best restaurant experience I’ve ever had. Better than any expensive 5 star place I’ve ever been. Will DEFINITELY come back to this location.<//Review>

The Strawberry Salad with Chicken was delicious. The patio dining was very pleasant, with a nice breeze. However, the service was somewhat slow, even though there weren't many diners at 2:30 pm.<//text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>My mother and I have been coming here since it first opened. My older sister even worked here for a long time. So we've had our Red Apple card for a long time. We were told by my sister and a few others to never get a new one because they changed their discounts. (Old card says 20% off. New card says 10%) technically if the card we have says 20%... they have to honor it. So today we were refused the discount. We were told to get a new card and we refused. Totally wasn't our server's fault, but the manager was too busy to see us. Not sure if I should keep coming back.</review>< Pictures>

Great service most of the time. However, our server forgot to refill our drinks in at least two ocations.
Other than that everything else was really good!
Today the service is great since they have to maintain the social distance between tables. Which helps on getting service much quicker!< /review>

Best place to.come for food and drinks. Two happy hours: 4 pm - 6 pm and 9 pm - midnight. 1/2 price appetizers and amazing deals on drinks. Bartenders are amazing and drinks are good!  If you come here often, they will remember your name and what you like to drink. Just come on over!  You will have an awesome time!!!</Text>

<Text>While it may not be a gourmet restaurant, it certainly doesn't claim to be either. If you want to get dinner for a large group or your family without breaking your bank, then this is the place to go. And if you want cheaper drinks, then their evening happy hour is an excellent opportunity to grab a very appetizers or entrees to share and hang out with some friends. Plus, there is trivia available at every table that you can play and compete against other people in other restaurants. Definitely have spent many fun evenings here with friends.<//Text>< pics>

Everytime I looked up they were all cleaning. It is a strange new world so it was nice to go out with hubby & kids for a "normal" Father's Day dinner. I got the Cheeseburger protein style with a side of broccoli and it was delicious!! Hubby tried the chicken with stuffed ravioli and garlic breadsticks.kids went for fiesta lime chicken and french onion soup. We are all trying to stay safe and cope so it was a pleasant night out with family at Applebees.<//Review>< Pics>

My family and I go to Applebees once every few months. We went most recently on Valentine's day. They were pretty busy and our server was quick and attentive. Our food arrived in the expected amount of time and was hot and tasty. My husband got a full rack of ribs that were delicious, just about fall off the bone tender and just enough sauce without being too much. I would recomend this location to friends and family.< /Text>

How was Applebee's Grill? Frankly, not that great. The staff was friendly and polite but it doesn't really make up for the lackluster food or drinks. It seems like at some point in the last 10 years places like Applebee's became fast food joints with draft beer, which does sound pretty cool. So if you know that walking in then this restaurant is probably 4 stars. But they market themselves as a "Bar & Grille" and based on that Applebee's is 2 stars.<//text>

<Review>Food is uninspiring. Staff were barely friendly and inattentive. Place was freezing cold at 5:30pm customers were going out to their cars for hats and gloves.

No service at all. I waited 30 minutes just to talk someone. The registration counter was deserted the entire time. When I finally got someone's attention and asked for the manager, he literally refused to offer us a table,  although the restaurant was only half filled at that time. In 15 years living in the U.S. this was the weirdest restaurant experience.< /Text>

Corporate comfort-food, nicely done. Despite being a big chain restaurant, this one manages to feel like a genuine neighborhood eatery, with a lot of local regulars. Food is at the exact mid-point between McDonald's and French Laundry. Know what to expect and you won't be disappointed. Great service from a generally upbeat staff. Nice.<//Review>

Pretty tasty meal. The menu has an option for just about anybody including a fair amount of specials like 2 entrees and an appetizer for x amount.  Go during happy hour to save a little dough on your drink a and appetizers as well.  This is conveniently located and usually doesn't take too long to get your meal and be out of there quickly. The service was excellent during my visit.<//Text>

Terrible experience. We weren't greeted by the host. We had to walk up and ask for a table. And then once we finally got a table it took the server 15 minutes to come to our table. We finished our appetizers before I got my drink from the bar. And I had to ask a couple times for water. There was also a free appetizer promo going on and we asked our waitress about it and then she never came back to our table. We asked someone else to speak to a manager and he was nice and gave us appetizer coupons but overall it was not a good experience at all.</text>

We did call and spoke to a manager and he said that he would comp us and email me the coupon for that comp however I still never received it. When I go there again probably yes it is conveniently down the street for me and the food is usually well enough. I just hope the service quality what continue to deplete<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

The one here in Napa was great!!! Twice we've gone to the one in Vallejo. The last time was at least a few years ago. Service was so bad. We never went back.<//text>

<Review>Horrible food that tasted like it was a frozen meal barely heated. Not many vegetarian options. Service was attentive and friendly but sadly the meals were so bad. I’m actually was in pain after eating half of what they call a healthier meal: shrimp with stir fry veg and rice.

Restaurant was extremely cold and customers had to wear their coats inside. Poor management is to blame.</Review>< response>

Hopefully your food doesn't taste like it was microwaved because my food sure did. Especially my fries. I've microwaved fries MANY times in my life and this is exactly what they've been tasting like. Maybe there's new staff or cooks.... May have to take a break from this place for a while...</review>

<Text>The food was nothing special. My family and I agreed we would've had better tasting food going to one of the local fast food restaurants.I ordered a mudslide and my son ordered a milkshake. By the time we got them they were straight liquid & semi warm. The waiter was decent and professional which is the only reason I did not give a lower rating. We will not be going back to this Applebee's.<//Text>< pics>

We only got the mozzarella sticks before our meals we then got one of the meals and a kids meal. After 20 minutes we got another of our meals and the other kids meal after 10 minutes of that we got our last meal needless to say we all didn't eat at the same time and then 10 minutes after we all had our meals our boneless wings were ready. The chicken and ribs were under cooked. I'm not sure if they had new people working the line but this is not acceptable.  Our waitress was good. Theres only so much she could do if she didn't have the food to take to us. We could tell she was getting a lil frustrated with the kitchen people</Review>< pictures>

Our family went this past weekend. Service was very good, our waitress was very patient while taking our orders. The food was a disappointment, I have been at this Applebee’s before and have not been disappointed. This time it did seem like food was placed in a microwave and just heated. I would have given this place a better rating but the food really disappointed. One more thing, it seemed like the people in the back had their own thing going on because you could hear the music playing very loud.<//Review>

Sub-par food today and the waiter didn't ask about it at the appropriate time. Fish was hot and our fries were cold. Bizarre burger and too heavily breaded onion rings. Not good recipes.  The hostess didn't say one word to us, entering or leaving.<//Review>

I was celebrating my birthday with my parents and the waitress that helped us was really rude .we were trying to give her our order and she was always rushing us and being interrupted by other tables that she didn't take there order and they where there first I felt bad for them . And we also had other waitress helping us more than she did . She gave us this attitude of I don't like doing this . Food was good for us the adults . I don't recommend ordering kids pizza  Nether of my kids where interested in eating it . I love pizza so what ever my kids don't it I would not this time do .Thank good for the mash potatoes .<//review>

I ordered a bourbon street steak, and it was half the size of what I used to get.  What happened?

Edit: Owner reply did't say anything...???  Need to use social media effectively.  Adjusting down to 1 star.

To add to my experience, I mentioned this issue to the waitress that night.  She didn't mention this to the kitchen or manager...  Applebee company website doesn't mention changing portion size of this steak.  I ate this same entree for years in Fresno.  The steak that night was half the size.  I'll remember to take photos in the future for reference.  I won't be going back to this location, though.  There are many other restaurants near by.  I made the wrong selection that night.<//text>

I just ordered to go and the lady told me I need to come in to get my food at the bar, but then she can deliver outside to the car next to us? Terrible customer service. The lady also tried to argue with me on the phone when I asked about the menu prices. Unecesary hassle for overpriced food.<//text>

It's going downhill! The food needs work again, the service is slow although with a smile, nothing good to say. I was here about 2 months ago and was the same. So I gave it 1 more chance. Will not return!</review>

Great service, comfy vibe. So many TVs! The price can't be beat, like, literally there is no way to make this food any cheaper than it is.

Napa locals love it, it's the nighttime version of Black Bear Diner.

The wedge salad paired with the Sutter Home Sangria is wine country living!<//Review>

I haven't had anything delicious here.  Most of the food is too salty. It's just okay, it's edible, it's open late, they have mixed drinks.< /Text>

Really good happy hour deals, the customer service here is better than any other Applebee's I have visited. Great place to come and unwind, grab a beer and watch some sports.< /Text>

I asked for decaf tea and got caffinated tea. Ordered double steak and eggs, only got one piece of steak. However, management came over, apologize, and fixed the problem.. when time to pay the bill, I had an additional charge for something that I never ordered.

< review>
Applebees did a great job considering we were a group of 13 and we requested separate checks. The fish and chips was very good but could have been a bit crisper. Applebees isn't set up to handle groups this large. We had 8 at a large booth and 5 at the booth next to us. Food server was friendly and provided great service. I recommend Applebees. There are many wonderful items on the menu.</review>

On Oct. 17th my Husband and I our 35 years anniversary dinner and it was very good. We noticed the couple next to us and it was her Birthday the staff came out and sang and treat. My Husband wanted to take me  back for my Birthday  on November 4th we went to Applebee's for my Birthday my husband told the waiter it was my Birthday and he wished me a happy Birthday needless to say nothing was said or done after that. I was disappointed as well as my husband the young man wasn't very attentive as he could have been. Dinner was very good never the less.</review>

<Text>I dont know what's going on with Applebee's! First, we were told that there is a 10 minute wait  when I counted 12 tables that can accomodate 4 people.  Then it took 30 minutes to get the appetizers and another 30 minutes to get part of our order (1 hour wait for the main dish).  Such a disappointment!<//Text>< pics>

<review>As we arrived we were told to wait 10mins when we actually waited 20. The assistant manager was very disorganised and didn't know what she was doing.

When we were seated all the waiters were round the back and then they all stormed out leaving only 3 people left in the restraunt. Who had to serve the rest of the customers by them selves. After 10mins they finally came back and they didn't look happy.

Although the bar tender who stayed seemed to be very happy and the customers seemed pleased with his service.

When the food finally came my pasta dish took 10mins longer then the rest of the dishes served.

Having said all this the food was fantastic and very filling.

EDIT: I would contact however were flying back to England<//review></record>

Getting worse! I’m a “regular” I live really close by. I used to go every Tuesday night after work but seems like they just choose to keep customers away. They technically slapped the door on my face at 11:29 pm (when they “normally” close at 12)
Not a place to go no more</Review>

I come to applebee's in napa on a decently regular basis either with family or my fiancé and we've always had a great time. Between the fun conversations with the waiters and the great quality of the food, Applebee's napa has always given me a reason to come back for more.</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>The cutlery was dirty, the shrimp tasted expired, waitress was abrasive and not attentive. I had to ask for water for 4 times. Food was cold. Machine to play games , was broken. Waitress sat at another table with customers  and had a conversation while we waited to pay the bill. Waitress brought a hot chocolate that was over flowing and spilling and placed it in front of my son and just kept walking by as I was cleaning it up. Horrible experience, couldn't wait to leave!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

I placed an order online first off it was 15 minutes longer for my order to be ready than the time said, nobody even came to tell me it was going to take longer, then I get home and I have no dressing for my salad I asked for extra ranch and got none and my shrimp came with no sauce.<//review>
