This review is for the coffee shop part.

This is true espresso bar with great quality. I enjoy lighter/medium roast espressos and they have that. They took extra care for making a shot with good solid crema. I recommend this for espressos and keep going back.

The staff was welcoming and well serving.

There are enough of outside seating.

They down side that they close the espresso bar before they close the skate board side. If shop was to close at 6pm then bar closed 3:20pm already. The store hours does not reflect that and could make a trip that does not end with great cup of espresso.<//review>

Grab a seat in the sunshine beaming down the Paseo with a fantastic cup of tea or coffee, be it drip, espresso, or cappuccino—all in a legendary skate shop in the heart of downtown San José. Be sure to say hello to Bob, a local legend and purveyor of quality beans and boards. It's a perfect spot to people watch and to support a truly local business.</Review>

Great coffee at the adjacent shop  with compostable cups & lids, cool pics on the walls and lots of natural light from the big glass windows everywhere.

Interesting health and #sustainability feature is that there's no dairy milk on offer only oat or  almond milk if needed with coffee. #vegan #plantbased

So much nicer to buy gear and coffee here than inside a shopping mall.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcs8IGNPY7ej7B-JxO6O0WVX7mYeXsYwfj-oER=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3PPj-5c9o1ABJC-t6EwYpnDmRp6ICpIKIGMYB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSHcTupJcxgfFGxkmysvXzFjG_nPOhdcR0FjNr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3S1T0FkP--u1DeLvFJyfterAY3-dGJrMseUMT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhRmjHWZdQ__1tGxgESC3Rr-f69holXSoGMyeB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuciZtFhHMvfJLDs1QIJF7pa1Hi8327-trgTD3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFWTO0tpvKT4dgCnzCxK4wGTEEqhgZ7qAJF70n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuyKsZQ0y7lt5dseuIJVqNTLH-qBviA5HXPER3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPE8YQGXH7Y8ZGTtRm48xBBqP3uQy5B0wX2K_ko=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT6WdQnla8dCZC3ObNuuBevi0kloAuYnQ1aqqL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbyLKei64YVZ69GxxWn2rQn0nSltrJYm0XqIUT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwGFKFCrgEYDiIe8C9zooL2FqXW_beT1nYU2mG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNW236F1QU-crOr_O6A8sFa4cbwOtrRananv9FX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjbbR-5oihqawTM9JEMJjpm77qmQTQAYAn34wT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fccbbd18aa865:0x53ec7b75291f7eae</GmapID></record>

<text>I haven’t really skated in like 5-7 years and I have walked by this place a hundred times. What a mistake I should have gone in the moment I saw it. Immediately was felt welcome and comfortable. Bob was incredibly nice and knowledgeable. Being a very tall and big guy he knew what I needed and recommended things even if he didn’t have them in stock. All I can say is that I will be going back for anything I need skating wise and next time I’ll try out the cafe .< /text></record>

< review>
In town over Thanksgiving and stopped in as we support all local skate shops. My wife and I were introduced to Bob who provided us with the most memorable customer service experience! He met us at the door, got to know us and opened the door as we departed. I can honestly say this was a Top 5 customer service experience in my lifetime. How my other places can you go, where after 5-10 minutes you feel like you have known someone for years? I will now go out of my way to go back to Circle-A and you should too. Just for the experience! New businesses should go or send new employees just for training! The shop has skateboard memorabilia and very cool off major label clothing and product like 101, curb nerd, etc. Thank you Bob for making up for all of the poor customer service experiences prior to this visit!<//review>

While heading towards the Post Office from the ABC office on Thursday morning, we saw an espresso machine through a window of the Circle-A skate shop. Which was curiously surprising.
Who would have thought that a skateboard retail space would have the best espresso in San Jose?
They use a serious Slayer LPX 2 group espresso machine with a bottomless portafilter, which I have never seen used in person. It only does double shots, but since we were getting quadruple shot Cappuccinos, it didn't matter.
The young gentleman new his craft and even though they didn't have milk or cream, he boasted the Oat milk/cream, which was just as tasty without killing the flavor of the espresso. Deeeeeelish!
Well done!< /Text>

I was really disappointed with my experience. I spent 70 dollars on a skateboard deck only to have it break in 2 days on a warm up trick. I’ve been skating for 5 years and have never seen anything like this happen. I’m not heavy either(roughly 130 pounds). I went in to the shop hoping to get a replacement deck or at least some money back but was told that nothing could be done. Horrible customer service.<//Text>
<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1587603008962, 'text': "Sorry, but like I said Nathaniel, no one would replace that board. Your board was clearly broken with NO defect showing. Had there been a separation in between the plies due to an air bubble in the glue spreading process things would be different, the board MFG would replace it for you. I simply saved you time and money by stating exactly what the Board Company would tell you. To back my knowledge in this situation, I've not only ran this retail store since 1997 but started Circle-A the brand as a board MFG(with my own wood shop) in 1986 and I have a personal relationship with the current top wood shops in the business today including the one that pressed your board with 5 straight grains and 2 cross grains of hard rock maple from the Great Lakes region of Vermont. So, if this is your first board break, I applaud you for your good luck because as you MUST know almost anybody that's been skateboarding(not longboarding) for five years has landed wrong and broke there board. As far as calling me out for horrible customer service, that is messed up. I was in the middle of helping another customer when you approached me with your deck in hand and I gave YOU my attention immediately. I'm sorry if that was not the answer you wanted to hear but it was the truth!\n\nAll I can tell you is: Bolts Kid! Land Bolts! #maybewatchsomeshaneoneill\nIt's All Love,\nBob"}<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Nicely laid out space.  I had a sample iced coffee on the plaza outside, tasty and refreshing.  Inventory always looks sparse to me.</Text>

I have been going here since I was a child. It's funny how nostalgic one can get when 20 years later still shopping at the same store.<//Review>

Best coffee spot in SJ - unfussy coffee from amazing locally roasted beans (truly for the coffee purist), really happy and friendly service and a light, contemporary space. I don't buy coffee anywhere else in SJ.</Text>

< review>
I love this restaurant food concept - fusion maybe if I have to describe it? The rice bun is a good concept as well. I ordered kamikaze fries and rice bowl ribs without any additions or taking out anything for the first time so I have a gauge on how I wanted to customize my next order. The rib flavor is good - it's on a sweet side (you might not be a fan or prefer your ribs with different flavor or more umami taste but I don't mind and I like their ribs how it is). The brown rice with furikake is great option for rice. The meat size, how it's all cut - is proportion for bite sizes which is nice. Basically the bowl concept has meat, rice, greens, and kimchi - I think for me it's a good healthy balance: I have my carbs, meat, green, and side. The fries has good flavor (a bit spicy for me - but that's me. Some prefer it spicy). The meat to fries ratio is enough to enjoy the flavor.  In regards to proportion and price - everyone has different standard on these so I'll let you decide on how you define these after you tried yours. Highly recommend to give Koja a try.
Kudos Koja for using environmental friendly take out box!</review>

This place will definitely make our regular rotation of go to's to eat at in Fremont. We tried a pork bowl, the original Koja sandwich with beef and the Kamikaze fries. All were full of flavor and had different flavor profiles. The staff was attentive and friendly.  The drink options were a little disappointing, but the food is worth it.</text>

Clean and efficient for take out services. Korean fusion fast food, variations on other ethnic food: tacos with Korean flair. Good prices, mild spices.< /Text>

Came here 10 mins before closing time and folks behind the counter were so nice and accommodating. Food was great too and definitely hit the spot. Highly recommend 👍🏼< /Review>

<Text>I love Koja kitchen! With this location, they have chunks of short rib instead of small pieces. I like the sauce and how they top it off with fish roe. The kamikaze fries are bomb. Also I noticed they have buns too for the burgers not just the rice kind.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I admire this spot! They offer delicious dishes, their menu is nice, The chef in that restaurant is a real authority in the kitchen, I enjoy very much eating all their dishes. The food is consistently fresh, the attitude towards the clients  is good. I often go to  this place and I was never disappointed.  I highly recommend it.< /text>

<text>Went here for picking up lunch earlier today. Overall the experience was straightforward. I ordered, then a few minutes later the food was ready.

I ordered their spicy chicken bowl and the musubi. The spicy chicken was good, and it definitely got some kick on it. It feels a bit over fried though. The rice also felt a bit overcooked. I probably won't order this again. The musubi was something else though. It has the sweet egg (tamagoyaki) and bacon in it, with the usual spam (the luncheon meat, not the one that you find in your computer). This is the first time I've had this variant and I must say I'm a big fan. I will definitely come back more for this!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Amazing food! Umami fries are delicious, and so are the Kamikaze fries. If you're a newbie, get the original koja burger. Once you're hooked start expanding your pallet.<//text>

Offers a wide variety of kojas, rice bowls, etc. A bit pricey but it’s worth it.

Kojas- The crispy rice patty for the kojas go well with the braised meat and vegetables. Would highly recommend.

Rice bowls- Slightly on the smaller side and you may get more bang for your buck at other places with similar offerings. Nevertheless, still delicious! Meat is always tender and rice is cooked perfectly.

Overall, I love stopping by this place for a quick lunch. The food is always high quality and the workers are friendly. Would recommend any of their kojas and Kamikaze Fries!< /Review>

I ordered the short rib bowl, which is the most popular in the bowl section per the staff. Everything on the menu sounded delicious. Of course,  I had to narrow it down to one dish.

The meat was tender and had lots of flavor. It went well with the Kimchi.

There's no table service so the flow is you order @ the counter, then they'll give you a pager. To pick up your order, it'll be ready on the side, near the beverage machine. They serve beer too!

There's many large screen TV's so every seat is great one. Also, there's patio seating too! Great find, we'll be back!< /Text>

If you've never been here, you really owe it to yourself to try this Korean Fusion restaurant.

My favorite items are the Korean BBQ beef Taco and the Miso Braised Pork Tacos. Equally enjoyable are the Korean Spicy Wings and the Umami Fries.

Today was part of their soft open, I believe. I ordered the original Koja "Burger", which is their short rib beef in between two rice patty buns. Delicious! I also ordered their Umami Fries, which were very good as well.</text>

This review is only for the teriyaki burger - rice was great, but the patty tastes bad. The actual food looks different from the picture. It doesn't taste like chicken. more like imitation crab meat... portion was very small.< /review>

We've liked rice "buns" since having them at Mos Burger in Japan, and KoJa Kitchen's KoJas have these. I ordered the beef KoJa and umani fries, and two people had the pork KoJa and kamikaze fries. The cashier was efficient and added masago from one KoJa to another. We sampled each others' food and everything was all very tasty.</review></record>

Koja Kitchen's long awaited opening has arrived! I have visited this location twice since opening. The staff are all very friendly, and are open to giving recommendations. I usually order the original koja and some DMZ wings! If you like spicy, I totally recommend the wings. I also really like the kamikaze fries, but make sure to ask for extra sauce!<//text>

Came earlier with hopes of eating a burger with rice patties but for some reason they came with regular buns. I didn't realize until way later and I hadn't suspected anything because I order the same thing and they come with the rice patties usually. I wish the staff had said something in advance. I specifically came here because I had been craving the rice patties and I treat myself once a month to a meal outside. I'm beating myself down over it but it made me realize how expensive the burgers and fries are for ~30 bucks. Lesson learned, I won't come back.< /Review>

food truck food gone upscale. I had the beef koja burger and my son had the original short rib version. both came with rice cakes buns. the koja burger was too sweet for me. the original less so due to bigger pieces of meat absorbing less of what tasted like the same sauce. different? yes. good? not for me.  maybe if you like heavily sauced food. at least the beer helped wash it down< /Text>

We had walked past this place multiple times in the last month or so, and we decided to try them out.  Great Korean/American mix flavors of meats and favs like burgers and tacos.  We tried the kamakazi fries and chicken taco and musubi, and they were all very good.</Text>

<Text>Been looking for tint services for a good while and I just got to say, I'm very glad that I went with Professional Window Tinting. They definitely take pride in their work and have top notch products customer service. They know the regulations regarding tint and actually use nano carbon or nano ceramic tint. Definitely highly recommend their services.<//Text>< Resp>

After shopping around, this place caught my attention due to the amount of Tesla vehicles they tinted based on customer reviews. I was afraid of receiving a 2 piece film tint on the rear window.  Antonio gave me a great deal on 2 vehicle for ceramic tinting that I could not resist.  The quality of the tint looks great without any bubbles or fade.  The overall staff there was super friendly, clean environment, and excellent customer service.  Highly recommend this place to anyone and I do plan on returning in the near future.  Thanks Professional Windows Tinting and keep up the great work!<//Text>

<review>By far the best place to get your car tinted! They’re professional, very friendly and they have really reasonable prices. I’ve gotten two cars done by them so far and the tint is high quality film. They have speedy service, they  get you in and out fast. My Nissan Maxima is looking amazing. Highly recommend!<//review>< pictures>

I had both my cars done here, as well as my cousin’s car. Each time the outcome was top notch 👌🏼 I had my Mazda tinted way back when they used to be on Oxnard Blvd, my cousin’s Subie just a few years ago, and I just had my BMW done today. Wouldn’t trust anyone else! Thank you Antonio

It's been almost two years since I had my windows tinted here and they're doing fantastic. No complaints at all. Would and have recommended, 100%

Had some initial issues getting in touch for an appt, but eventually we got it dialed in. Timing estimate was fair, space was tidy and offered a carpeted area for children, with play area, when I was there. Very satisfied with my experience and will go here again on my next vehicle.< /review>

Fantastic. Glad I trusted these 97 five star reviews. Was in there today getting my daughter’s windows tinted. Clean. Friendly people. Good price. In and out. And they didn’t have a two week waiting time. I always judge a business by how well they treat women going in alone. They got an A+! The windows look fantastic! Highly recommend.</Text>

The team at “professional window tinting“ is the best.  Their prices are extremely competitive and the workmanship is second to none!

They offer the best ceramic tint on the market!  It was a pleasure doing business with them.</review>

<review>Excellent place to get your windows tinted. It is in a nice quiet area, you wouldn't think it was a car place. I got my Prius tinted here 2 months  ago with the ceramic paper and they did an excellent job. I didn't mind the wait because I watched a series on Netflix while I waited.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdjW9dbH9PKOo1jqTjhjzW31KGLc2veVxOZU16=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyqKv2XMnss0E6Y9jHRh6eAfKewo35FGcKLgqj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

Brought in my 2018 Nissan Altima this morning and I must admit I LOVE the work that this team has done with my window tint! Very professional and friendly staff, they definitely take care of you with their reasonable prices and great service. On top of their great service they have an awesome waiting room which I loved! Free movies, WiFi, toys for the kids, and of a course a comfortable couch. 👌</Review>

Wow,  so many places to choose from and this one stands up top. Very friendly and fast. I called and I didn’t need an appointment. Waited on their waiting room where a Dad of one of them was relaxing. Had a very pleasant conversation which may me feel like home. Them they drove my truck over and I love it. The Quality and profession of this guys, makes you spread their work. Other places do different things, while this one specializes in Tint only. Highly recommended to anybody. Thanx and God bless your Business 🙏🏼<//Text>

Not sure about other competitive prices, but they do a really good job with window tinting.< /Review><user>115815287527468977355< /user></record></dataset><record>

We work with 4 different types of high quality film you can give me a call at 8052170716 and we can make an appointment for you to come down and bring your vehicle along with your receipt.

<text>My fiancee bought a new car, first thing needed was to tint the windows.  Did not think twice about where to go. My family and I have been customers of Professional window tinting for many many years. Since previous location on 5th st in Oxnard. We have always been treated as priority. They have a friendly staff and the prices are reasonable. The quality in  their work meets 100% of our expectations. I highly recommend Professional window tinting to all my friends and family!<//text><userid>108419863438549212483<//userid></record></dataset><record>

I'm very picky about who touches my car, these guys did a great job! They're very professional, their rates are competitive and they got the job done quickly. I would highly recommend them for any window tinting job you need!

Then after seeing what an excellent job they do I decided to do all of my windows on my vehicle ( decided to do factory tinted windows). I would highly reccomend these guys. Their prices were very good as well. Ill always take my vehicles here in the future. Thanks guys!<//text>< pics>

<Review>In the last 6 months, I have had 4 cars tinted here and I can’t begin to express how much I appreciate the level of detail The owner puts into each job.  Not only is he good at what he does but he is also very fair with his prices and he has options for every budget. In short, I am never taking my vehicles anywhere else. Try them, u will be very happy you did.< /Review><UserId.>109778618931600300269< /UserId.><GmapID>0x80e84e82981f4e89:0xcab221ce7ab37574</GmapID>< Response>

I got the ceramic tint and I am very happy with the final result and price. I don't have any bubbles and I would say the job is 9/10. I would definitely come back and buy again.</text>

Very professional and friendly approach  I got my windows tinted for two, toyota Camry & Corolla. Gave me discount. Also explained very well the difference in the film qualities.  Was very assuring and gave 5 years warranty.
I had enquired at two other places for price before I decided to get work done here.<//review>

<Review>I called them up on Sunday at 10:30 and asked if they would be able to get my brand new Cadillac Escalade ESV in same day.  They said no problem bring it in at 12 and give us 3 hours.  I brought it in and Eric did an amazing job and was done in just a little over 2 hours!  The car looks amazing and I would absolutely recommend this shop to anyone looking to get their windows tinted great service great product and great price!< /Review>< rate>

<review>I bought a 2015 Toyota HighLander yesterday and needed the front windows tinted. I took a chance with this venue because my shop was closed. I spoke to Ismael who was very prompt and professional making my appointment.  I dropped off my suv with Erick who was very busy with 2 vehicles but multitasking and very attentive towards me. I had many questions about factory tinted windows and Erick educated me and recommended what was best for my vehicle.  I only had to wait a few hours. I was super impressed with his workmanship. I'm even going to buy hid fog lights from G stereos for my ride and Erick recommended in house products that would further meet my needs. Thank you Erick and I will be sending you business.<//review><date>1430712424124<//date>< rate>

I have had two cars tinted here in the past three weeks. As far as I am concerned, this is the best place in the county to get your car windows tinted. These guys are very professional and I would recommend them highly.<//Text>

< Review>
I had an appointment made at Obsessionz in Camarillo that I made a week in advance advising them I was taking off two extra days from work over President's Day weekend and wanted my windows tinted. No problem I was told--they were open President's Day. Drove over there and they said they were booked and were very rude saying we said NEXT Monday. Not so. Why would we ask if they were open President's Day then? Furious we made a phone call to Professional Window Tinting after reading Yelp reviews of 4 and 5 stars so called them and they took us in ON President's Day even though there were two cars ahead of us and they tinted our 2012 black Dodge Charger Superbee with superb experience and over the top friendliness. I absolutely would recommend these folks to anyone--the price was very reasonable with a lifetime guarantee as well. Thank you guys!<//Review>

Came here to share my review and saw the long list of one star reviews. Accurately describes this spot. We rented a manager's special car, which is "compact or larger". We were given a car with stains all over the driver's seat, and smelled like urine. In the middle of COVID.

Requested a change and were told that we should just take the car because we got an "upgrade". What we got was an old, stained, dirty car that was mid-size, and therefore falls under the "compact or larger" that we reserved - NOT an upgrade. When I again requested a clean car, we were told that we had to wait 15 mins, despite the multiple cars sitting in the parking lot. I then overheard the lady requesting an Economy car for us (which is smaller than a Compact and not included in the range of cars for our reservation). Went back to the desk and asked why an Economy car was requested when we booked Compact or larger, and the man pictured flat out lied to my face and said she requested a "manager's special". I absolutely did not mishear "manager's special" as "economy".
He then said we could either cancel the reservation, take the "upgraded" dirty car, or wait for the new one.
As he said verbatim: "I know what I'm doing."
Yeah, what you're doing is lying, buddy.</text>

Don't be fooled by the lower prices Dollar offers. I rented an Intermediate Class car three weeks in advance. It was over 40 minute wait in line to then be told I'd have to wait "5 minutes to an hour" for a car or upgrade for more money. There were people that had been waiting for a car longer than the 40 + minutes I'd been waiting to get to the counter. The upgrade offered was "for a good price". It has always been my experience to receive an upgrade for free when the car rented in advance is not available. I asked several times why they couldn't give a free upgrade when it was their fault for not having the vehicle I rented. I was just told that "no free upgrades".  If I hadn't had my hungry and tired child with me, I might have waited, but I ended up spending $300 more for a car.  At least I got a car. From other reviews many don't end up with a car and have to deal with being refunded. Don't go here. It's not worth it. I will be putting a complaint with the BBB.< /review>

The worst car rental place.  I mistakenly asked for a compact rental.  When I noticed my mistake, I requested an upgrade to a mid-size.  The Representative gave me a similar compact.  I then cancelled all reservations/EVERYTHING!  The representative wrote void across my reservation and didn't cancel the charge.  3 hours later,  customer service sent a request for the store to cancel and refund my card.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!!<//text>

Hertz Dollar or Thrifty it’s all the same manager at the desk. Everything about this location is upsetting. It’s never a smooth transaction. Almost makes me think they don’t want me to have a good experience. These guys kindly tell you “oh well” when face with a problem. Everybody acts like they didn’t want to come to work.
4/18/21 Who cares if you made a reservation for 6am? They don’t have vehicles so you have to wait for a return. Better hope it’s clean.< /review>

I have never had a worse experience in my life. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Charles from Dollar rental in the Sacramento was the meanest, rudest person I have ever met. I’ve never worked with anyone so unprofessional and just flat out mean. When we called for our reservation they said all their SUVs came with 4 wheel drive. We were going up a mountain so we needed the 4 wheel drive and they guaranteed they’d have it. When we get there not only did they say they have no four wheel drives but Charles pretty much said you’re beat take this 2 wheel drive or wait for a four wheel which could take hours. (We had two toddlers with us who had already traveled 6 hours). He was really just so mean and left us in tears and he couldn’t care less about the fact that they had screwed us. Go anywhere else.< /review>

<Review>Horrible Service. I cannot get a receipt nor any personnel representative on the phone. I have waited 3 days. This was a military duty that was performed and the car was returned. at the time of return there was no one there for checking in the car nor any directions on how to return the cars. Several people doing the morning return were confused at the process and lack of help.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Absolutely Terrible! They over charged me! I had prepaid through Travelocity, I was expecting to be charged for remaining gas& taxes.... instead I found Dollar had charged me for the full amount! I called customer service, and the basically said "too bad, so sad" and refused a refund or credit. I rent cars several times a month for work and I have never experienced such BS</Text>

Arriving after 16 hours of travel to reach my mother's deathbed, dollar had no cars for anybody, including prepaid reservations.  This after I had modified my reservation and agreed to double the cost to start my rental one day earlier (5 days instead of 4).  That was already low, but dollar kept digging.  Thank God for Uber.  My disgust with dollar is profound.<//text>

Worst car rental experience ever!!!  I booked a car ahead of time. Got in on time. Then waited in their line for 90 minutes!!!!  Only to be told they have no cars!!!!! What kind of a shoddy outfit is this!?????  Note to self. NEVER rent from Dollar!!!! I wish I could give them NO stars. Don’t do it. I wish I had read these reviews first.<//Review>

Oh I knew there was a reason I just stick with my other Enterprise. I am seeing a lot of reviews with long waits for cars and invalid charges. My experience currently is this...

I come to Sacramento, CA frequently to visit my sons. Since I visit for an extended duration having a vehicle is critical to actually seeing them. I always book my rental car reservations online ahead of time as transportation is critical to the amount of local travel I have to do. Being that it is a holiday weekend, there is an even greater importance to secure your reservation ahead of time, so as the consumer I have effectively completed my responsibility of the transaction. I arrive to SMF airport to the wonderful news that Dollar, Hertz, and National (which all operate together) have no cars. To be clear, I have prepaid $356 (remember this amount) to ensure that I have transportation, but somehow I have no car. So, now I am essentially stranded at the Sacramento Airport. As a rental car company this is an unacceptable failure. I travel often, and if this happened in a city that I did not know people, I could only imagine the cost I would incur, but I did not have to imagine for long.

Now let's get into their customer service on addressing this issue. I am a reasonable person and understand that things happen. The important thing is the solutions that you bring to the table to rectify the situation. Dollar failed at this as well. Let me be clear, at no point during this entire transaction have I been rude, loud, or use any degrading/derogatory language.

Instead of cancelling my reservation at the counter and refunding my money, they handed me a pamphlet and said I would have to call their Customer Service (A loosely used term) department in order to get a refund. Then the lady told me that I could go down to the Avis counter to ask if I could rent a car there. Also if there was not a rental car down there, to come back and she would see what she could do for me. I am confused why we are not seeing what we can do for me before I leave the counter, but again, transportation is critical for this week long visit.

I proceed down to Avis rental car and they do in deed have a rental available. I assume that I will have to pay a premium for the rental as again it is a holiday weekend, and demand is high. I was not ready for the price gouging that was about to take place... To rent a vehicle for the same duration, the price of my rental with Avis would be $1,300 (365% increase). To make matters worse, if I rented from Friday Thru Tuesday (instead of Friday to the following  Saturday) the rental would cost $1,100. So for cutting my car rental by 5 days, would reduce the price by only $200. That math just doesn't add up. For those prices I could buy an old car off the street to use for the week. To make matters worse Avis said that Dollar had the no car issue all week. Basically, I could have been contacted ahead of time so that I could make other arrangements. None the less, back to Dollar I go...

I get back to the agent counter and the only thing they offer me is to take my number down to call me if a car comes in between 5:30 pm and 11:30 pm. As far as figuring out my transportation issue, it is apparent that is not their problem. I walk out to call the alleged Customer Service Department. You guessed it, closed.

This morning, I wake up to a charge on my account from Dollar and call during business hours only to get the same message. I find another number and the lady tells me that I am already a day into my rental after I had already told her everything. Then she offers the emptiest apology that I have ever heard and says I can go back to see if a car is now available. Also, my money will be refunded in 7 to 10 business days since I chose to cancel my reservation. I would give you 0 stars if I could, but the review won't allow me to. You have forever lost my business, and please save your automated review responses. Based on my interactions with your representatives, I know that there is no compassion for my inconvenience.

Wow! All of the reviews below completely explained my experience with Dollar Rental. I had a reservation for 9/03/20 - 9/07/20 for Labor Day weekend. I was traveling to Sacramento for the holiday weekend to spend time with my partner. We arrived to the car rental at  8:30 PM on 9/3/20. We noticed multiple people laying and sitting around with a long line. We saw multiple customers who spoke with the reps at Dollar Rental were getting upset and argumentative. We figured there were problems with their reservations. Little did we know, it was an ongoing issue with everyone’s reservation. The rep told us there were no more cars for the rest of the night and that no cars were returned due to the California fires. My partner and I were mind blown and upset that we were not notified prior to our scheduled reservation. The rep said there was nothing he could do, and everyone laying and sitting around were people who have been waiting for cars since early morning and they would be the first to get the returned cars. The rep stated that we are more than welcome to come back tomorrow at 5 AM and that he was positive they would have cars returned by that time. He handed us a pamphlet and told us to call customer service if we wanted our refund.

This was such an inconvenient and horrible experience. I understand unforeseen situations can occur, but it was upsetting that we were not notified of the issue prior to arriving. Not only that, there was a long line of people waiting and this was wasting other’s time. There were no signs posted of the issue. You literally had to stay in line and when it was your turn, they’ll tell you “sorry, there are no more cars” and hand you a pamphlet.

My partner and I debated on getting an Uber and coming back the next morning. Luckily, my partner has family in Sacramento and his sisters were kind enough to let us borrow their car for the weekend. It’s hard to imagine if this occurred in another city or state where we didn’t know anyone. I have called customer service every week since the incident. I finally received my refund on 9/23/20. This was my first experience with Dollar and will be my last.< /text>

< Review>
The WORST car rental experience of my life. We rented a car from Sept 8th- 12th. But the oregon wildfires had us cancel all our plans.

I booked online for $247. When my sister arrived to pick up the car, it was $318. She picked me up, n when she told me how much it was, I told her that's wrong. Apparently, they add an $85 loss damage waiver. That wasnt explained to my sister. The man asked if she wanted insurance for $45 more a day. She said no, and that was that.

Since we returned the car 2 days early, they charge you $25. We didnt get any money back. In fact, we paid more for only having the car for 3 days. This is actual B.S. why would you take advantage of people who had to return early because of the wild fires?<//Review>

<Text>Use extreme caution when renting from Dollar at Sacramento Airport.   Make sure you get a receipt when you drop off your car.   Make sure you save your gas receipt.   We are currently attempting to get a false fuel charge refunded of $80.    Wonder if this is a pattern?   Good thing I was paying attention!< /Text><Time>1572283853890< /Time><Pics>None</Pics></record>

The price was just right for the amount of days and the representatives are very friendly and professional.  I waited over an hour to get through the lines to pick up my rental at Sacramento airport but for the price, I would expect that they were busy and the team was doing what they can to get the people through.  What I was disappointed with was my full size rental.  With the amount of customers that go through them, I would expect exterior damages to the vehicle but no one did a walk through until I requested one.  Also,
the vehicle smelled like the last party smoked weed in it and I told the rep when she did a walk through and she notated it.  The odor lingered the whole time that I had the rental.  Should I say...you get what you paid for?< /text>

THEY OVERCHARGED ME!
Be careful because their rates are looking cheaper than others, they will screw you at the end.
I rented a car for three day on January 5th 2020 from Dollar rent a car in Sacramento airport. I picked up the car at the airport with full tank of gas and after three days I filled up the tank full at the gas station right when you are entering the airport. The person picked up the car from me, looked around the car and checked the odometer etc. and told me I am good to go. She didn't tell me anything else, she didn't give me any receipt saying everything is good. I was bit skeptical but I said ok and left. Next day I checked my emails and saw that they sent me an email with receipt and when I checked what I paid I saw that they charged extra me $ 46.20 for Fuel and service. Right away I called their customer service and told them I returned the car full tank of gas , same as I received. The rep told me sorry about the situation. They can refund my money but I have to send the receipt to Hertz rent a car ( I guess Dollar rent a car is part of Hertz) and they could refund my money. I said you guys already have the receipt what is the purpose of it, wasting more of my time after charging me extra in snaky way. I told the person I refuse to do it. No w I can see the purpose what they do all that. First , they will charge you extra and you will not notice it and they will get away with it. second and or, they will tell you they can refund your money but you have to follow their company policy and procedure  and waste more of your time because of their mistake or GREED so they could steal your money if you refuse to follow all the paper work.
I said I am not doing the paper work because you guys are ugly company. I rather never use your service again , hopefully some people read this review and never use them too. Yes, they stole $ 46.20 from me, but I believe there is karma, I will not die because of $ 46 but I am sure they will loose more customers because the way they treat the people.
Shame on you Dollar rent a car, and Hertz as you are the same company.<//Review>

This place was THE worst rental experience I ever had. I got to the counter at my scheduled time and they told me to wait for the SUV we had reserved as it was "in another lot". 15 minutes goes by and I go to the counter. I ask where the car is and the guy says they are getting the car. I tell him I will get it myself. He says no "it's being serviced". OK so..is it not ready or in another lot? He couldn't tell me. He then offered me a full size car for the same price (I paid for an SUV). I stormed off to another rental place and miraculously I was flagged down as the car was ready. We were escorted out the door to an SUV that was sitting there the whole time. The car was dented all over. I asked for a damage form. The guy breathed heavily and said "its inside, I'll go get you one if you feel you need it". Yes, I do after all this. Appears they are running a scam to try to reserve their "premier" cars when they can. Avoid if at all possible.< /review>

I love Dollar Rent A Car I always used them in the past them and Thrifty I think they usually have the best deals the only thing is they don't accept secured credit cards and if you're going to use your debit card I believe you have to put down a $350 deposit so it's best if you have a credit card to just use that because that's how you get the best deals. And at this location since it's an airport location you can't use your debit card anyway unless you have an outgoing flight if you don't have an outgoing flight they will not let you use a debit card to rent a car so you have to have a credit card if you're just going to the airport to rent a car from Thrifty or dollar hope that saves someone a trip up there.< /text>

<Review>Be ready to wait for an hour for your rental car. Extremely slow service, long lines and no customer service whatsoever. May be worth the savings for you though- just be warned. Can't speak to how the car is and what it's like returning it. I'm writing this while I'm in line; yes I'm so bored and waiting for so long that I pulled out my computer to write this.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1579408908238, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to rate & tell us about your experience with us, Ann.

Do not rent your car here unless you want to get ripped off! I was told if I turned my car in two days early it would be $371 and when I showed up they charged me $518. No meet in the middle, no negotiating. Pay or they will make you pay. Trash people working for a trash company.</text>

My family and I take a vacation every year, swapping out time-share location frequently, in which we will rent a car during our one week stay. Needles to say, we have had both positive and negative experiences with different car rental companies. However, the great experience with Dollar/Thrifty out of Sacramento was one of the best I've had so far. The car that I had reserved was the one I had chosen, and the courteous staff was very easy to deal with, both with the pick-up and return which was hassle free. I definitely will use them for next years trip!< /review>

< review>
I rented a car here via Expedia and while I was happy for the free upgrade to a larger car, I was NOT happy that  with their refueling process. I was told to bring the car back with the same amount of fuel it left with and I did just that. But, they still charged me for fuel and kept writing me saying that I didn't return it full. Of course, I didn't return it full, I didn't get it full. It appears they aren't even reading what I'm typing. So, I'm going to write about it here and suggest that if you rent a car, rent from a company with better customer service or demand a full tank at the beginning of the rental so when you return it, it's easy to simply fill up the tank.<//review>

The premium SUV that I rented and have a confirmation number for is suddenly not available and they refuse to let me speak to a supervisor or manager to fix the problem. Don't rent with this company!<//Review>

<text>I flew in Sacramento on 1/30 and rented a mid-size car from Dollar. As usual I was greeted upon arrival, and was out the door to my car pretty quickly. It probably helps that I am an Express member.
Upon return, my checkout was under 3 minutes. Seriously!
I always use Dollar for my rentals....fair price and great service!< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Steer clear
I literally walked up to get my car as the lady(supervisor) calls another customer foolish for not wanting to pay an extra day by turning it in early.
Clearly she's in contract, but calling a customer names?
Anybody that treats customers that way, wont get my money, don't let them get yours.< /Review>< Response>

OMG!! I was running a bit late and a dollar person personally drove me directly to my departure location at the airport so that I didn't have to wait for the shuttle.wow! That took off so much stress on my trip and saved 20 minutes which I Really needed at that point. I am entirely impressed!!! what awesome customer service. I will definitely be renting from Dollar again. Super fast check in and check out and very friendly staff!<//Review>

<Text>My only complaint is the same complaint for literally *all* rental car companies at this time:  Even if you can get a listing for a particular local rental desk at a particular airport or city location, you CAN NOT ever reach the location directly by phone.  They will always bounce you to a "national call center".  So for example, if your flight arrives late and you need to definitively find out that the rental desk will be held open for special holiday hours, forget it.  The friendly person at the call center will tell you something non-committal, and you won't really get your answer.  So this time, I rolled the dice, and luckily the local desk at my destination was held open an additional hour.  I wonder if these companies will ever figure out that they are losing business when people decide against that risk... Thank you for listening :)</Text>< pictures>

Over all good experience.  No surprise charges.  They accept debit cards but will hold ~25% of total amount of charges until car is returned (If card has visa logo;  other logos require  $300 deposit, regardless of total amount). It went smooth.
Next time I will spend the extra few bucks to upgrade from compact- they are as basic as they come!</Text>

Picking up the car was easy from the SMF airport with a shuttle that takes you to the car rental area. The agent helping me was very nice. Returning the car was simple, I just pulled into a lane that as empty and in a minute a man checked for damage and that the gas tank was full then we were on our way.</Text>

Even with the extra insurance the agent talked me into, the cost of the car was less than half what the agency I usually use would have charged me.  It was very convenient, and the car was just fine.  Next time, I likely wouldn't go along with the arm-twisting tactics of the agent regarding the insurance.  Seems to be a habit, possibly encouraged by the company??< /text>

<resp>None<//resp><user_id>116784663513846426342<//user_id><Text>Had a car reserved in advance, arrived on time mid-day (Saturday of Labor Day weekend). There was a long line at Dollar/Thrifty, and virtually no lines at all of the other car rental stations. After about 30 minutes we made it up to the counter, the agent took our info & credit card, then told us to "stand over there," in the jumbled crowd of other folks & their suitcases who had been in line ahead of us. Our car would be ready "in about 10 minutes."  We waited for a good half hour, then wandered outside to see what was going on. It turns out they didn't have any cars on the lot, and we were all waiting for cars to be returned. I talked with the representatives behind the other rental counters who all said they were out of cars as well. The big difference is that they had taken care of all of their reservations; Dollar was the ONLY company that hadn't done the math in advance, as we all had reservations. It took TWO HOURS to finally get a car, and the first set of keys they gave us was for a vehicle that wouldn't start. How about a little business management, Dollar? All of us in the "waiting zone" were frustrated and irritated, if not worse. Not even a bottle of water was offered. Major fail, Dollar. We'll never be back.<//Text>< Pics>

I rent an average of 2-3 each month. As an express member I often get great rates.I also get to avoid the long lines at the inside counter. The counter staff are always friendly and helpful and I am always greeted by name. In less than 5 minutes I am checked out with the vehicle I reserved.  And sometimes If my vehicle isn't ready I get an upgrade to the next class. Thanks  Sandy and counter team, . Returning thevehicle is equally great. Recently I've had  the magical service of Emily.Again I'm greeted by name and with a smile. They check the mileage and gas and condition of vehicle and you're on your way with a final bill sent to my e-mail. Seriously folks, Dollar Express is the way to go!!.and worth its weight in pure gold. Feel like a Rock Star!</text>

Reserved a car a week ahead of time. Upon turning the car in they charged me more than double the reservation price in additional undisclosed fees.

Also charged me for a cracked windshield that spread from a rock chip already there. Entire car smelled of mold and would severely fog up everytime it was started, so I had to run the defrost which is what caused the rock chip to spread.

I called the rental company and spent over an hour on hold without being able to talk to a representative. This forced me to drive the majority of my trip with the cracked windshield, risking me and my family's safety as well as a ticket.

This is a shady company who wants to make a quick buck and is concerned about safety or legal vehicle requirements.</text>

<review>Poor terminal efficiency

Why does this car rental terminal need people walking keys around? I need to wait 30 minutes for my rental car because someone needs to walk slowly around between locations with the keys. Leave them in the car and notify the front desk when the car is ready. There's already a gate to check out. I don't understand all the redundancy. Worst car rental terminal experience I've ever encountered.

Giving at least another star for the people at the counter who were courteous. The operations manager for this site needs to redo this design. Pathetic.< /review><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Staff was friendly and helpful, however, the upholstery on the seats wasn't clean.  Also, the outside person didn't do a pre-check of possible scratches or dents, the way they do at my car dealership.

I returned it late at night, so the recording overhead told me to leave a note with my name, mileage, and whether the gas tank was full or not. So we did as we were told.  No one was in sight as it was nearly midnight.</review>

Compact doesn't include cruise control!  Had a new rep and he took forever and then didn't explain all the charges. Pre-paid fuel is a ripoff as even on the airport fuel was .20-.30 lower.
I still have to call customer service for something else. Not my favorite!<//text>

Will not rent from the dollar car rentals at Sacramento airport again. I was offered a free upgrade, took it & was charged nearly $80.00 extra. Up is never free. Great car though.< /review>

I'd give a zero of I could. If you make a reservation make it for 3 hours earlier than you need it and you might get lucky. Worst service ever.  Do not recommend</Review>

I enjoyed driving the little Toyota Yaris. It performed well and got great gas mileage. The car was also very clean. I could not figure out how to adjust outside side mirrors. I drive a Toyota Rav 4 and did not notice the same set up. I think it would be great if rental staff asked customers before they left the lot if they needed any help in determining where the lights are, how to use the radio, mirror adjustments, etc.

I signed up for the car on-line for a 3 day rental. When I got to the counter at Sacramento Airport I was told I had only signed up for 1 day. And that the rate I was quoted was only for 1 day and I would have to pay double that amount/day for the 3 day rental. This felt like a set up to me.  I paid more than I should have for this little car.</text>

<text>A friend of mine flew in from out of state. She had a reservation. When she went to pick her car she was told that she needed to make a $350 deposit which is more than 3x her entire 3 day rental. She doesn't have the funds, and dollar wouldn't take payment for the deposit  over the phone from me or her husband.

Do not rent from Dollar!<//text>< pics>

Am really hating follow up customer service. The car rental was fine. I think I left a valuable camera in the vehicle. Am trying to contact the Sacramento office. No luck. Have been through four time consuming phone menus only to be put in a queue which is experiencing long wait times. I actually saw agents pick up the phone while I was booking the vehicle prolonging my wait for the rental. Why can't I just call the office directly?</Review>

They don't inspect cars or in the shady business of collecting damage money off of as many people as they can.  3 months after rental they are trying to collect on damage I didn't do.  Pictures don't seem to help.  Damage was obvious and couldn't have been missed.  I don't think there is any misunderstanding or mistake here, just bad business practices or more likely a scam that is not financially worth fighting.< /text>

We returned the rental.  The gas needle shows that it's full, but the clerk insist that we show her the receipt that we've filled  the gas tank. I thought that it was very nonsense.  This is the one time that I didn't grab the gas receipt at the gas station and of course they needed to see proof that we filled the tank. She charged us  extra for the gas because we have no proof of the gas receipt to show her. We are very disappointed.  Oh well. Lesson learned.  Hang on to your gas receipt just in case. Very poor customer service.<//Review>

<Text>When I returned the car I was told that the battery in the scanner was being charge and to just leave the car. Since the shuttle was there and I didn't want to miss my flight I left.
When I received my copy from the return I had been charged for re fueling. I left a car that had been refueled. I contacted Dollar and sent them a copy of the gas station receipt. I haven't heard back.

<review>Car was a Mitsubishi Mirage. Lots of road noise. The three cylinder motor was noisy and ran rough. The steering felt like I was driving on jello. The main issue was no cruise control; I'm surprised it had A/C and power windows. To return the car at SMF you need to go to the Hertz car return, but Dollar doesn't tell you this. Lesson learned, don't rent economy cars from Dollar.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT Sacramento Airport location. I called the company directly twice days ahead of time to double check and ensure I had the needed amount available on my credit card for the deposit fee at pick up, they assured me twice of what the charge would be. When we arrived on they informed me that what their employee told me on the phone was incorrect and it would actually be substantially more. Over a $100 more actually. Now that is a miscommunication on their part, not mine, and the counter gentlemen was extremely rude and unhelpful.  He didn't apologize or express concern at our inconvenience. When I asked to speak to a supervisor he rolled his eyes at me and walked away grumbling.  Then the supervisor who came over was worse. He couldn't answer any basic clarifying questions on why their company gave me wrong information and He also didn't offer any solutions to resolve the issue. He basically didn't care and has no interest in providing even the most basic customer service. So at this point I walked away and called the company directly, I explained the situation, and again the employee told me that the hold they'd put on my card would x amount, not the amount the guy at the counter was trying to charge me. So when I asked why I was getting different information the woman I was speaking to hung up on me.  So we simply walked to the the next counter and National accomadated us with a smile, kindness, ease, and within 10 mins. We should have received the same polite service with Dollar. I understand companies have mix ups and wrong information given accidentally, but how every single one of your employees handled it was just completely unacceptable. Had anyone,  ay any point just apologized and said, oh I'm so sorry that happened, what can I do to fix it, or maybe we can modify your reservation or payment type etc. But no, they did nothing and offered no solutions. We will NEVER take our business to Dollar Rent A Car again. It was very clear that customer service was of zero concern to your employees.< /Review><response>None< /response>< Date>

If I could give it a 0 I would. If there is any young people that are under the age of 25 don't rent from here. My bf is 23 and they charged extra which is understandable because he is "under aged" which was 7 almost 800, which is still expensive. We wanted a gps but no one told us that It was gonna be almost 200 dollars more! Which is ridiculously expensive so we paid 900... almost a grand for only a week. If we knew they were going to charge extra we wouldn't have gotten a gps.< /Text>

When we went to pull out from a stop sign it would not move. The worst part is that when we told the agent when we turned in the car, her response was "oh, well we are pulling it off the lot to put up for sale anyway" CRAZY! Any rental place can get a bad car every now and then, but the way the company handle it when it was brought to their attention...that was the part that made me feel the most unsafe and upset.</review>< Name>

<Review>Save yourself from some pain,i rented a car for 2 days,slow lines at pick up,took an hour to get a car.the car i rented was supposed to be special and it ended up being the smallest car at the lot(they don't explain what special is so that you can book thinking you are getting a deal) when i returned the car i was okay with them charging my card to refill the tank, but they din't tell me that they charge 9 DOLLARS for a gallon of gas,They said that it was in the contract i signed.Who reads an entire paper while you are booking a car?SO they ended charging my card 115 dollars for a tank of gas,again another move for them to take as much money  as they can  out of you .Finally the brown woman with curry hair at return location,as mean as they come,she was literally happy to charge my card and dint waste no time to .Just seemed bitter for no apparent reason,well dollar and thrifty rentals i hope that 115 will make a huge difference in your lives,i wish you know the people you take from what they go through to get that money.< /Review>< pictures>

Straight terrible. Dont rent out what you dont have. Been waiting for 40 minutes just for a car to come available!!! Went and asked what was going on and they gave me the generic answer of you're next and it will be a few more minutes. Clearly they dont know how to treat their paying customers. Very disappointed, wont ever rent from this company again.< /text>

Would give these guys a negative 5 if I could.  On line shows they are open 24 hrs.  My flight was delayed 3 hrs, landed at midnight only to find they closed at 1030pm.  Thanks for nothing Dollar!!!</text>

Mr. V< /user_name>
<text>I love Wilsons Leather products. I bought a classic biker leather jacket when I was in my early 20s, about 20 years ago. I recently went to the Wilsons at the Citadel and the quality of the leather jackets today is the same as it was back 20 years ago. Staff is friendly and helpful, as always. The selection of jackets in this store is larger than the other locations.

The sale discounts are always huge at Wilsons. You can walk in with an idea on your head and walk out with it. The wallet selection is big too. Personally, Wilsons had become my definitive solution for being leather products. From jackets to wallets, I will always check here first.

I highly suggest Wilsons if you have an idea in your head for a slick looking leather product. Give them a go first and go from there. Audio, they sell leather maintenance products for those of you that own real leather products.<//text><Rate>5</Rate>< GmapID>

<Text>Cydne and Kevin were very friendly, helpful and incredibly patient. I took photos and waited for my fashion designer friend to suggest what I should try on. They didn't rush me and were very helpful in every way possible. There were  a lot of laughs during my two visits. This is a solid store with a solid team.< /Text><date>1569975238688<//date>< pics>

The layout of the store is very simple to walk through.  I was able to find what I wanted but not the size.  The associate was helpful and tried to locate the size I needed.  When we couldn't find the right size he offered an alternative.... very helpful!</Text>

This definitely was not what I expected. Wilsons Leather definitely does not carry a variety of leather jackets and other fashion Goods. I remember years ago shopping and visiting Wilson's house of leather and suede. This is definitely not a leather store.< /Review>

People were very friendly. Tried selling me the pricier stuff I wasn't really interested in, but that's their job. Only leather jackets I could find in my size here. As a 5'5" 270 lb dude. Prices were alright. Definitely cheaper than most places, if the leather is truly authentic< /review>

Plumbing Pros reached out right away when I put out bids on Angi. Steve quoted fair price for the work that needed to be done. He replaced 4 aging shutoff valves for us. He called us when his crew was on the way. They showed up on time and cleaned up after the work was done. I wish every contractor treated customers this way. I would use Plumbing Pros again and I highly recommend them< /Text>

Amazing company. So professional and customer oriented.  Has been a true blessing.  Replaced my water heater with tankless, installed a new kitchen faucet and put in the gas line for a dryer.   I would not use anyone else!!  Thank you to Steve and his crew!  Nobody better! And did I mention affordable.  Quoted me a price and I was so appreciative when he advised me the cost would be LOWER, as I already had a recirculating line!  So honest.</Text>

<Review>Their company name says it all. They are professionals in every sense of the word. We needed some non-emergency plumbing repair work done that was too difficult for us to handle. We contacted 2 plumbers prior to selecting Plumbing Pros. The first one was ridiculously overpriced. The second never called back after we left a message. When we contacted Steve at Plumbing Pros, he was very professional and personable. He gave us an estimate over the phone and was willing to do the work that day. We decided to schedule the work a few days later and he was able to accommodate us. The day of the appointment they gave us a call, arrived early and completed the work much quicker than we expected. They made expert repairs but also made some improvements to the original plumbing. We feel we got more than our monies worth and highly recommend The Plumbing Pros.</Review><rating>5<//rating>< Date>

Steve took time to answer my questions, and then answer my husbands questions. He was out the next day and able to replace the leaking water heater the same day. I love working with an owner operator and his staff was great as well. Professional, friendly and fair priced and took time to explain everything I needed explained. They will be our first call for any plumbing needs.<//Text>< pics>

<text>The crew arrived promptly on time. They were courteous and professional in there work. They fixed 3 toilets and they are all now performing perfectly. They fixed a dripping kitchen faucet that had been annoying my wife. They also addressed a shower that had a minor leak situation and stopped the water loss as a result of there actions. They were very pleasant to deal with and finished in the time period they had set up. I will definitely use them again.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809b0e5bc468aba9:0xbb52dfb6897f6cc9</gmap_id></record>

The best.  The owner answered the phone and gave me an estimate and booked service for the next day.  They arrived on time and completed the work professionally.  They hung around for a while to monitor the connection and offered to return if anything went wrong.  The bill was exactly as quoted.  What more could you ask for?  We’ll be using The Plumbing Pros again!</text>

<text>The Plumbing Pros are completely trustworthy and reliable. They do incredible work and their pricing is very competitive. They are considerate and knowledgeable. I would never use anyone else. They could have easily charged me for things I didn’t need, but they took the honest route and did only work that needed to be done. In addition, he had the parts ready so I didn’t have to wait. They always respond immediately. I highly recommend them.</text><name>Melanie Azarcon<//name></record></dataset><record>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>The drain on my washing machine clogged up so I checked online and called a few places.  The other places wanted to charge me to send a guy out and would not give me a quote over the phone.  One finally relented on the charge to send the guy out but still would not give me a ball park estimate on the cost to repair.  So I called the Plumbing Pros.  The plumber himself answered the phone and seemed very knowledgeable and straight forward.  He gave me two estimates based on whether I had a way to bypass the p trap so he would not have to take the wall apart.  Turns out I did have a bypass opening and he charged me exactly what he said he would.  Along with this, he was very thorough and did a few things he did not need to do like secure the washing machine drain hose so that it would not pop out accidentally in the future.  He also checked his work twice to make sure things operated correctly.  I really like this guy and his assistant.  Family business works best I think.</Text><date>1607120759235<//date><Response>{'time': 1607127975211, 'text': 'Huge thanks for taking time to review us!

<review>They replaced a bathroom sink that was cracked.  As soon as the sink arrived, we called and they were able to come to install it within two days. They arrived when they said they would, wore masks, removed their shoes and cleaned up when they were done with the job.

Noticed water heater leaking profusely around 8 am and I knew it would need to be replaced.  Called four plumbing businesses and The Plumbing Pros responded quickly, (the other 3 didn't).  Had new water heater installed by 3 pm which exceeded my expectations. Everything was done well and professionally.<//text>

I was out of town and my water heater broke. It was pouring water all over my basement. They said they could come out that day and look at it and fix it the next day. When they came to look at it they said they would be able to replace it the same day. What a relief. They did great work and were very professional.<//text>

Replace bathtub down spout diverter. Owner/Operator, Mr. Steven Lee and his younger brother (Intern) were very professional and courteous. They quickly replaced the tub diverter which now looks and works as good as new! Yes, I will call for their service next time I am in need of plumbing repairs.<//Review>

Steve solved a "loud" flushing toilet and replaced garbage disposal.  He was schedule for one time, but called to say he would be a few minutes later and gave me an eta.
He appeared promptly, gave me an estimate on what he would be doing.  Did jobs quickly and neatly cleaned up after himself.
In these pandemic times which are dangerous for us all, Steve used a mask and took his shoes off, and washed his hands.  I definitely appreciated his showing of concern by taking responsible measures!
I definitely will plan to use him again and highly recommend him.</text>

I’ve used Steve a couple times now because he’s responsive, professional, and I completely trust him. Plumbing issues are never fun, but at least I know that Steve will fix my issue the first time and his pricing will be reasonable, up front, and without surprises. I highly recommend Steve and Bruce.< /text>

I am a realtor and we had a major plumbing leak take place a week before the close of escrow.  I called 8 plumbers to see who could fix it for the best price and fastest timeline.  Steve from The Plumbing Pros gave us the best estimate, with the best products and the best service.  I highly recommend The Plumbing Pros!  I will definitely be calling them for any future plumbing needs.  Thanks again Steve!</Review>

Plumbing Pros were a pleasure to work with!  Arrived early, completed the primary task, and explained to us why an additional task was not wise to pursue at this time saving us $200+.  Would call again.< /Text>

Steve was awesome. I called another plumber at first, paid him $200 bucks and nothing was fixed, he didn't know what was wrong. Still frustrated with my issue I tried the plumbing pro's. Steve came out quickly and identified the problem and fixed it in less than an hour.So happy I called the plumbing pro's for the same price that I paid the other plumber for fixing nothing.</Review>

Steve did an amazing job on our hot water heater replacement! From start to finish it was a relief to know I found a plumber I could trust to do it right and for an honest price.
Thanks Steve</Text>

Very happy with Steve and the job that he did for us (disconnected plumbing under sink and re-installed new sink w/disposal). He was prompt and professional in addition to having competitive pricing. I highly recommend him and I wouldn't hesitate to use his service again.< /Text>

Steve is a professional - he had the right tools and the knowledge for the repairs that were needed. He went above and beyond to install some of the items that I had purchased and was intending to do. I will gladly recommend Plumbing Pros to friends and neighbors</review>

<review>Went tanning here for the first time. Carla was amazing, she explained the beds to me, showed me how to work them, went over pricing. She was exceptional. I been tanning my whole life, so I know what a good bed is. I went in the 12min bed for $16 and it was very hot, but I don't feel like it gave me as much color as it should've. Normally, one tan would get me pretty dark. I am going to go back and try the regular bed for $11.60, it's 20mins. I'm not from California, where I'm from you can go in a high powered bed for 20mins for $15.  I feel like if that bed would've went for 20 I would've got a lot more color. I'll repost when I try the regular bed.< /review><time>1522125794868<//time><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2iyysdqR73-lALYTZYo_bbelT0rhJrHO__9Ud=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< rating>

Amazing. I enjoy the shrimp coconut rolls, the pork rolls (don't know the actual name), and my go to is the red curry with chicken and extra veggies. My kids enjoy the fried rice and the prawn noodles. Don't forget to order dessert because it's soooo good!   The coconut jelly dessert (don't know the actual name) was great! Pricing is reasonable for a family and the quality of food is great!!< /Review>

<user_id>111306227464415041869< /user_id><text>Food was excellent. We ordered Chicken Pad Thai and Yellow Curry. Food was fresh and hot when we picked it up. I really appreciate that they use chicken breast, I'm personally not a fan of dark meat. Portions were good size and allowed for leftovers. Will definitely come here again.<//text>< Date>

<text>This place is a gem! It is ALWAYS consistent and DELICIOUS. Seriously, the best Thai and Vietnamese food. There is nothing on this menu you won't love. Especially the green curry and steamed chicken salad. Takeout is just as good from this place and they do curbside for Covid!< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD0wz_ZjivQhuLMg680-Lgy7Q7OXG2Krfw7BEg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNB1FJP66DEhagzkPccaiMvN0EXv6eUumhgm-J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFFi58kuFPV9MF2qYev9XqzcPy580_xZ13kl7w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnM8pB_GEOa0_DXtGw8KMKcz0guFEU_b3z5Klb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLt5oLDviTqG0emed-iPnfgjiar2giUhJJVIkK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM04rfXkcFluRLFG_kJx7HzUBQDwlXgPiSg30mI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMleKjYOOORqc1iRnq1jCPtY31ZtXvuD7qBknoj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFduu8EvoxvEztmErMIesO84jY5CfVdUiWzbL8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrLOEZjaArAV8t9_vdPTTx2HGzROWXxJ1nbR5I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>1.5 HOUR wait for online order. I ordered through their website, it did not mention a wait time, I called multiple times (they would not answer the phone). I received an email 30 minutes after ordering saying the order would be ready in an hour (total 1.5 hours). We are locals and have dined here many time, but Will NEVER return. An hour wait may be understandable, but it needs to be disclosed upfront, not 30 minutes after ordering, plus, I cannot call them to cancel my order. We are now scrambling to find something for dinner. I am so disappointed.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Do not order through delivery service. Go there in person only. They advertise 30 minutes, and I’m about ten minutes away from receiving my order I placed at 5:10pm.

It is a disservice to advertise incorrect delivery times. It hurts businesses who honestly post their delivery times.

I didn’t ask for a refund, I asked that the restaurant start being honest so we level the playing field for other establishments who can  handle the capacity.

Order was the beef noodle soup (good), side of vermicelli noodles and vegetable fried rice.< /text>

Any orders placed via Postmates the order has to be placed and paid for by the driver and WAIT which adds an incredible amount of time to the order which they don’t get paid for plus the staff there is incredibly rude. Just get in the car and go get it yourself if you don’t want to wait 2 hours</Review>

<rate>3</rate><Text>I was really happy when I found out that the restaurant would be open near our house. This restaurant is related to Brodard Chateau which we love to introduce to our friends. However, we are disappointed that the food here is not as good as the one in Brodard Chateau even though they have the same menu. I ordered a vemicelli with BBQ pork and it came out not as fresh and the meat was really salty and chewy. My husband ordered his favorite Clay pot rice and it turned out bad too. As a Vietnamese, I can tell that the food here is not something to crave for. If you want to have better food quality, I'd recommend the original Garden Grove branch.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Moderately priced but hey Corona Del Mar leases I'm sure. Still prices were very reasonable. Had a friend that did deliveries locally and she noticed this location was popular. We went to have a slightly later lunch there for fun. Wow! Were we pleasantly surprised. This is Viet Cafe/Grill style, not a Pho house. Although they have some Pho style soup selections. For a later lunch around 2pm they had 80/90% covers filled so busy place for sit down service. Still the turn over for wait was very short. My friend had a lovely Thai Iced Tea, I had a house lager beer. We started with a simple beef satay. Nice marinade and the peanut sauce was delightful. Was pleased it wasn't chewy or over cooked. They had shrimp spring roll variety and crab (?) egg roll (?) also. The specials looked very tasty too, I recommend checking them. For entre, she had chicken/shrimp pad thai, they let her combo the proteins. Flavors were spot on for the Pad Thai. I had their specialty Shaken Beef. I've had it once before in Garden Grove. Basically trimmed fillet mignon, done with garlic, mushrooms and bell peppers. Similar to a Chinese pepper beef Szechuan style. However, the meat is cubed and better quality for Shaken Beef. I'd say the sauce is more rich too, very beefy and tangy dark sauce. Portions were spot on. For service they were busy but helpful. No reservation, walk-in. I liked the darker ambiance inside (posted pics). The macaroons and champagne in the front case looked like a tasty desert for a fancy occasion. Interesting the his/hers restroom is outside and common to the business center. Just ask for the key at the front central desk. To find I suggest be northbound on PCH, hard right turn just before the Chevron and before Mac Arthur. Restaurant is ahead on the corner on the right. Some street parking or more parking after a right turn in the neighborhood. Typical parking for the area is a bit tight, plan for a possible short walk. Don't park at Chevron, possible tow. Done with Thai food? Now go south on PCH, right at Goldenrod and follow to the beach for a pleasing sunset at the lookout. Ah, the charm of the crown of the sea. Good appetite fellow foodies :D<//text>< Pics>

Great experience.  I've been meaning to go here for years and finally did. Great service, ambience and food.  Everything was delicious. Easy parking. Nice menu. We had the coconut shrimp rolls to start and then the garlic chicken noodles and beef with green beans. So delicious!</review>

This restaurant is my preferred one. I go to many restaurants but to this place I go the most. The crew is very cordial and the food they serve is so appetizing. I never decline to have a good dinner in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.</review>

I've never had Malaysian food and tried the beef rending and it was absolutely incredible. Eating here gives you a comforting home vibe. Come here to lunch, dinner, or take out!<//text>< user_name>

The customer service here is worse than at popeyes when they ran out of chicken sandwiches.  The food is good but extremely overpriced for a horrible wait staff and hostess experience. Not to mention how loud it gets in here.<//Review>

Local 'hidden gem' go-to for good Pho. Casual family dinner or date spot. Solid Vietnamese and Thai dishes. Fresh and simple ingredients. Food for the healthy minded, but also plenty of savory options for the non diet restricted.

Pros: food

Cons: service can be hit or miss.

Pro tip: for some extra spice... make sure you have the chilli sauce jar (small wood jar, little spoon, with clear top) brought to your table if one isn't there already.</Text>

We stopped here during the week for a quick lunch They had us in and out and well under an hour we had plenty of time to get back to the office.  There food whether you order out and have it delivered or go to the restaurant It's absolutely fantastic.  to be honest I can't pick a favorite item off of their menu It's all delicious.<//Review>

<text>I don’t understand all these great reviews here. Maybe we were just extremely unlucky, but our experience was not even a mediocre one. We got placed on the 2nd floor, unfortunately next to very loud groups that had no filter. However, we had chicken dumplings that were presented very poorly and didn’t taste at all. My main dish - garlic noodles with beef - was most likely the worst Asian dish that I ever had (besides a chicken soup in Macao...). Arrangement bad, no taste, the whole thing looked like Spaghetti tossed in Thai curry sauce and tons of mushrooms and asparagus mixed in it. My wife’s wonton soup was fishy and not tasty as well. The waitress that took the order never showed up again, and we had to ask for the check at the end, and the plates etc were never cleared. Not to mention that anybody had asked how we had liked our meal. overall, I cannot recommend this place I am afraid.</text>< pics>

<Text>This restaurant seems to be both a Thai restaurant and a Vietnamese restaurant, and excels at neither. I had the seafood fried rice, which was bland, and the others in my party had the green chicken curry, which was underwhelming. I enjoyed the tea boba.< /Text><date>1579113253268<//date></record>

<text>I really do enjoy this location. It's east to just hop off the PCH and get dinner to go, or to sit out on their patio on a nice day and appreciate the day while you enjoy your meal. Their menu is fantastic and they are a friendly staff with great service. I recommend eating here whether your by yourself, on a date, or taking your family to dinner. The menu is accommodating to everyone.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmap_id>

The Phuket noodle soup is the most mouth watering and flavorful seafood dish I have ever tried in my life.  Every time I come here, that is what I get.  There is no seafood soup as tantalizing as this.  The positives are that there is extensive parking in the street and around the restaurant, and this serves an amazing pan-Asian food.

The other negative is that the restroom is outside of the restaurant.  You actually have to walk around to get to it on the outside.  Also, unless you get reservations at night, you have to wait.  All in all, this is a fabulous gem of a place to dine out.  The prices may be a little higher than usual for Asian cuisines, but we are talking about Corona Del Mar in the nicest part of Newport Beach.<//review>

<review>Tasty. We had to wait a while even though we had a reservation, but the food was good and the service was good. It is too packed in with tables just like most of Southern California, but we will go again.

<text>Excellent Thai/Vietnamese cuisine! Fried rices are outstanding, noodle dishes as well. Their crispy spring rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf are amazing. The Tom Kha (coconut) soup is very good. This is the first thing I have at Thai places, it usually gives a good idea of the quality. My recent favourite that I go back for every week is on the special of the month menu (3 months in a row luckily!), shrimp, crab and asparagus stir fried with egg. I am addicted to it! The place is small, I'm surprised they haven't tried moving into a bigger space, they are always full and very popular for take out.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dce0f4bc7b1e1d:0xf628b21f583cec7f< /gmapID></record>

Stopped here while in the area for some dinner. We were promptly seated even at around 6pm on a Friday. The restaurant was fairly crowded though. Cost relative to the quality and quantity was good.</review>

Most Vietnamese restaurants I've visited are a little too strip mall for me. I don't know why that is, but it detracts from the experience for me. Not Bamboo Bistro...nice location and, much more to the point, great food. The Phu and Pad Thai in particular. High marks are well deserved.<//Text>

Great food :) definitely a restaurant that I will keep going back to. 👍👍👍 the only little drawback is that the restroom is outside down the sidewalk up in an ally on your right side. Needs a key to get there. Otherwise the restaurant is fantastic and always full.<//text>

<text>Great spot for lunch! Although it's also open for dinner, they're lunch specials make it a bargain. It can be pricier for lunch. Their soups and rolls are the best! Avoid 12-1pm as that's the most crowded because of the employees who work in the area on their lunch break.< /text>< Pics>

The best and most likely the only Vietnamese restaurant in Newport. The ground beef, chicken, and seafood egg rolls are a must try.

Parking is in the back. Few seating in restaurant. Restroom is a pain to get to and located outside.<//text>

Super quick service and rather expansive/diverse menu, but the rapidity of service was reflected in the details of some of their platings and the way some dishes were seasoned.</Text>

Where do I start? I love this place. The food. The food is so good. Thai is my favorite food. This place is Vietnamese and Thai. They have pho and all the Thai classics. The Vietnamese egg rolls are bomb. The pho is bomb. Pad Thai is great. And it's so cheap!< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Best Thai place in Newport Beach. The restaurant can probably seat around 50 but it does get quite crowded. The food is very good and service is prompt after you get seated. The curry with rice, pad thai, pad see ew, and pho are pretty good. I recommend the red curry with brown rice, very very good. Parking is street only so it's a bit tricky, but go to the back neighborhood and you'll find something.< /text>< Pics>

I’ve had lunch here several times and done take out and have found it to be pretty consistent. My favorite is their vermicelli noodles with the BBQ pork and eggroll. I’ve found it to be reasonably priced, especially for the area. We’ve also ordered the spring rolls, not sure how they compare to Brodard’s since I haven’t been there yet. The only down side is that parking can be a hassle.</Text>

<Text>I've been here a few times but on my last experience I had to wait about 30 minutes for a table after calling in and then telling me you'd only be 5 minutes. I then ordered food with my date and then they took another two hours to serve me. The food was all right of course but I felt extremely neglected and almost felt as if is staff was talking poorly about me on top of the bad service.< /Text><time>1481298637022<//time>< username>

<Date>1482605214533</Date><user>113994550675585396020< /user><Review>I won't lie to you guys. We went on a miniature adventure trying to locate this wonderful place. Can't decide if it's because we are special, or because this place is in such a tactical location that not even the hide and seek world champ of 2027 could find it. Anyways enough of that. Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns. Woops. Those are lyrics to Mulan. Sorry.

Seriously though. This place is delicious and I would highly recommend it to any noodle loving food connoisseur. Upon arriving at this little eatery on the corner, directly across from a conveniently located gas station for all your late night needs, we were greeted by friendly staff eager to serve their customers. Not even thirty seconds had passed and we were already being asked where we would like to sit and being directed to a table. Before you could even get comfy in your chairs we were already being asked what we would like to drink, not that this is a bad thing because I'm a thirsty guy. But wait, there's more. "Would you like ice with your waters?"  You're damn right I'd love to put frozen water in my liquid water to make it a bit colder on an already cold and rainy night.

I had never been asked before if I would like ice in my water. Most restaurants assume it's something you want, but I was very pleased that they would even ask. Definitely brownie points. A little later into visit, after starting at their mouth watering menu for a solid twenty minutes me and my companion, who is very cute by the way, ordered the Chicken Pad Thai for herself and I ordered the Beef Pho Bowl, or Pho Bo for short. The wait wasn't too bad, about 10 minutes. Plus I'm a firm believer in hunger is the best seasoning. When the food came out and arrived at our table, I took one whiff of my dish and immediately went to a noodley heaven. I transcended through noodle space and time and found myself in a bathhouse. Except the water was not water. It was a rich and tasty beef broth that was capable of bringing even the toughest man to his knees, and a tear to his eye. Not unlike cherry pie by Warrant.

I felt like I was in a 5 gum commercial. Every seasoning was so pronounced. I could literally taste each flavor dancing on my tongue. At one point there was the macareina, and halfway through the bowl they changed it up and we're doing the tango. All while this was going on, I was slowly being wrapped up in a noodle blanket covering me from head to toe. I could die a happy man. The warm noodles radiating heat throughout my body. I could do the Polar Plunge naked up in Big Bear and not even flinch at the sheering icy winds or freezing water. Which I actually did earlier last week. My feet almost fell off it was so cold. But not today, because I was protected by a coat of hot noodles.

The Chicken Pad Thai was also very delicious. I had a couple of bites. Unfortunately not enough to transcend noodle space and time once more, but I would highly recommend the dish. Enough so that on a second visit it would be a strong contender for my next dish.

We also had the Singha beer which was surprisingly good. It was a lighter beer with a nice aftertaste. Complimented our dishes quite well. We originally wanted the Lucky Buddha, but unfortunately it was out. Guess I'm not getting lucky tonight :/

A brief description of the interior now. Picture this, you're on a train going through the desert. Nothing but sand for miles and miles in every direction as far as the eye can see, which largely depends on your sight. You may need contacts. Anyways that desert scene is exactly what this place isn't. This joint is very quaint and cozy, in the best way possible. If I had to guess you could have about 40 people eating here max. But it works perfectly. Bamboo accent all around the walls, nice wooded flooring and tables. Felt like home. If home was a delicious Vietnamese Fine Dining establishment. Anyways I would highly recommend this place. It would have got a 5/5 stars but the bathrooms are a mission to find.<//Review>< resp>

Just over a week ago, my now husband and I hosted a wedding rehearsal and welcome dinner in Bamboo Bistro's private dining room upstairs from the main restaurant for about 50 guests. The owner Chau and her team worked so hard to make sure that all the guests were attended to and felt welcome, and ensured that there was WAY more food to go around. :) (my parents and relatives happily took what seemed like endless leftovers back to the hotel for the next day's breakfast and lunch). We're so grateful that we found this restaurant; everyone kept talking about how amazing the food, service, ambience and space was, and the quality of the wine. I can't even count how many people raved about the food and how fresh and tasty it was; we even had some people who had never tasted Vietnamese food come, but quickly became converts! We had many guests come from overseas, and now that they are back home, they still can't stop raving about the welcome dinner here!!

We knew we wanted something Vietnamese for our welcome dinner since there would be no Vietnamese food unfortunately at our wedding reception the day after, and we wanted it to be within 30 min. driving distance of San Clemente, where our wedding was. Westminster and Garden Grove, where most of the great Vietnamese restaurants are, would be way too far away, and we just happened to come across this place since it's a sister restaurant of Brodard Chateau.

The restaurant offers a number of multi-course banquet style menus, and all are incredible value for both the quantity and quality of the food. In fact, I think we chose the second cheapest option, but you'd never guess this based on the variety of dishes and proteins and how good the food was! The most popular dishes by far that were served were the seafood claypot, the shaking beef with garlic noodles, and the mango sticky rice. The tastes are authentic but with modern twists, which even pleased my Vietnamese mother, who is extremely skeptical of anything that is "modern" and not exactly like what she grew up eating in Vietnam. Setting up the private dinner arrangements and a few customizations was so smooth and seamless; Chau was quick to respond via email and incredibly apologetic (unnecessarily so) when she responded even just a day or two later).

The private dining room space is really beautiful - modern, but with lots of traditional Vietnamese touches and paintings/decorations. It felt so comfortable, cozy, and refined without trying too hard. It's like a bigger version of the main restaurant downstairs.

The service was super attentive and someone was always quick to come to my side whenever I needed even the slightest thing. I am really in love with Bamboo Bistro, the owner Chau, their menu and entire staff, and my husband and I are so grateful to have found them and had our welcome dinner there. When we are back in the area, we'd happily come back to eat here again and would recommend it without reservation for any meal or private dinner party.< /text>

<Name>Real Estate by JC< /Name><Review>Worse place to order To-go!! Called in place my order and was told 30-45 min, arrived to the store within the time frame, and the I was told it will take another 30 minutes because they were busy, employees were very rude and did not seem to care, not coming back for sure.

Ps.- they advertise themselves as a Vietnamese restaurant, but while I was waiting everyone seemed to like more the Thai side....</Review>< response>

(Translated by Google) Really delicious house
Noodles are delicious, steak salad, fresh vegetables and meat sauce
Best restaurant I've been to in a few days
Service managed
I need to come back

(Original)
정말 맛있는집
국수도 맛있고 스테이크 샐러드도 야채가 신선하고 고기양념도 잘 어우러진 최고의 맛
요 몇일사이 다녀본 맛집중 최고
서비스는 그럭저럭
다시 와야겠다< /text>

Newly renovated Starbucks in Safeway.  Nice, efficient and friendly baristas.  Very clean place.  They have special deals on certain Fridays.  I think it is called Friday Love.  For $5, you can get any Grande drink and pastry. For $6, you can get any Venti drink and pastry.<//review>

All the doctors & staff were great.  You can easily get appointments and they are so timely and attentive.  I definitely recommend.  In fact my husband is switching over to Smile Connection as well.< /review>

Been a patient here for a couple of years and I absolutely love the care they give me. My 5 year old was a bit nervous but they made him feel better and at ease. I highly recommend this dentist.</Review>

Very skilled both the dentist and the oral surgeon, I didn’t get a chance to get their names but they were both of Asian background. This office was very helpful with a stressful situation I was going through and they helped me not feel nervous or scared being put to sleep.<//text>

< Review>
I was in a motorcycle accident with blunt trauma to my face and mouth, I've been trying to get my teeth fixed ever since the accident and during a search with my insurance I came across Smile Connection. Trust me when I say they're looking out for your best interest and are overall great and patient people and I highly recommend Smile connection to everyone in the San Bernardino County area!

As I walked in for my first consultation I was treated kindly by the staff and felt very welcomed! After Dr. Peter and his team were able to assess the amount of work to be done on my teeth and its severity, they were able to start doing work that very same day! Just with what they've done so far I am happy to be able to smile again! As for pricing, Dr. Peter and I were able to work out the best plan that works for me and I could be any happier with the price and the work to be done! I didn't feel pressured or duped in any way, therefore I am pleased to say I am confident that they will do an amazing job within the upcoming weeks to bring my smile back and better than it was originally!</Review>

< Review>
Best dental office I’ve been to by far!!! The front desk receptionists were very welcoming and informative. I was in so much pain with my wisdom tooth, and they were able to extract it the same day after calling multiple offices. The doctor was also very informative with plans needed on my teeth. Thank you so much for all your guys help!!!<//Review>

I ❤ this place!! I usually have a lot of anxiety when I comes to going to the dentist, but everyone from the staff to the dentist is so nice! They take the time to actually listen to you and explain things which is great since I always like to ask questions :) it's worth the drive< /Review>

I have been shopping for the right and trustworthy dental within Inland and I am glad to find Smile Connection with Doctor Benson and Peter.  Both my husband and I have been coming here since the clinic opened.  The clinic is nice and clean with helpful staff.  Doctor Benson is extremely friendly and meticulous. Professional doctors and staff.  Thank you!< /Review>< Resp>

I'm really really sad to write this.

Initially, my experience with Smile connection was fantastic. I love the team (and still do) truly amazing people.

Here's my issue and please don't take this lightly. About 7 months after I got 5 root canals, one of them had to be re-treated. I was referred by Dr.Chen directly to another dentist who specializes in Endodontics. Wound up having to get the tooth removed fully by a surgeon who works with Dr.Chen frequently.

The surgeon AND Endodontics both stated that the crown for the root canal wasn't done properly and wasn't sitting on the existing tooth correctly causing the tooth to basically soak in bacteria through the gap between the root-canaled tooth and the crown.

Guess what...

1 year later, and ANOTHER tooth that Dr.Chen did now has to be re-treated and I can literally put a tool UNDER the crown and clearly it's not sitting correctly like the other ones. Now i have to spend more time and money trying to fix something that should have been done correctly in the first place by a doctor.

The only two people in that office that actually care about patients are Connie and Catherine. Both are literally the only reason I stayed there as long as I did. They both deserve way better.

I put 100% trust into Dr.Chen, Peters and the other female doctor (unsure of her name)  to perform all of these root canals with the best care, and clearly they all fell short of this. I will never go back to Smile connection because now I have not only lost all trust in their work, but have lost TEETH because of their sub-par work.</review>

I needed an implant and my other dentist sent me to an overpriced specialist so I went to Dr Benson for a quote. He assured me that the procedure need not cost that much and laid out a much more reasonable plan for me. He and Dr Peter are both really friendly and so are the staff and the procedure went as planned. I would definitely recommend Smile Connection to anyone!< /review>

<review>The staff are really great!  I was very satisfied with the work they did to my teeth. I can finally smile with confidence. I was so happy with them that I referred my sisters and mom.
My family also has a great experience.

Thank you so much for helping us and being one of the most honest dentist office I have ever been to.

10 stars for you guys!!< /review></record>

I had not been to a dentist in a very long time.  Today was one of the better experiences I have had at any dentist visit. The office is clean. The staff were friendly. And Peter, well Peter did a deep cleaning on my teeth himself. He numbed me up just right and I barely felt anything. He was super careful. Great experience and I'm glad I finally found a new dentist I can trust.</review>

1st off Im a 47 years old & scared to death of going to a Dentist. Needing major work on my grill & this place is an example of compassionate, understanding & empathy toward their patient's. From walking into this place & greeted with a smile & helpful info from Ms. Edith & all the way around from the office clerk, X-Ray Tech & Doctor. Explaining in detail, taking time to make sure Im good. Thank you guys so much & see you tomorrow!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) 7 stars recommendation. Good service, friendly staff and professional tech. They also provide Chinese service. Smile Connection is my strongly recommended dentist clinic. I have always been worried and entangled whether to remove wisdom teeth. After Dr. Benson’s consultation, I decided to follow the advice given by the doctor to pull 4 tablets at a time. Smile's doctor technology is really tough and superb. I took 4 tablets in 10 minutes. There was no serious physical discomfort after the operation, and the gums were red and swollen for 2-3 days. After that, the swelling disappeared and then healed slowly. Really thank you!
Will definitely continue to come here!

7 stars recommendation. Good service, friendly staff and professional tech . They also provide Chinese service. Smile Connection 是我强力推荐的牙医诊所.我之前一直很担心和纠结要不要拔智齿， 在Dr. Benson 医生会诊完后，我决定遵从医生给的建议一次性拔 4颗. Smile 的医生技术确实强硬和高超,10分钟就拔完4颗，术后也没有出现很严重的身体不适，牙龈就红肿了2 -3天，之后就消肿，然后就慢慢痊愈。真实太感谢!

<Review>As a child this spot was my favorite spot to eat, their food was always the best. It has been yrs. since i ate here. Today i went, my burger was definetly the way i remember it but my fries were stone cold they tasted as if they were still frozen. When i got home i had to recook them for me and my family to enjoy them. This is not the way they use to do their food.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80952f486d09a2cd:0xe98613b3067f324b< /GmapID></record>

Even though the line is long, the food is top notch.

No one goes there any more; it’s too busy.</Text>

Food is always so good and even with the long line the time goes by quickly. Only thing I wish is that they put lights in the alley area we are parked at. That feels a little sketchy.<//review>

Of course, in and out is the best burger joint with 3 combos and a hidden secret knock menu. This restaurant was good on customer service, our cashier was on her first day and did a great job with a $60 dollar order. Honestly though, I've never been a fan of in n out but I appreciate the hard work all the front line workers have committed themselves toward. Also, whataburger is still the better burgers.</review>

You have long lines but it goes through pretty fast. I like the window view as to see how food is prepared and hot. Courtesy with a smile. Need more "IN & OUT" Establishment.  Thank you</text>

Of course, in and out is the best burger joint with 3 combos and a hidden secret knock menu. This restaurant was good on customer service, our cashier was on her first day and did a great job with a $60 dollar order. Honestly though, I've never been a fan of in n out but I appreciate the hard work all the front line workers have committed themselves toward. Also, whataburger is still the better burgers.</text>

<review>In-N-Out Visalia: Same great burgers and shakes that can be found at any other In-N-Out franchise. Fries didn't taste as good though. Wait time was crazy: 20ish+ cars in the drive thru and 10+ people in line inside.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I've been going to In N Out resteraunts for 30 years. Always been my favorite.  Had my first disappointing experience today. Went through the drive through.  The burger was much smaller than usual and the patties were so thin they were non existant. The taste was not even close to what it once was.Whatever they decided to change in there food is going to affect them negatively.< /Review><Rating>2<//Rating>< Pics>

Has always been a great go too for classic burgers and fries etc for many years... however, the franchise should highly consider adding a second location near it's current one...the wait and the rapidly growing drive thru line is getting way out of control....< /review>

The drive through line is long to point of disbelief, and the reason is because the food is great.  Skip the long drive-through line, walk inside and get nearly immediate service. The inside is open and very rarely has a line now days.  The staff is always happy and always friendly.  In-N-Out kills it.  I've never had a bad experience in nearly 30 years of enjoying their fresh burgers and fries.  The only draw back is they have very few locations.<//Review>< pics>

In-N-Out Burger has never and will never be a disappointment in my opinion. Wait times can get a bit high at this location. However, the excellent customer service, cleanliness, and freshness of it's ingredients is a few reasons my family and I choose to give business to In-N-Out Burger in Visalia,CA. "That's what a hamburger's all about."</Text>

Through this pandemic, I've noticed the drive through lines getting longer and longer. IN-N-OUT has figured out a way to keep everyone fed, and in decent time too. You can go inside and order for takeout, or they have their patio open for sit down dining. For the drive through, there's an employee outside taking orders, so the wait time is cut in half! I was in line for no longer than 15 minutes! Thanks IN-N-OUT for being delicious and efficient!!</Review>

The Chick-Fil-A of the west but much, much better.  Expect similar lines -- that is to say, there's always a convoy at the drive-through.  If you can go when the lines are short it's a great experience.  I think they're some of the best 'fast food' type burgers around.</text>

Super crowded, not sure if there's ever a good time to go (not from cali) but despite the crowd they have a great system to make sure they're fast and take care of everyone. We didn't wait too long for our food. They were polite and friendly, great customer service. Fairly clean and Food was delicious, which is why it's always packed.< /review>

<user_name>Arin Sarris< /user_name><Text>Was a bittersweet CA visit this go around but made the most of a bad situation starting with some needed In-N-Out right off the get-go. Service was friendly and quality was on par (animal fries!) however they could use a bit of process improvement to streamline the drive-thru as the wait was a bit painful.</Text>< user>

Trying to pull in to any other business in this shopping center is made more difficult due to the blockage of the parking lot caused by the drivers in the drive through. The entrance from Walnut is blocked by customers of this restaurant for any other business in the shopping center from this entrance.<//text>

The best place to get hamburger in Visalia is In & Out. Yes, there is always a big line but it's worth it. The smell and the taste are so good. I love them you have to try them. They have some tables that you can sit and enjoy the beautiful day!<//review>

They know what they're doing! Food is always top quality and fresh! Service is always superb! Prices are always great! I have only one BIG complaint though! With them being so fantastic brings a lot of business. The problem is it's always a full house and we have to wait for someone to get up to be able to set down and people are always fighting for a table! The restaurant's need to be twice the size to handle the congestion! The one thing you can count on is that you can visit any In-N-Out Burger and expect the absolute best food and service which makes them #1 in my book!</Review></record></dataset><record>

We love going to In-N-Out Burger because their fries are gluten free since nothing else is cooked in the oil. Many places claim their product is gluten free but it isn't. The product might be flueten free but not the oil since they cook other products with gluten. How do I know, because I ask if only fries are cooked in their oil. By cooking it in a contaminated oil, the fries are not gluten free any more. To make the burger gluten free, I just order it protein style.< /Text>

Not gonna lie!! These guys need to step up there game big time!! Fries are soft an not crunchy like the ones in San Francisco!! Plus they always mess up our order an put items we specifically said not to. Would love to give them 5 stars but can't to be honest!!</text>

<review>This place is always packed. But despite that, I'm always given exceptions service and my order has (thus far) been accurate every single visit. I got here fairly often and even though there's a long line, the wait time is fast given how many people they help. Amazing food, kind speedy service, and accurate order. What more could you want?! 👍<//review>< Rating>

It's so huge it's almost impossible to get your mouth opened wide enough to take a bite. The crowd is a diverse crowd., always friendly and courteous. The prices are under $10 which includes hamburger, fries and a drink.<//text>< rate>

Fast got the order right ordered a big order for 8 people. Not a long line inside due to covid you have to have a face mask to enter. I don't recommend using the drive thru if your in a hurry drive thru line always blocks a lane of traffic an accident waiting to happen but other than that it's great.</review>

Disappointed. Walked in floors were sticky and black across the entire restaurant. Tables clearly had not been cleaned off. Received our meal and the grilled cheese (a cheeseburger minus the meat packed lettuce). When shown to a worker, she said it was in there. At this point, we were frustrated with the lack of cleanliness and In-n-Out is known for super clean and friendly restaurants, that it wasn't worth the energy...then she came over with a wrapper of lettuce correcting the error. We will try it again, but please clean the restaurant.< /text>

<review>The amount of customers through the place makes me wonder. Do that many people really think the food is That good? Or is it because it's a $1.50 cheaper than most other fast food. I give 3 stars for awe inspired wonder!</review></record></dataset><record>

Everyone loves this place that's why there's always a long line. But the line goes so fast. My grandson works there and he loves it. He's been there for a couple years and he's trying to move up into a management position. I am so proud of him. I had a hamburger and fries and it only came to $4 and some change. Now that's reasonable. And you know how good the food is.<//text>

<Text>What can I say? I work down the street and sometimes grab lunch here. I'm from Cali, but this is NOT the end all be all burger joint here. It is what it's supposed to be. Pretty good burger, fast service, and that's it. If this is your favorite place then good for you. But I have had, and will continue to have, better burgers. Again, I do like in n out, but it's not my all time favorite. I miss Fatburger.<//Text></record>
</dataset><record>
<text>What can I say crowded as ever that must mean it's got good food.   I will vouch for that damn good juicy burgers.  French fries are good. Iced tea is pretty good but the damn ice melts too fast<//text>< user_id>

Not what it use to be. Long wait for sub-par fast food. The Habit is far better in my opinion ; more bang for your buck there.</Review>

Worst In N Out I’ve ever been to. They’ve consistently got my order wrong for the past six months. My wife and I even emphasize how we want our burgers and all we get is attitude from the girls that work there. The only reason this In N Out is in business is because it has no competition. This In N Out would not have five stars if it were in Los Angeles. I’ve been eating at In N Out for over twenty-five years! I’ve  eaten at almost every In N Out from here to Texas and this one is definitely the worst one. I recommend paying the extra five dollars and going to the Habit Burger up the street.</text>

I'm a truck driver, and many restaurants have refused me walk up service during Covid 19. In n Out was gracious enough to allow me to order, and bring it out to me. Excellent food, and MAJIR PROPS to the crew in Visalia. You have ensured that I will return. Thank you much from a South Carolina trucker< /review>

Always fast and efficient. Food is usually accurate and we don't have issues getting our order wrong. The lines are always long because everyone knows where the good burgers are. Every employee here should be proud to work at the most popular joint in town. Can't get enough of their grilled onions, sweet and carmelized. Writing this is making me hungry, off to grab me burgers and fries!<//Text>

The line for the drive-thru is crazy long sometimes, I suggest that you go through the inside for quicker service. The place is pretty clean and they clean the tables constantly which is nice.

<review>The staff is always spot on. The burgers are consistent. But I have more fun at the DMV than standing around, waiting for food or getting tackled by tourist and crazed locals. I just wanna eat, man. This place needs a bigger building. Or close the lobby and force us to just eat in the parking lot.</review><Gmap_id>0x80952f486d09a2cd:0xe98613b3067f324b</Gmap_id><UserId.>105007400412800487360</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

I love in-n-out burger. I have a very sensitive digestive system, so fast food always makes me sick. Since in-n-out burger is all fresh ingredients, I can actually eat here without getting sick. Even though the menu options are small, there are a lot of options on the hidden menu. Just look it up online. Even though they are always really crowded, they work fast and wait is not too bad.</Review>

<Review>Most days they are absolutely great always have a long line but they improved on it by moving the line out of the way of traffic. They are always super fast for the length of line in the drive thru. Inside can be a pain as you have to wait to find a table or share with strangers but it's fine if you take it to go. The fries are always cut fresh in store and taste amazing.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I am addicted to this place. It smells wonderful on the outside and it tastes even better. Food is always fresh and the staff is always chatty and happy. Great place.
Only down side is how busy it is and the huge line of cars in the drive thru. This has become a bit dangerous to navigate. Please open a second location!<//review>

Food is good, the burgers especially. Price also very cheap. The lines are always very long, interior is a bit bland but i guess it is in style. The fries were not crispy. Their style is soggy, i didnt really like that.<//Review>

The food is always fresh.  No soggy lettuce or tomatoes ever. And the employees always have a smile on their face, no matter how busy they are. And they usually are busy, which shows that quality food and employees that are treated well really pays off.</Review>

It doesn't matter which location you go to...the customer service is always good and the food is great! Only con is that it's so popular there that you might experience a long wait, but that is changing soon because there are talks of a second location opening soon! Yes!<//text>

<review>It doesn't matter which location you go to...the customer service is always good and the food is great! Only con is that it's so popular there that you might experience a long wait, but that is changing soon because there are talks of a second location opening soon! Yes!</review><rate>5</rate></record>

The wait was really long, as always, but we didn't mind that too much. The staff was rather friendly. My issue comes with the food. The fries were pretty good. However, our burgers were not very good at all. I don't really know what's happened over the past few years but this place seems to have gone downhill quite a bit.</text>

< review>
So most of you know people literally wait forever to eat burgers here. I personally find the burger a 8/10, fries 6/10, and shakes 9/10. I don't like the how messy and dirty the place is. Everytime I go, I clean the tables myself as people don't know how to clean after themselves.  don't like how we can't find tables, and don't like the wait. I come here once in while only because of friends and family. I prefer they open a second location but I know that won't happen. if you have the time and patience go for it, but if in a hurry skip it.</review>

<Review>We, as a family eat at In-N-Out at least twice a week after bowling nights, I started eating at In-N-Out in the 70’s when I would visit my parents in Baldwin Park.

I like it, it's always busy. Even inside, but you get your food sooner it's just that you have to try and find a seat to eat. The burgers are ok.<//Text>

<Text>Best burgers West of the Mississippi in my opinion. Always fresh and fast with friendly efficient staff. Open very late on Fridays and Saturdays. Very clean, laid back atmosphere.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Charged me for someone else's order. Took ten minutes for two Double-Doubles, with no other cars in line. Took another five minutes to correct charges, and declined to offer anything for the inconvenience. Kinda disappointed in a quality organization.<//Review>< pics>

In-N-Out Burger is a must have if you like great burgers, it is one of the best experiences a person can make regards food for the masses. the food always tastes as expected,  you get what you want... you go to In N Out  and you enjoy the wait, because better food, takes more time...drink some soft drink, talk to someone and sure enough good food will come to you< /review>

I don't like or ever eat In-n-out burger, I get it for the family then I grab Burger King right next door. I have a relativele that sells. Meat to local burger joints in town, and with that knowledge of the places that buy the most interesting meat, I've made my choice of what burgers I'd never in my life eat again.</text>

Is it my imagination or are the burger patties smaller than no too long ago? Today's was small and dry. I thought; If I basically liked in-n-out could I just order the double to make up the difference? It is only a dollar more. Hmmmm. Let me think. Burger King. No Whatta Burger. No.Five guys. NO. From my own kitchen. Yes Same price. Huge 80/20 burger x2.<//text>

<review>Great place... great employees.... But the line that stretches all the way out into walnut ave. Every night that creates a traffic jam is not cool... Another location is greatly needed in visalia california.... Its not the ability of the people that work there that create the quagmire.. You can only serve customers so fast... You can't make things cook faster than they actually can... Get it together in-n-out people love your burgers... For good cause.. Food is great but the amount of customers overwhelm one location<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

What can I say about in and out. They are the best burgers there is! I don't know why they decided to add pickles after all these years of perfection. If it ain't broke don't fix it. No pickles!< /Text>

I’ve been to dozens of in and out across the state of California. In and out in Visalia was my least favorite. The staff was not nearly as friendly as everywhere else and their burgers were substandard when measuring to every other in and out.<//Review>

Best hamburgers in Visalia!! Cheap and very delicious!! Their animals style fries are the best. The only down fall would have to be the wait is very long drive through or dine in, you’ll have to wait a while. But it’s so worth the wait< /Review>

I give 3 stars since the service is prompt and the store is clean.  The food is not overly processed and is made fresh.   Obviously they're not a higher end restaurant.  But it's not going to be beaten by the other fast food joints.  If you're in a hurry I would not use the drive thru.<//Review>

It's In-N-Out. This location is always busy, crowded, long lines. However the streamlined approach to making the food creates a pretty short wait time. So don't despair when you see that long long line. It's worth it.
Tasty burgers. Consistent​ly yummy food.
I'd recommend ordering the fries "well" or "extra well" done, as they regularly are quite limp and anemic.</Review>

Hard to say anything bad about this place.
the food is always good, the service is always fast and friendly.
They really need another visalia location, it gets packed before and after lunch. There are about 15 cars in line and the parking lot is cramped. That tells you how great this place really is.< /text>

I wish they would fix the parking lot because it has gotten to the point that accidents are going to happen.
I would die for In N Out's food but the mess that the lines have become are making it not worth it. I've been coming to In N Out since I was a little kid and am in my 20s and this is the worst it has ever been.< /text>

<Review>This place is really good and they get you your order quickly. Disclaimer:this place is full and loud so if you are more of a quite person dont go here.

Its in-n-out of course its amazing. They always are quick but they do have a long line on account of the way theyre set up on the corner so it seems like more cars than normal but its worth it. They are always fresh and tastes amazing.< /text>

Yes, I had to try the In--Out Burger restraunt place while traveling. I do not like to eat at Mc D's type plastic fast food & mystery meats drive thu's. Don't hv in my part of country. My boys wanted try, so we did bc it was late & not much open.  We all saw lines wrapped around building & wondered WHY ? So we all tried burger meals,doubles for boys loaded with toppings. Being leary I tried a single
burger& fries.
I was pleasantly surprised the burger meals were  decent & hot. Toppings made the flavor..& burger Not meat quality!!
(I raise beef cattle side hussle -know quality & grades)
Very thin meat patties. I can see why most ppl were ordering doubles. Very
REASONABLY $ for a whole meal that includes a fountain drink. $6-$7.99
GOOD for a occasional meal, but would NOT EAT on regular basis.I don't really think it's that Heathly at all. It's a CHEAP meal & a FAD.< /Text>

Good burgers, good fries, and good service. Burgers never seem to be undercooked, fries are always done right, and the vegetables seem pretty fresh. The only thing that kinda sucks is the wait, but the food makes it worth it in the end.<//review>

<Text>The burgers are good. The fries leave a ton to be desired no matter how you get them. The place is almost always packed but they are usually quick to get your order out.  Definitely take advantage of the not so "secret menu".</Text>< pics>

<review>Parking and drive thru is insane. Burger buns are greasy got my order wrong twice the once part was that it was just one meal. They have their employees outside with no shade, no water, sweaty like crazy trying to get order through.

<Text>I am going to go ahead and give this In N Out 5 stars based on the food and the value. But I will say this... the place is always packed.... It’s impossible to find a table... If you want to sit with a group bigger than 4 - practically impossible.... The drive through is worse than the dining room... The line extends out into the main street half the time. So, there you go.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>Still very slow. Wait is too long!!!! They need to increase cooking capacity. They have a small flat top to cook burgers in. So they can only cook a small amount of burgers at a time vs the amount of customers coming in.</text><Gmap_id>0x80952f486d09a2cd:0xe98613b3067f324b< /Gmap_id><Rating>1</Rating>< resp>

Whenever I go here, I know I'll always be eating the freshest and best tasting Fast Food burger in town. The restaurant is always kept clean and tidy. If it weren't for long wait times to receive your food, then this review would've been a 5/5.< /text>

<Review>Plenty of food all around but sometimes it's just good to have a simple but great burger. The only thing I would change would be the fries, they're ok but just need more robust and filling, they actually get hard quick and taste more like cardboard. Other than that, great burger joint.<//Review>< pictures>

The food is good and the people are nice. It can take long to get your food as it's always busy, but it seems to be the only late night eatery in Visalia, so it's excusable.</Text>

Good burger, onions grilled as requested. Fries were mealy, dry inside, as though freezer burnt. Unpleasant.<//Review>

A true staple in California! Dont forget to look up the online "secret menu" as it has fan favorites such as the "Flying dutchman" or the healthier option of "protein style". Make sure to try some of their lemonade and of course grab a few spicy chilis on the way out. They are often located near the condiments or available through the drive through upon request.< /Text>

When very busy, this particular store seems to lose quality. If the line for the drive-thru is more than 5 cars, you might want to eat elsewhere. When slow, fantastic food!<//Review>

This place has delicious burgers. If you have not asked for animal style on your burger, yet, protein style for your burger (which means lettuce wrap instead of buns), or spread for your fries, then you are missing out. This is also a good place to dip their fries in their milkshake. It has a simple menu, and a secret menu online, so be sure to try some of these secret options. The lines can be long, reaching out towards the street. This means it will take 15-20 minutes to get through the line of cars before you are on your way out with your food. They are usually quite busier than any other fast food restaurnt around, but they move the line pretty fast compared to the others as well.</Text>

Can't go wrong with InOut! Had never been to the Visalia location and they didn't disappoint either. Was worried when I saw the huge Drive In queue but we were served quickly inside, can't see the point of sitting endlessly in your car when you can enjoy the atmosphere inside!<//review>

This a wonderful FAST-FOOD restaurant but there are always two manny people the dont salt the fries or the salt them to much the burgers are full a grease and there small so the wait is not evan worth it. I do not recommend In-N-Out if you have not gone don't go its better if you go to somewhere like McDonald's or jack in the box.< /Text>

My only complaint is that the wait times can get long and sometimes there's no place to sit and eat when you order in. Other than that the quality of the food is top notch. Same goes for customer service.< /review>

Fast service is key to a place like In-n-out and they hit this just right. My food was taken to me quickly and the service was great I would definitely say this is one of the better ones around the central valley.</review>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>As always, it’s In-N-Out! I love the food. The downside, and it is a BIG one, is the parking. It is horrible during peak times. I would highly recommend parking at Orchard and walking the short distance during and around lunch and dinner, otherwise you may struggle to get in or out. The drive thru often backs up onto Walnut so using the access at the far west end of the parking lot is always my strategy. Great food, terrible parking lot/drive-thru layout.< /Review></record>

< Review>
Well, I USED to tell everyone how wonderful the food was... But this time, my burger tasted dry, fries tasted old...I was disappointed to say the least. Perhaps it was just this in-n-out burger, I will probably never go to that place again.. But I will cont to go to in-N-out burger at a different location!! I haven't had any other bad experiences at other locations<//Review>

Fresh, NEVER frozen burgers, never frozen fries, yummy shakes and a simple menu. Drive thru is always fast and inside is always clean. Can get a little crowded at times but it's worth it. Try to find out about their secret menu!< /review>

Those lazy people complaining about the drive thru get out of your car and stop polluting. Expect the best quality correctly made every time. Best burger you can get dollar per dollar in America.if you want the best burger in the world get a triple triple protein animal style with added regular onions and a sauce on the side. It will melt in your mouth and you will be hooked like crack.<//review>

Very busy; most popular, nostalgic restaurant. Fast, friendly help, though often a line and some waiting time, but of course that is because very consistantly good food and drink; coffee is good too!< /text>

<text>A California staple how could I not give it 5 stars. I love this place but this particular location is usually very busy and the drive thru lines circle the parking lot. Its difficult to find a place to park on a Friday or Saturday evening.  If you manage to find a parking spot close to the restaurant be careful, because you could end up blocked in my other vehicles waiting for the drive thru. I suggest parking in the adjacent parking lot Orchard or other. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope they open a second location soon!</text>< pics>

Always a hit, they never make a mistake on your order and if they do they'll happily fix it. They only thing about this location is that there is a lot of panhandling in that area.<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Those lazy people complaining about the drive thru get out of your car and stop polluting. Expect the best quality correctly made every time. Best burger you can get dollar per dollar in America.if you want the best burger in the world get a triple triple protein animal style with added regular onions and a sauce on the side. It will melt in your mouth and you will be hooked like crack.<//Text>< pics>

For being always insanely busy, this place is never too long of a wait. Parking just may be tricky with the drive through line that is always wrapped around the lot and out to the main Street!< /Text>

< Review>
One of the Best Burgers, Fries, drinks.
Great Shakes and Everything is made as ordered. Beautiful cordial Staff.  Delicious food, open late and the has both family dining & drive thru. Takes a moment to get thru drive thru because the food is great.
Meal is made to order and much more. Right across from The Mall, on the corner of Mooney Boulevard and Walnut Avenue going West in Visalia, California.
"FAVOR"
(Christian Based and has Favor from Father most-high in the Heaven's over this establishment! Popular to all ages & Nationalities) Wish they would build one on North East location.<//Review>

<Text>Not good. Orderd  6 combos.only gave me four fries. When I went to ask for the other two they kept ignoring me. all and all after a 10 minute wait I decided I didn't need the other fries. Felt  ignored. After I threw the receipt on the counter and walked away. Then they brought me the fries. I sat there seeing them pack and give fries to every one els but me.. What ever. Never again. Plenty of other friendly hamburger places to eat.</Text>< name>

Nah! I keep visiting these places just to really find that amazing thing most people talk about but they are just very generic, there are way many better places to have a hamburger but here, 5 guys are way superior than here, I just don't get the hype! This location just made it to my black list! Not go!!<//Text>

Food is usually great.  Once in a while we'll get some bad fries (no salt or overcooked).
Always busy.  We could use another one here in Visalia.<//text>

They are open pretty late about 1:00am. There may be a long line, but the workers here move very quickly.<//review>

In-N-Out Burger is a unique place because they are not like Mcdonald's that have evetything come in boxes then put in the frezer. "Everything" would mean stuff like fries, the buns, the meat, etc. It's extraordinary delicious and cheap😍😍😌</text>

Burger is very good,  fries suck (some love them, but not me) shake seems very wierdly warm. And tastes like artificially flavored, but really its the ridiculously long line that i really hate. They try to make it go faster but 30 Minutes in a drive thru is ridiculous, i rarely find the foor worth the wait.< /text>

<review>Messed my order up. Waited wayyyy to long for nothing. They started serving people who ordered after us and ordered more than us. And they still managed to mess up my burger. I just wanted peppers added on it, nothing fancy or hard. Waited at least 15 mins for this.</review><user_name>Sarah</user_name><rate>2<//rate><Gmap_id>0x80952f486d09a2cd:0xe98613b3067f324b<//Gmap_id>< Time>

This In-N-Out never disappoints. I go here just about every time I'm in Visalia. I'm a big animal double-double and regular fries kind of guy. I highly recommend that combo if you haven't had In N Out before!</review>

I ordered a veggie burgar, I was so disappointed!! It only had letteus, and tomato!!! I guess that big cut of tomato was my veggie patty!! No onions, I guess onions are not vegtables. To top it off the frys were burned, you could also taste the burned oil! Was not happy.</Text>

<review>Our experience was great.  The man next to us was number 91 when our number 98 came up he wondered where he's was.  So he went to see. Two minutes later they came with his food and a big smile and apology.  They were very to him and give him a free coupon.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><date>1467838303937<//date>< UserId.>

They will put a burger together to your specifications with a smile! My son gets 4 by 4's. I get cheese sandwiches. BUT the main thing I like about the food is that the FRIES are fresh cut, cooked in vegetable oil and no meat products are cooked in their oil. Order your food Animal Style for a delete!

I had no idea what animal style meant and the guy at the till spent the time explaining it to me for which I was very grateful. Then I proceeded to eat what was in the top 5 burgers I've ever had and all for $4.<//Text>

Who doesnt love in and out? Everytime I go it always has alot of people, and its only obvious that its always packed because the quality of there fast food is great. By far In-N-Out is the best buger spot compared to other buger places hands down. They need to expand to other places to meet the demand.</text>

(Translated by Google) (Joh 10: 9) I am the door: if anyone enters through me, he will be saved, or he will come in and come out and be sentenced.
(In and out) I'll go in and get a hamburger

There are so many people at lunch.

(Translated by Google) The amburgers did not come out as I ordered them, I asked them with double onion, and they came out with some cooked onions, they are not hygienic in flavor, I was disappointed, they are my favorites.
