It’s not very often that one can say they love their local Cleaners, but I really do. Efficient, reasonably priced, and also includes alterations as an added benefit. Magic Touch’s owner goes above and beyond too - one time I brought in a shirt for a simple cleaning, she noticed a snag, and sewed it up for me free of charge. Last, pups love this spot too. Dog friendly and always treats on the counter!< /review>

I absolutely recommend this place for your leather purses. I unfortunately had physical sunscreen explode all over my expensive purse and was unable to get it off myself and my frantic googling had suggested it might be ruined for good. I'm so happy I found this place and brought my purse here to get it cleaned. They saved my purse and now it looks brand new!!<//Text>

<Review>I have been using Magic Touch Cleaners for my business and personal dry-cleaning for almost 8 years. All staff at Magic Touch including the owner Nazee always give great customer service when i pick-up and drop off. I have never once had an item lost by Magic Touch, as was the norm for my old dry-cleaners. The service is always quick and can be rushed when needed. Prices are very reasonable and I have found that they are better than most others in the area. As well as my dry-cleaning, I have had a handful of alterations done with Magic Touch. Each was quick, easy, and well executed. I would and do recommend Magic Touch to anyone who needs dry-cleaning, alterations, and fluff and fold. Although I don't take advantage of the delivery and pick up service at this time, I know they do regular stops at most downtown and local buildings.< /Review>< pics>

<user>100250866201415515724<//user><text>I've brought all my dry cleaning to Magic Touch for the past 4 years.  The primary reason I've gone there is convenience.  It's located right next door to where I live.  In general, my experience has been pretty decent.  It's a bit pricey, but they have a pretty quick turn around and are generally friendly.

I had an issue a few months back where they lost a shirt of mine.  That was frustrating, but they gave me a credit for the value of the shirt.

The situation that bothered me most, resulting in this one star review, occurred just recently.  I brought in a large bunch of shirts (20 or so).  When I got them back, I noticed that two of them (back to back in the bag) had stains that were in the shape of buttons next to the button holes the whole way down the shirts.  It looks like buttons were pressed against the shirt and melted a bit, leaving a glossy plastic residue (see photos).

I brought the shirts back in.  The owner said she'd try to fix them.  When I went back to pick them up, the owner explained that she wasn't able to get the stains out.  She denied responsibility for the damage stating that she doesn't have any equipment that could have caused those marks.  I told her that the shirts were fine when I dropped them off, but she insisted that she couldn't have caused that damage and suggested that I must have done something to them.

It's incredibly frustrating to be told that I'm to blame for this damage, when it's so obvious that they did something to them to cause this, especially since I've been a customer for years. I eventually told her I'd be taking my business elsewhere in the future.

I've tried to get the stains out on my own with no success.  Both are ruined and one of them was a custom shirt I got while in Thailand, so it's not easily replaceable.

My real issue is their complete denial of responsibility for ruining my clothes, then blaming me.</text>< Gmap_id>

I went there 30 minutes before close to drop off a bag of clothes for laundry. The lady didn't seem happy to see me with my bag but I brushed it off. She asked me if I wanted just laundery or clean and press and whatever, I told her just laundery and maybe a few pieces need pressing. She didn't seem to like that either and she told me I would have to pick up 6 days from now. I said "a whole week?" She said "yeah sorry but there are other places that you can go to."

So I walked out and I contimplated whether to leave a review or not but the impression I got is that they must have a great customer base and a certain type of clientele that she basically didn't care about a new repeated customer. I hope the people that run that place know what type of employees work for them. I for one, would not tolerate that type of behavior in my business.
Bottom line, this is referred to as, bad business.</review><Gmap_id>0x80d954ac49c1f61d:0x2950c531b0690616<//Gmap_id><Response>{'time': 1615575784717, 'text': 'Sorry Mustafa for the inconvenience but due to the pandemic for the safety of our customers and employees, we had to cut our hours and therefore we don’t have the next day service anymore.

If I could, I would give it 7 stars. I have been using Magic Touch Cleaners for 3 years now and they provide the best services. Both my partner and I use their services and we are very happy. We also got to meet the owner who is genuinely a very nice person and cares for her customers. They're very professional and have the best services. They also offer online and app services which offers free drop off and pick up services.
I absolutely highly recommend this place.< /review>

<text>A coworker recommended this place a while ago and I finally gave them a try. Glad I did! Great, timely service and the staff are all super nice! Price-wise, they aren't much more than others in the downtown area, and well worth it for the quality and service.< /text>< Pictures>

Been going here for years. While on rare occasion something may not be ready in time because extra cleaning may be necessary or a button will need to be removed before cleaning, etc. - they are very helpful and communicative and always keep me posted. Very good quality work and Eco-Friendly as well (big deal for me and my wife). Friendly staff. Highly recommend.</text>

< review>
My husband and I have used this service for many years.  We would deal with them not being very polite because it was convenience, but what we can no longer tolerate is them damaging our clothing and never making reparations!

We have had at least two very expensive items damaged beyond repair and they only want to direct blame back at the customer.  They even accused me of lying, when you can easily ask anyone who knows me and will get a consistent response that I try to always be most truthful.

It is really not so much the loss of money, but how they simply will not accept their responsibility and then accuse their own customers!  It is a sad world when the business can easily step all over their customer and they still manager to survive doing business!< /review>

The woman at the desk is extremely polite and her next day service was great for anyone that is in a pinch!

She was even willing to do next day service even though it was the weekend. Best of all she remembered my name.<//Text>

Sadly, I have used this service for many years, but it has come to a head, because they have ruined a second pair of pants without remorse!

When confronting the owner, she blames her customer rather than attempt to compensate for damaged items.

People usually entrust very expensive items to cleaners and it is very concerning when you cannot trust them...Just like Seinfeld's experience, they will not admit fault!</review>

They certainly do have the magic touch! (Too cheesy?) I am always impressed by their quality and level of customer service. They are always able to accomodate my quick turn-arounds. Magic Touch also does alterations (it's in the name) and that service is also FABULOUS.< /Text>

Unfortunately, for Magic Touch Cleaners, and me as a customer, this is a review of the horrible kind. I’ve had several instances with them where clothes weren’t cleaned and had to be redone, but this latest screw up is a major problem. I decided to share my specific experience with you so that you’re aware of how Magic Touch Cleaners doesn’t stand behind their work nor do they feel that customer satisfaction is important to their business…especially when they burn things.

About three weeks ago I dropped off the hood for my wife’s snowboarding jacket, which outlines the opening a thick SYNTHETIC FUR piece. The tag on the hood specifically reads “DRY CLEAN ONLY”. Four days later my wife picked it up, brought it home and was shocked to see the ENTIRE FUR PIECE WAS BURNED. THE WHOLE THING was burned at the edges and the fibers towards the middle were practically melted together. The thing was no longer fluffy as it should be but is now more like a big long thick cotton ball. Bottom line here is that it looks like THEY JUST THREW IT IN THE DRYER AT some point in the process and burned the freaken thing.

Naturally, I took the hood back to the shop in Little Italy, Downtown to see WTH happened and how they were going to make this right. My hope at this point was to get some sort of reimbursement/compensation to cover fixing/replacing the fur piece on the hood and be done with this ordeal. I was given the run around for a couple of more days with phone tag and what not, as apparently the only person who could resolve this was the “manager”, by the name of “Nassi”, which I suspect was the owner, but who knows. Once we finally spoke and she got to see the hood she CLAIMED FEROCIOUSLY that they followed the instructions on the tag (despite the evidence of the ruined hood) and she wasn’t sure what happened. Her way of making this right was to basically offer me some ridiculously low amount of money, that wouldn’t cover anything, AND TAKE THE HOOD AS SHE NEEDED PROOF TO SOME ASSOCIATION for compensating/reimbursing a customer…..My reaction “WHAT?!?!?! NO!!! That doesn’t work.!!” She said, “Unfortunately, that’s all I can offer you and I tried to work with you but you don’t accept.” And that was that….as of 3/16/17

Naturally, I’m furious and so is my wife for her ruined jacket. So I decided to share my experience with you so that you’re aware of how Magic Touch Cleaners doesn’t stand behind their work nor do they feel that customer satisfaction is important to their business.</Review><Date>1489891485268< /Date><Gmap_id>0x80d954ac49c1f61d:0x2950c531b0690616<//Gmap_id><username>Karim Dahdouh<//username>< rate>

< Review>
A very large product selection to choose from. The staff was very knowledgeable and quite helpful. I didn't get to meet Sean Boyd who had managed my order from the beginning, but he kept me well informed throughout the entire process. Upon pickup of my Marlin 6, Michael assisted and guided me through additional purchases to make my shopping experience complete. Overall, the people of Trek have won me over. I'm a Trek owner for life. This was well worth the drive from the O.C.<//Review>

< Review>
It is very easy to write a good review when everything goes smoothly, but quite another when things don't go according to plan.  It is very unusual these days for a company to make a mistake and then not only apologize, but do everything they can to fix it.  That is what makes Trek Westlake special.  I needed a wheel re-spoked and there were several delays that were out of their control.  They finally promised it on a certain day after several weeks of delays.  They are about an hour from my house and before I drove up there, I called to make sure.  Matt had guaranteed that it would be ready that day, but when I called it was not ready and would be another day.  I had hoped to ride over the memorial day weekend and due to work was not going to be able to go get it until after the weekend.  Without my asking, Matt offered to deliver it to my house the next day.  When I got home from work, there it was all fixed.  I have always used Trek Westlake because of the friendliness of their staff, but this was above and beyond.  It really shows the character of a company that they will make things right.  Although it is a little far from my house, count me as a very loyal customer.< /Review>

Amazing staff and customer service. Everyone there was extremely helpful and never complained. I am a newer rider to road biking and they explained the differences to me very well. Danny is very knowledgeable about the local rides and gave me quite a few routes for some of my first rides. I ordered a bike and it came in much earlier than expected! They were able to source out a bike that was expected to be months away from coming. The bike was built perfect and the services they offer after a bike purchase really make the customer service impeccable. Then, Jeremy, the sales manager, got the bike fit to me perfectly! No complaints with the shop and I am beyond impressed with the service they offer!< /Text>

Couldn't ask for a better rep to assist me. In fact, all the employees were super friendly and outgoing. I felt really welcomed. I reserved a mountain bike and when I got to the store, it was all clean and ready to go. The bike looked incredible. The store was also very organized, clean, and well stocked with inventory compared to other Trek stores that I've been to. Very happy with my experience. I highly recommend for anyone with any biking needs to go to the Trek Bicycle in Westlake Village. You won't regret it. After an experience like this, it's hard to go anywhere else. Definitely a Trek customer for life. Thank you again! 10-stars!< /review>< pics>

<Text>I love coming to this store. The people are knowledgeable, helpful, and patient. I must say, one of the best experiences I’ve had with them was over the phone. No matter how many questions I’ve posed to different employees over multiple phone calls, I always get patient answers in return.

Patience is indeed a virtue, and I’m glad that all Trek’s employees showcase this over the phone, where sometimes, it’s more important than in person.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80e824fcd467d273:0xf5aad94f5647834c</Gmap_id><user_name>adnanalibhai<//user_name>< Time>

Lucas is an exceptional member of the Trek team. Not only did he do an incredible job walking me through bike options while having a great time, he continues to remember me (under a mask even) every time I head into the store and see how I’ve been. Just by his demeanor and knack for customer success, Lucas’ presence on the Trek team is a big win for Trek. He will be an asset to any team he joins.<//Text>

<response>None</response><review>Jeremy Call was just great to work with!  I wanted to move up to a mid level road bike from the entry level Trek bike I had been using.  Jeremy was a wealth of information.  His enthusiasm, coupled with his personable nature and service oriented demeanor made the process enjoyable.  He also was gracious with my many followup calls and put together a package that was perfect for me.While all the folks at Westlake Trek are excellent, Jeremy was recommended by a friend and I could not be more pleased with the outcome.</review><user_name>Carl Deeley< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend. We had such a great experience purchasing our 2 electric bikes. Jeremy was so knowledgeable on the bikes. He spent so much time with us letting us test out each bike.

I had heard that because of COVID bikes were not available and back ordered. One of our bikes was available at the store and we had to order the other one. It was delivered and assembled within a week. We are beyond happy!<//Text>

Great group of people working here. I had been calling around to multiple bike shops to try to get my daughter a bike for the holidays. Nobody had bikes available anymore because of the pandemic, they’d become very popular and because of the pandemic too, supply was inconsistent. I was given ridiculous timelines and pricing for ordering by other vendors too. Trek Westlkake were able to get me exactly the right bike for my daughter, for the right price and in a reasonable time frame. I did the ordering all over the phone as well, didn’t need to go in person. The bike arrived when promised, was built free of charge and we were given two free tune ups to use once we break it in. The bike is ready to make one little girl very happy for the holidays! Thank you!</text>

Went in there this last weekend on the chance that they would have a part for an older BMX bike that I am restoring, and sure enough they did.  Paul could not have been nicer in helping me, and the whole experience was wonderful.  Going to be buying a new Mountain Bike soon and this is where I will be going, great selection at all different price points.< /Text>

Danny, Jeremy and Ed provided me with wonderful service on my purchase of a Trek Rail.  After 25 years of cycling, this was - by far and away - my most expensive bike purchase ever (and it wasn't even for me!).  The team at Trek Westlake were professional, helpful and, above all, patient.  They helped me track down the right bike, in the right size, in the preferred color, all within a very tight deadline in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.  They were beyond helpful.  The whole experience was without any intimidation or sales pushiness.  I wish buying other products was as comfortable and enjoyable as this.

Early on in my cycling journey, I was very brand loyal to Trek, but I have drifted from the brand recently.  I find myself heading back towards Trek, especially with such a wonderful and local shop.  I will be back!

Thank you Trek Westlake!</Text>

I purchased a new bike from Trek Bicycle Westlake Village and the whole team provided fantastic, personal service. The very helpful and knowledgeable staff lives & breathes bikes. The Service Manager (Dalton) built my bike with a level of detailed, caring, expertise, of which I have never experienced. I felt extremely secure knowing that my new bike was in his very capable hands. It is great to see someone take this level of pride in their work.
I now have a new home shop that I cannot recommend highly enough!<//review>

Best bike shop hands down, Danny and his team are super nice and on top of that, they will help and explain any questions that you have about anything from bikes to trails around town. During these tough unusual times with this virus, Danny was willing to meet at the shop to pick up some items which i thought was really cool, so even though they are closed, he’s willing to still meet you there and help you out. The bike shop itself feels like you walk in a high end Italian Ducati motorcycle dealer. Thank you Trek team keep up the great work 💪🏼.</Text>

I found the employees at the Westlake Village Store very helpful and appreciated the expert advice and lack of the "hard sell". The Store Manager, Jeremy, was especially helpful both pre and post purchase support for our EMTB's and we have been very happy with both the bikes and the service support.</Review>< pics>

Amazing customer service with Jeremy and Danny who were very knowledgeable about the bikes and accessories. Everyone was very helpful. Stock was limited due to COVID in all of the Southern California areas, but they had the one bike left in stock that I was looking for!  This saved months of waiting for the next shipment of bikes.< /text>

<Review>I think the survey took my earlier rating before I completed it but this is the real one, complete with my personal experience:

Jeremy C. and his team were all very excellent.  Every time I'm there, I'm always greeted with a warm welcome, one that is sincere and not at all robotic.  The first time I was there, I was in search for a bike, along with accessories to go with it, for daily commutes to and from my work.

I was helped immediately.  Jeremy fitted me with a similar bike I was looking for, gave me a test run, and picked out all the accessories I was looking for.  He even offered a cheaper alternative to the bike I was seeking, even though I was set on a specific bike I was planning on special ordering, which was very thoughtful of him.  After my bike had come in, he had already fitted it with the fenders I bought, so when I came to pick it up, I was all ready to go!

Great experience there!  Would definitely come back for all my biking needs!<//Review>< Name>

Just like everyone else, we got bored of being inside so decided to buy a couple Trek Powerfly 4s. Well turns out there's little to no inventory anywhere at the moment. So to find my GF's perfect PF4 in blue, we needed to drive from the Bay Area to SoCal to get the perfect one.

Many Trek locations won't hold bikes, and will not let you pay for it over the phone. Paying online is not an option in most cases.

This location was super helpful and agreed to hold the bike for about 5 days for us so we could pick it up on the weekend. AWESOME because other than Ventura, the next available units were in Utah.

Jeremy was super cool and helpful with her as she hasn't had a bike in a while. Very patient and knowledgeable. He also took a look at my bike that I'd purchased from Trek Livermore up North that I had some questions about.

Really a great experience and we are very appreciative of everything this store did!< /Review>

Excellent service, intelligence (bike mechanical know  how) and old school manners! Bought a new bike a week ago after having 30 year old bike rehabbed here. They know their stuff. Others could take lessons from these employees! Highly recommend and btw it is an excellent product.
Bought a bike rack from Dalton and Jeremy installed it! I feel like their service is from a byegone era. Great hires! Wish l could rate beyond a 5.<//review>

First off, Trek has great bikes which is why they get 2 stars and not zero. The sales here was a horrible experience. I spent over $900.00 on a bike. When I received it, it did not have the hand grips that was stated in the description. When I asked, I was told they didn't get them but the ones on it were better. They are not. It is supposed to have the ergonomic Bontrager XR Elite. Instead they are Bontrager XR Trail, which are less comfortable and $10.00 cheaper. Next, it had a universal mount on it but they didn't have the piece that mates to it for devices. When I returned a second time, I asked again about the mating piece saying a good number of their bikes in the store had this mount, but no mating part? After the employee asked the manager, one was found in a toolbox. AND I WAS CHARGED $7.00 for the part, that I should have already had. I asked these same questions at another bike store and they had both the hand grips and the universal mount, all pieces.

Update: I am reducing the star rating to one.
I emailed the manager one month ago per the response and have not received a reply. I visited the store for one last chance for a tire and tube issue but was told they didn't carry my tire and tried to sell me an undersized tube. No offer to order the correct ones. I visited Go Green Bicycles in Burbank who not only carried my tube and gave me a free adjustment to my bike I purchased at Westlake Trek, but also said they would honor my tire warranty if I chose to replace and order the correct one.

7-30-2020: Here is the original email to the address provided in the first response. I have not received a reply to it nor have I received a call or voicemail to my number on file.</Text>

The community of people who work at and frequent Trek continue to surprise and impress. Each time I go in it seems I find something else to compliment. For instance, over the past few months I have been fine tuning my road bike and on several occasions I was able to stop by and get detailed advice from the technicians. I really appreciate the support and comradery offered by the people at Trek.</Text>

I'm from Santa Barbara, CA and drove all the way to Westlake to purchase the bike that no dealer in my area had in stock. Their customer service and willingness to help has lead me back several times.
Recently, I planned a 70 mile E-bike ride. Needed a second bosch battery from a brick and mortar authorized dealer. Called dealers around my geographic location and was quoted a four to seven day wait time. I talked to Danny on a Monday mid-day and he had the battery for me on Wednesday mid-day. That's a two day wait time, NOT four or seven.  How come other dealers couldn't do the same for me?
Great place to purchase a bike. You get very good service after the sale and questions answered.<//text>

I got a great quality bike within my budget. So far, it rides very well and has met my recreational needs. What stands out is the service I received. As a entry level bike rider, I was really impressed with the time and patience that James had when explaining the difference in the bikes and breaking things down so I, a novice, could understand. He didn’t try to push me into buying a more expensive bike and when I said I would return after thinking about it, he didn’t pressure me to buy right away. In fact, he assured me that if the bike was sold, he would order me one. This was the third bike store I went to this weekend and the service was exceptional. I returned 10 minutes later and bought the bike. Excellent service should be recognized. Thanks, James!<//Review>

Outstanding service and help from Danny and his crew.  They went way above the norm to help me get my bike set up, help with my trade in, and ensure that I was happy with my new Cross Rip Electric bike.  It really is a beauty.  I just got back from a 50 mile ride, with 18% left in ECO mode.  It's comforting to know that in a month, Danny and crew will give it a tuneup, and then another in about a year.  These people treat you the way you want to be treated.  Without hesitation, I fully endorse and support this bicycle store.  One of the best stores, of any kind, I've ever been associated with.<//text>

<Review>World Class, Best in Class Bike (Rental) Experience!   Was in Westlake for the Weekend.   Called last minute inquiring about a rental.   They provided me with a state of the art bike with electronic shifting and full disc brakes.   Spent an additional 20 mins fine tuning my body geometry to the bike.   Upon my return, they were genuinely interested to hear about my ride and my thoughts regarding the bike.   Would highly recommend to all local riders and those traveling into town for the weekend.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1552514101667, 'text': "Thank you for the shout-out Edmund!

I enthusiastically offer up a 10 rating for the sales experience at Trek, Westlake Village. Attentive, knowledgeable staff willing to offer sales counsel and guidance and test rides to my grandson. Comforting to know I was dealing with a corporate store, and that training and break-in adjustments were included in the purchase. Both Courtney and Ed were great, and the offer to deliver the bike saved me from trying to wrestle it into my vehicle which was not yet equipped with a rack. This is our first purchase from the store and we are hopeful that in time we can also give a 10 rating on follow-up, service, and continuing support to biking customers and the biking community.<//Text>

<Text>Mostly it was your services that impressed me the most. I came in wanting to get started cycling from scratch, bought a bike, a kit, shoes, everything. The employees at the westlake location were super knowledgeable, walked me through every possible product that I might need, were attentive to what I wanted, were very friendly, and made the whole experience fun. I had almost as much fun in the store learning and buying products as I did riding the actual bike I bought. I bought the emonda alr 4 and absolutely love it. Every time I look at it I love it even more. I will absolutely make the trek westlake location my cycling store for everything I need and will defer friends to that store as well.

<Text>I needed some new hardware on my tribike, and while my bike is not a Trek, the shop guys went above and beyond.  I received my bike bake with new brake levers and pads properly installed, and they even cleaned up the bottom bracket and other areas that were getting kinda nasty with miles.    Dalton and Jeremy were very helpful and the mechanics do a bang-up job!< /Text>< pictures>

We recently travelled from Calgary, Alberta to Westlake for a long weekend of cycling in the beautiful Santa Monica Mountains. Sadly (initially) the threads on a seat post stripped when assembling our bikes so we were in a pickle. Happily, it was also the day the new Trek store opened and we were welcomed by the awesome staff. They provided a quick fix, being totally familiar with the problem and then spent loads of time helping us find the best routes for our 4 days of riding. THANKS team!< /Review>

This new Trek shop sure has a totally different feel than the shop that used to be in the same location back in the day.  Definitely the best bike shop in the area.  As far as I can tell, they carry the best bikes for all types of riding, and all levels of riders.  Plus, their staff actually rides (unlike a lot of shops) and they can fill you in on where to ride, how to use your equipment correctly, how to improve your skills, how to get stronger, or just show you how to have more fun on a bike (and that's what is most important).</Text>

Under the careful management of Danny Luphold, this shop is making a huge splash in our community.  Beyond promoting a healthy lifestyle, they are also making a considerable contribution to the lives of others who have been affected by recent tragedies.   What a fantastic example of what we need at the grass roots level in great retail!< /Review>

Trek is a great bike brand only made better by the store and staff at Trek westlake village. It was hands down the best sporting goods and bike shop experience I have had. From day one everyone at the store was energetic, professionally and helpful and helped me build my dream bike. I highly recommend Trek as a brand and this store especially for all your biking needs.</review>

< review>
Great store!

After being continually disappointed with Helen's MB and Westwood (where I had previously purchased two FX6 bikes,) I picked up the phone and called Trek Westlake.  This store's staff could not be more clear and accommodating.  I struck my deal and made the 'trek' to Westlake from the South Bay one Sunday morning. And guess what?  Once I arrived at the store to purchase my FX7, I was actually given an even better price than I had bargained for, with an additional $150 store credit to boot!

Don't get me wrong, these folks know what they are doing....I will certainly be back to buy more.  They have lots of floor space and quite an amazing inventory, especially of mountain bikes.</review>

What I like about the product I bout was that the person that helped me ensured that what I was getting was right for me. I myself was a bit nervous but in the end its worth it to know that you made a correct decision in purchasing the bike or accessory .< /text>

- It was therefore disconcerting to get two flats on the new wheel they installed (find out the rim plastic on the new rim didn't cover the spoke holes).
- The front tire also needed replacing, but they didn't notice.

It's also a bit weird to charge for replacing the tube when I bought Level 2 service anyway.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<text>I hate to give only 3 stars. The lady that helped me was very nice and helpful. However, the service was extremely slow. The phone was ringing off the hook, there were only two of us in line and it took quite awhile to get help. I was told HR calls randomly to access how they are doing as far as customer service and wait time. I get that but the phone becomes first priority leaving the ones who came in to wait. That poor girl was doing the job of 5.< /text></record>

Great experience today.  Always hear about their no hassle warranty, but never got a chance to experience it. Today I had to exchange a spark plug that was misfiring. Didn't have receipt, but I did purchase with my rewards card.  They just verified it then exchange it. Very easy would recommend to anyone and wv<//Text>

I was very unsatisfied with the kragen on dinuba blv in visalia.i ordered a part and it was  to arrive on a Wednesday at 7 a.m. I called at 3 p.m. they told me everything on that truck hasn't been put into the system if they can have my number and call me back when they find it. by 5 pm that same day I walked into the Kragen talk to the same assistant manager that told me quoting him  "so did they call you " wow i said No. he was the same assistant manager that helped me on Sunday to order the part and was very adamant that it would be on the truck  here on Wednesday.  He looked over to an employee and said did you get to look for that part I was very shocked as being an assistant manager talking to him twice knowing some of the parts weren't put into the system why when they arrive at 7 a.m. he decided to walk to the back check it out himself came back and told me my part was never on the truck he apologized to me but at this point I am very unsatisfied with his professionalism he is not consistent as a manager what kind manager shows his employee the inconsistent of helping a customer with a order part or any part let's just say.  so at this point I ask for my money back he did not in no way shape or form try to keep me from leaving he did not even try to make me happy knowing the frustration that I  had to order the part waited 3 days  didn't get a call Early in the Morning  that the mistake was made and they will reorder my part he let an unsatisfied customer walk out the door. I am very disappointed in this Kragen Auto I have worked for Kragen I have never treated a customer the way I got treated maybe it's because I'm a girl and I don't know anything right wrong color race or gender should not matter well that's my story and from now on I will be going to the sister stores Smith Auto Zone anything else but Kragen< /Text>

<text>What I liked most was how the staff here are so willing to help, whether it be advice or going under the hood for a look, they'll do what they can. And really, what more could you ask for?</text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) In that ring, parts are very bad because I already had the receipt for something I bought and I returned it because it did not go well and I still wanted

I had a idea for modifying the exhaust on my 2014 Rubicon but I was not sure how it would turn out. I walked in without an appointment and 20 minutes later my Jeep was up on the rack and they were already working on it.
I went with their suggestions for removing my muffler and adding a resonator.
I turned out better than I expected! Two hours later I drove out with a smile. They were very professional, did a great job and I am very pleased with the outcome.< /review>

Had catalytic converter, muffler and exhaust pipe replaced on 98 Jeep Wrangler. Quality of work was high. Marlon was very helpful in making suggestions for the exhaust system. I have since told two friends about WTB and they too were satisfied with the work done on their cars.</review>

<text>First time customer, called on the phone urgently needing some exhaust work. They were able to squeeze me in first thing in the morning the following day. I had raised my car and had issues with suspension components hitting the exhaust in multiple areas. They ended up having to re pipe the entirety of the exhaust from a couple feet in front of the differential to the back of the bumper. No more contact under full droop and compression! Really clean welds and craftsmanship, not to mention they had the car back to me in a couple hours and had no more issues. Highly recommended!< /text>< pictures>

Marlon was super awesome and explained everything they were going to do to my car (I did a muffler delete) and even went as far as to show me the new exhaust tips they were going to put on my car before they put it on. The price was fair and he answered all my questions honestly. I HIGHLY recommend this place. I will never go anywhere else in the future but here for exhaust work!< /text>

Marlon and his crew went the extra mile when the "bolt on" exhaust kit I bought for my truck had some fitment issues.  They want the extra mile, worked harder and longer and made the necessary modifications.  Did all of the above and did not charge additional labor!   Now that's a business that warrants new customers! They are my new muffler shop for all of my vehicles!<//text>

Had a broken exhaust pipe  at the muffler on my 99 Hyundai Elantra. I work on my car every once in a while and researched the fix for this  online. It required welding etc and therefore decided to outsource this.  Found this place thru google as it had 5 star reviewers. The owner ( Marlon) took a quick look and very much concurred with what I had researched  without adding any unnecessary and expensive  up sells. He quoted a reasonable price and   Finished the job in 30 minutes. Very happy with the overall experience. This place is honest, fair priced and quick. 5 stars from my side as well.< /Review>

This is the first time I met Marlon. He is a very nice person. I literally took my Civic with a hanging muffler. Honda Service center gave me an estimate for 3000 dollars for fixing the muffler. I brought it to this place. Told him I am planning to sell the vehicle soon and want this repaired so that it wont be too costly to me. He gave me two options 1. replacing the whole thing. The cost is no where near 3000 2. To fix it in a way that I can have it working for at least until my catalytic converter give up. He did a very decent job for 250. My car sounds like a new car with no sound at all. Very nice job. Totally satisfied with the way he did the job. He is a very nice person too. Definitely recommend this to anyone. I am glad I came to know about this shop.< /Review>

Needed a hole patched in my exhaust and a hanger fixed. Took care of it quickly, reinforced the hanger so it won't break as easily again. Great work, and very well priced. Will be coming back for future exhaust work and already referred a friend.<//review>

Dan is very helpful and knowledgeable in how he fixed the muffler on the BMW. Where I thought the fix would be a bit expensive, he kept it at a reasonable and fair rate and also completed it in a acceptable amount of time. He was very meticulous in what he did and I and my friend are very appreciative of his work.< /text>

I brought my car to WTB thinking it needed a new flex pipe in the exhaust system as I could see the old one was shredded and thought it was giving me an exhaust leak and throwing an engine code. WTB took a look and confirmed that the flex pipe was shredded, but not yet leaking and wasn't the cause of my code. In my years of car ownership I've caught two shops trying to cheat me with unneeded repairs. I reported them to the local inspector. It's only fair that when I run across an honest shop I make sure to report them to everyone else. WTB didn't work on my car because they were honest enough to tell me I didn't need it yet.

I walked in to see when they could fit me in to take a look at my truck. The guy at the shop said "how about now?" After an inspection, I was shown what was wrong with my truck. I was pleased I just had to replace the muffler, which just shows this shop will only make repairs necessary. They did a great job at a good price, and I was in and out as a walk-in in about an hour.</Review>

<Text>Operated by owner himself, A trustful go to place for Muffler problem,  the price is very attractive and the workmanship has quality,  my 2003 Toyota Corolla's Muffler pipe fall apart,  he soldered it for me for $50,  so far so good,  I did have one small problem with appointment -- Dropped by first time with appointment but told come back later,  but considering that it is one man operation and the price and quality of the work, no issue for me.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Walked in on a Saturday not expecting to get the actual work done, thinking I'd have to schedule something later in the week. They got me right in for a resonator delete on my Focus ST. Only 70 bucks and a half hour of my day! Friendly shop guys,  good price, and great work! Can't beat it!< /Text>

While in LA, my car hit a piece of metal debris on I-5.  It caused a nickel size hole in the exhaust pipe.  Ford wanted $735.00 for the entire system - only way they would replace the damage.  WTB was referred to me by another shop.  They said they'd do a great job for a super price.  BINGO!  So right they are.  I arrived at WTB Mufflers early Friday.  Dan heard my description, took the car to the rack, confirmed the problem, quoted a super price, and repaired it within 30 minutes.  Friendly, professional, super reasonable.  Thank you WTB Mufflers.</Text>

This place is awesome! Definitely recommend Marlon and the crew.  Worked me right in and I was out of there in 25 mins. They welded my exhaust of my mercedes AMG and fixed the bracket for a fraction of what another shop wanted. Trust me..call these guys. They are good peeps!<//Review>

<text>First off I am a 28 year old woman with little to no knowledge of cars...I recently took my 2014 Chevy Cruz to WTB Mufflers because of loud metal on metal grinding sound that was coming from the front right wheel well. I was astonished to find out I had warn the front right break down to negative nothing, damaging the rotor beyond repair. These guys took the time to explain how this was done, several options for repair and ultimately encourage me to contact my dealer to have the car, that is still under warranty, fixed by Chevy. I must have taken up at least 2 hours of their time and ultimately did not have the work completed by them but the knowledge I gained and the confidence to approach the dealer was priceless. Frank has been working on my mother's car for two years now and she refuses to see any one else as will I. Thank you Guys for your time and all the great advise. I will be back!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I picked WTB for muffler repair work on my car based on all the positive reviews I read online. And I had the same experience those others had - fast, friendly, affordable service. The repairman showed me the location of the problem and provided options with pricing for the repair. He also pointed out a flange that is ok for now but likely to need replacement "within the next two years" due to salt corrosion from my years living in the Midwest. And again offered the option / price for replacing it now or waiting until later. When they pulled the car around after the repair I didn't even hear it, it was so quiet - even though it sounded like a boat before. And they gave me a great price. It is SO great to find an honest, knowledgeable repair professional in any profession. I highly recommend WTB mufflers.<//Text>

<text>Needed some custom exhaust work on a vehicle with an engine conversion.  One shop on Poway road by the car dealers essentially told me to find my own parts and they'd install them.

This place called around, found parts, even ordered a few different sets to make sure they had the correct one to get my truck done quickly.  Good shop and a good place to take custom work where out-of-the-box thinking is required.<//text>< pics>

These guys know what they're doing. I had my wife's ST get a new 3 inch and my Camaro SS. Very happy with the installation quality as well as the speedy Ness of the job. They don't mess around here.

Update: I just got my project mustang exhaust done and man am I impressed with their work. 5 stars!</review>

<Text>Had my 2013 Dodge Charger SRT8 exhaust done here back in September, and all I could say is awesome job these guys did. The weld job was spot-on, and this is coming from me who grew welding learning from my grandfather. The super 44's and the reso delete sounds excellent. Will be coming back if I need anymore exhaust done to my cars.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>Great place to grab snacks and your regular junk food. Potato chips candy bars, sodas, fountain drinks and a pretty large veriety of hard liquor. Lotto scratch offs and always a friendly person behind register. Small store area kinda crowded but always stocked and clean. Perfect place if you are in a hurry or hate waiting in line.< /text><userid>112678900210323081164</userid>< Name>

Nothing fancy... But who needs it to be 🤣🤣 They are so fast and you don't even need to get out of the car! Be sure to get the coupon from their website before you go! It's a little pricier than some places but for convenience, to me it's totally worth it! No need for an apt and it's usually empty! They are also very nice every time I have been there.<//Text>

<Text>Expensive.  They find excuses to run the prices up on you like crazy. Its all legit, maybe i could use it maybe i couldn't,  nothing crazy. But you get the slime ball sense from them.  The guys are good,  know their job and work fast.  Very nice about cleaning you out.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Although on little pricier side, love their service. They are really quick, efficient and reliable. They recently made some changes on their service and you no longer have to get out your car while getting oil change. Love the concept of the drive-through oil change.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Bait and switch on price called 5 mins before arrival and quoted 15.00 less than actual charges....charged extra for standard oil filter.   Everyone else includes it...The worker actually put the wrong oil in my car...if I didnt spot it and make them change it...they would have sent me away with the wrong oil and possibly damaged my engine....workers mostly look and act like high school kids...not a good experience.< /review>< Pictures>

Pretty fast and quick service. Prices were very reasonable too. They also do four cars at a time so you are not waiting behind some other car needing to get serviced. They also added air to my tires free of charge. Thank you!< /review>

<Review>Very convenient place for me and staff are pretty nice. I don't know how to check if they are doing right so I can't provide detail about the quality of the inspection or something.  I waited in the line for 15minutes and get the oil change about 25minutes. I think the last available time is 645 pm because I was the last customer.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

Fast service no complaints!  They didn't try to sell me up a million add on services like other places, they saw I was in a rush and did their job quick.  They have a sale right now on new customers for basic service 9/2013< /review>

< Review>
I've been using them for the last 5 years, but the last 3 oil changes they didn't close my hood all the way. 2 different cars. The reason is because they are easily distracted while they chat amongst each other the whole time. Gave them too many chances, will not be going back.<//Review>

<review>This place is horrible. They will cheat you with easy fixes. If you don’t know anything about cars don’t ask them because they are just after your money. They are unfriendly, shady, and just unprofessional workers. The standards are low and have no ethical values. Oh and they yell at you. Their customer service is non existence....don’t come here.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>DO NOT GO HERE!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!! The guy here sold me his POS Subaru Forrester. I knew the brakes needed to replace, why a damn mechanic couldn't do that before selling his car should have told me not to. But to know you are selling a car to a mom with kids and KNOWING THAT CAR IS A DEATH TRAP is just plain wrong. I have tried messaging this guy, he wont return my calls, texts, nothing. Just to let y'all know just a COUPLE IMPORTANT things that are wrong....NO PARKING BREAK, FRONT AXLE IS CRACKED, ELECTRICAL WIRING IS ALL WRONG, NAILS IN ALL TIRES, oh ya even the spare in the back had a nail in it. I wish, I WISH there was more to do. I will continue to bash this guy, he and his partner are SEE YOU NEXT TUESDAYS!! ugh POS men!!!!</Text><GmapID>0x808fbfd96d627e75:0x83066f6d0b713d78< /GmapID><resp>None</resp>< Rate>

<Review>Came here several times for oil changes.... too many pot head looking dudes here that makes you question if they even do the job right since you can’t really see what they’re doing.
Most of them try to be smart ass. I’ll say only go to this place if it’s really needed. They ain’t worth it... Sears at mowry is super cheap and better oil quality and more trusty ask for GM Tim at auto center.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x808fbfd96d627e75:0x83066f6d0b713d78<//Gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

It is kinda pricey, but it definitely is fast. you stay in your car the whole time and watch as they change your oil and wash your windows. Its an interesting experience, and if i am in the neighborhood and i need to change my oil, i would definitely go back.<//review>

I had the full service done and it mentions air filter inspection. They never checked or recommend changing out. I checked my self and turns out I need to change my air filter. I would love to pay more at this location if they had recommended.<//text>

<Review>The guys there are amazing, like they are born oil changers .I had nut stripped and it was impossible to open it Mr Victor opened it like it's a bottle cap lol.
Ask for Victor whenever you go there that guy should be a district manager.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Time>1466122480926< /Time></record>

<Text>No Appointment ..but be prepared to be here for 30-40 mins...no restroom! If you have coupon's make sure you" SAY" that you do, more then once! Bunch of kid's working at this Location! Not very freindly! My Girlfreind asked ..if i could take her car in for a regular oil change...I didn't bring alot of cash..and my debit card wasn't going through..so my Girlfreind gave me her credit card...just in case!? She's used this card for her oil change's at this location for a few year's on the same vehicle..for a basic oil change! I went to pay..the oil changer employee..decided to give me HIGH MILEAGE OIL CHANGE...Which is $20 more than the basic oil change! And i wasn't asked if i needed or wanted the high mileage oil change..and they tried charging me $65 for this oil change! I refused to pay for the High mileage oil change ...but agreed to pay for the basic oil change..The cashier sayed i asked for High mileage oil change...When they in fact has me confused with customer that came in b4 me..and I have this problem with my debit card..and didnt have enough cash..and i went to use my Girlfreind's credit card! When i in fact had been at this SAME LOCATION...AND USED THIS CREDIT CARD..at every visit ...in the past year!  Since i didn't pay for the High Mileage oil change...the cashier refused to use the card because it wasn't me..so i explained to him that my Girlfreind used that card for the last couple of year's and that the car was her's and that ...I understood about security reason's but i didn't have enough cash on me...and that my debit card was messed up? And that i had been there for the last 4-5 oil change's and that i used same card..and that they were the same cashier that actually took the card every other time...so i asked for the manager..the manager took 15 min's just to come to tell me that he could'nt except my Gfreind's card! If i were trying to get over on them i explaind : I would have gotten the most expensive oil change..and all the trimming's..and with a different car?? So the manager told me..to go and get some other kind of payment..or they were basically keeping my Girlfreind's car for collateral  until i returned back with Girlfreind or enough money to pay for oil change! And couldn't barely speak english..or didn't want to..but then the manager said...to the cashier do u have the key's !?  ...So i felt like they messed up in the beginning. .and took it out on me ...because of there miscommunication!? And i can understand for security reason's about the credit card! But for a  basic oil change..i was wrongfully charged and accused of lieing and credit card theft ? And stolen vehicle/theft...I thought maybe since they messed up..they could have givin me a discount on oil change..or givin it to me for free..for making feel like a bad guy and puting me in an uncomfortable situation..when in fact..we chose that oil change location..for the 30-40 min oil change..because we thought it was fast and convenient..but one would think that keeping customers coming is job security! What ever happen to CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  LOL!!  I GUESS THAT'S JUST SOMETHING FROM THE PAST!! ?   :(          HAVE A NICE DAY!!< /Text>< Rate>

<Text>I've been here many times but I'm done. Tried to get my oil changed today at 6:15 but they turned me away and said that the car they we're working on was the last one and they are closed. Their posted hours say they're open til 7. This place is a little overpriced so I'll be shopping around.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808fbfd96d627e75:0x83066f6d0b713d78</gmap_id></record>

< Review>
My experience with Tradeline Supply Company was absolutely phenomenal!
They did exactly what they said they would do, in the time frame that they said it would be done.  If I have one criticism, it would be that they are sometimes hard to reach via telephone.  I highly recommend their service for those in need of help.  Make sure you choose tradelines based more on age than on limits.  Tristan was very helpful in answering my questions and straight forward with his answers.  You can't go wrong with  the Tradeline Supply Company, LLC.< /Review>

<Review>I was a little hesitant at first. But I would like to thank Tristen for his excellent c.service. He patiently answered all my tons of questions, gave me accurate information, help me to extend my tradeline. He even folloqed up on his commitment to calling me the next day along with a email. He is very polite, educate with company/product/services, and very professional. He definitely deserves a recognition. Thank you again for all you help /patience & will definitely recommend this company to anyone who needs assistance.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had an issue with my account being charged 3 times more that what was supposed. Lu Llinnas made sure he took care of the situation and followed up with a call and email every day until it was resolved. Issue was resolved within a matter of 2 days! Really appreciate the attentiveness, response time and professionalism from him!
Thanks again Lu!< /Text>

When speaking with customer service (specifically Erica) she was very patient with me while i was being indecisive. I genuinely felt that the company cared about educating me on what might be the best trade line for me. I would definitely recommend this business to others.</Review></record>

Great company to work with. Don't listen to the negative reviews I feel as if they are written with extreme emotions. This service varies depending on different factors, but the matter of fact is that there are many people who's scores have increased compared to those that haven't. It's just that they didn't write a review. As reviews for anything, people write them only  when they are on a polar side. The company is more than happy to work with you to solve a problem you might have.</review>

<Review>I purchased a tradeline for myself and my girlfriend on Black Friday(so I got a good deal for both of us). The account posted right towards the end of the given timeframe. So that was a good start. when I looked at my score I was so proud of myself. I got boosted 65 in one bureau, 72 on another and 70 something on the 3rd bureau. To anyone who is having doubts about using this service. I strongly recommend Tradeline Supply Comp. IT WORKS! Obviously try to work on your credit first before spending money on a tradeline. These people are not magicians. THANKS TSC for getting me closer to 800+ credit. Happy New Years< /Review>< Time>

<review>Update 08/25/2020: I was able to get 25% of what I paid back from the company great customer service in at least doing that - I would suggest if you use this company speak with someone about your credit situation and get advice on how you should handle your situation and what credit needs suit your situation!

was pricey and although they clearly state they don’t guarantee this will even make your credit score go up then their prices should be way lower. I took a risk and didn’t get the results I was hoping for this was a waste of money. I wouldn’t suggest going this route!</review>< GmapID>

They offered me a full refund but I refused and purchased a better tradeline thanks to the 15% increase they gifted me for my troubles. Hopefully this tradeline goes well....

No matter how much they try to tell you they don’t know how much your credit will go up thats because it won’t go up any points. My scores were 650 and up. The tradeline has reported and decreased my score 107 points. They make you pay using your bank account and routing number because in the banking world it is harder to dispute ACH transactions when the services provided to you were not correct. They advertise it can help your credit but why would it hurt someone’s credit? Who pays for a service to potentially hurt their credit? Deceiving and misleading practices. It’s been 2 weeks and my credit was damaged that fast. When I emailed the company about the drop in my credit score they sent me a 5 page copied and paste unprofessional disclaimer and showed no interest in my inquiry. I will gladly except a full payment return or contact a few local attorneys to see if they can assist me with this issue while contacting news channels.< /Review>< pics>

I am in the process of having them sell my trade lines so far the communication has been great. I have 24 cards that will be available soon to help all their customers that need a boost. Get your credit right and you can switch from buyer of trade lines to seller. I watch all the YouTube videos. Great info. I would like to see a paid training master class. This info is literally life altering. No one teaches this stuff in main stream. Keep doing a great job.< /review>

<Text>This company is legit!!! I was very skeptical when I read the reviews of 50-100 point increases to various credit reports, but it's a good thing I was wrong. My credit jumped up by 112 points.  As long as you know and understand your credit,  whether it's an issue with credit limit,  age,  or both this will be an easy process and fix. I will be a repeat customer.<//Text>< Pictures>

One client saw a 160 point increase, the Second saw a 56 point increase and the third one now has a 712 mid score....I can't thank Lu at Tradeline Supply for all his help and guidance. I look forward to doing LOTS of business with him in 2020 !!!

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>This company use to be great to sell your trade lines with, but they went downhill FAST!   The worst thing that a company like this can do is get careless and greedy with selling your Authorized User slots.    Within the past 6 orders, two of them had incorrect information provided.  This is a surefire way to get your credit card SHUT DOWN quick
Other companies pay more anyways, so avoid these people and go somewhere else if you want to make more money consistently short term and long term.< /Text>< Time>

<Text>Tradeline Supply Company, is 100% solid. I purchased 2 large seasoned trade lines. I was very skeptical at first, because I just could not believe it would be this easy. I purchased the tradelines according to the posting dates listed on the website. As promised, the trade lines hit within a day of the listed posting on the website. I was amazed at how my credit score increased over a very short time frame. Thank you Tradeline Supply Company with helping to boost my credit score.< /Text>< pictures>

Tradeline supply is the place to go if you need knowledge of tradelines. Going to there website is like going to college for tradelines.  Prices are great. They have a guarantee which is very important to me. Makes me feel comfortable spending my money. If anyone says something bad about this company it's because they didn't follow the proper steps to receive the most from you lines. They won't misguide you
Listen and be patient. Tradeline Supply will change your life.<//review>

They are the real deal, I was kinda nervous at first, I was caution because their site doesn’t have a green lock Icon on the web address, which is an indicator for secure site, but I went and tried the trade line. The trade line hit my account the last day of which they said it would, and my score went up 35 points pushing me to 772 Experian score. I spoke with Todd and he told me if it didn’t post that he would refund my money after reviewing proof of none posting. The good thing is that it all worked out and I will definitely work with trade line supply company again. Great Job!!!< /Review>

Haven’t received my Tradeline yet but I have no worries in the world, ordered a Tradeline earlier in the month it didn’t go through because I barley missed the timeline I contracted them and they fix the problem immediately.. Todd answered all my questions and was perfect throughout the entire process. He switched me onto a new Tradeline and even gave me a DISCOUNT! Would recommend 100 percent.<//Review>

< review>
I usually don't leave reviews, but the products, service, and information this company offers is life changing!
Initially, I began by subscribing to their mailing list. The information they send out is, in my opinion, just as valuable as the tradelines they offer. Based on the information they provided, I began cleaning up my own credit. I had most of my success in deleting derogatory information by submitting goodwill letters. After my credit was cleaned up a bit, all three of my FICO scores went from high 500s to being in the 650 - 660 range. At that point, I purchased an AU tradeline from Tradeline Supply Company that had over 10 years of history and a $10,000 credit limit for about $700. After the tradeline posted, all of my scores increased to low 700s. A week later, I had another negative account deleted from my credit report by using a goodwill letter and now all of my Fico 8 scores are Ex 740, Eq 752, and TU 765 (Fico 9 scores a bit higher). Before beginning this process I could only get secured credit cards and high interest auto loans. In the last two weeks after the tradeline posted, I have been able to refinance my wife's car at an interest rate of 4.7% (was 14%), got approved to purchase a new car at an interest rate of 3.5%, and have gotten approved for two credit cards; one from NFCU with a $20,000 limit and another from PenFed with a $40,000 limit. On top of that, a secured card I had with Wells Fargo is now unsecured with a $10,000 limit and I got my deposit back.
I was skeptical at first because I saw some bad reviews about this company. Anyone leaving negative reviews and bad info about this company is full of $h!t and could potentially be hurting people by steering them away from something they really need to help them get back on their feet. This is a real review and I can honestly say that you can purchase tradelines from them with confidence.<//review>

<review>5 Stars are easy to give when people simply do what they say they’re going to do. I can’t tell you how many individual people and companies over promised and under delivered...scammed me! Tradeline Supply Company is the “ONLY” company that did EXACTLY what they offered. The timing, age, limit and price, was all on point! Let me also add, the timing was critical because I had to plan my profile as to when to apply for a credit card...and because there were zero delays with TSC, I got the card I was looking for...even though they (TSC) informed me through their disclosure, there are no guarantees as to the outcome of the purchased tradelines, and that was extremely fair. Would I buy from Tradeline Supply Company LLC again? Do you really have to ask?
Answer: YES!

I have contacted many different companies in the tradelines space, & have identified Tradeline Supply Company as being the most professional & demonstrating the highest level of integrity. Whether you're interested in being added to a high-quality seasoned tradeline, or if you have quality tradelines to list, you can't go wrong with these guys.</Text>

<review>I knew this seemed too good to be true. I just had a zoom meeting with this company and after an hour of listening to them talk about the company it ended with them asking us to pay them a fee to become an employee of theirs. I thought this was an employment job not a membership with a chance of making money.< /review>< Pics>

I booked a rental car through one of their affiliate travel agents. Was never provided any terms and conditions of the reservation. When due to circumstances we were unable to take possession of the rental and asked to have a refund we were then told that refunds were only available within the first 24 hours of booking the reservation for the rental car. Not once was I provided any terms and conditions nor did the travel agent provide me any terms and conditions concerning my rental.<//Review>

<gmap_id>0x80c2ea14a2818517:0x7c78e6fee5b6ba4e<//gmap_id><Text>A travel agent dubbed as the Prettypreneurs is too unprofessional. She is rude. She provided inaccurate information without doing the research. She would quote pricing without actually checking ATS website. After she gathers indo she will contact you with new info that is very different than what was quoted. She was referred to me by an associate.  I recently booked a Jamaica trip through her to which she appeared to be lackadaisical when it came to arranging our vacation. My main issue with this trip was her work ethic. She explained itineraries incorrectly leaving the travel to conduct their own research because she is untrustworthy. She also isn't personable with clients. She is the travel agent.  It is assumed she would know more about travel requirements and changed. She totally leaves this up to the traveler.  Which you as a traveler would not know how to choose the best accommodation given that they haven't visited before. I was sadden by this agent because I referred several people to her including my adult daughter. She was changing resorts and pricing due to Covid, but was not vocal at all.about the changes and options for the traveler. It was kinda like... you get what you get. There is no legit refund policy. She totally lied about that. She stated that a refund could be given before 30 days. When attempted to cancel within the 30 days she stated that we couldn't get all of our money back. If she would've been honest than we would've know how to advocate for ourselves. So at that point your stuck dealing with her. I had to lose my cool with her when she screwed my daughter and neices on their up coming trip to the Bahamas. I understand Covid has gotten in the way of many plans, however simply communication would have suffice. I'm very disappointed in this girl because I have referred 3 people in the time I've known her and each person had an issue. And of course they called me because I referred her. Do better so called Prettypreneurs< /Text><rate>2< /rate>< Response>

< Review>
Go ahead and get your travel booked by calling or walking in by one of their agents! They are very detailed and organized and make sure to get you all the details and what you need to know before going on a trip. They get what you want. They do group cruises, families, individuals, all inclusive resorts, weekend getaways, international travel and more. They can help book your air, car rentals, hotels, drink packages, excursions and more.. do you want to go on a cruise and want to know the best time of the year for the place you want to go?? They have really helped me find that out so I book the best time of the year.<//Review>

< Review>
If I could give less stars I would! Horrible experience! My husband and I booked a cruise that we were told was all inclusive for our honeymoon.  Two days before departure we found out it wasn't.  We had to spend an additional 500.00 for alcohol packages. I called corporate requested a call from the owner they told me he was in Alaska. Haven't heard anything. The agent then told us she would give us half of our money back when we returned. We have yet to receive anything. Not to mention they didnt add the private dinner he requested either. NEVER AGAIN< /Review>

Since the travel agent paid for the trip already and the supplier used your money to book the trip. The agent would have had to pay you out of pocket to give you money half the money of your trip you already experienced. I apologize about the experienced.

Horrible experience. I thought working with a travel agent would be less stressful. Originally had another booking agent but something happened and Jill took over. Jill do not like to respond back (email) and if she do she will not answer important questions also never return phone calls<//review>

Not only are these five star reviews are not genuine and from people that obviously connected to the shop in some way. To add on top of that they are using photos from another shop. their shop is terrible keeping animals in cracked aquariums and a bad selection of sick fish with questionable prices. AVOID AT ALL COST!! Nightmare of a store I feel for all the poor animals inside. also just a side note we were completely ignored when we walked in the store is like 100 square feet the owner didn't say a word. Just yikes. I wish I had a picture of what the store actually looked like.</review>

Absolute nightmare of a pet store. If you believe in animal rights you will not shop at this establishment. None of the habitats for the animals or fish were suitable for living. They literally had 2 full size roosters in a 20 gallon aquarium with a lid on it!!! That’s completely unacceptable and show probably be reported.<//Text>

It is in my opinion, the 5 star reviews here are either outdated or misleading, and written by people who are associated with this store. The store is dimly lit and a little messy, the corals all look dead, and there is a big parrot losing its feathers inside a small cage. It isn't nice inside but their small selection of fish do seem to be healthy and taken cared of, and there seems to be a decent selection of basic fish supplies. I was hoping to discover a cool fish shop and I regret having wasted my time coming here after reading the false high star reviews.< /Text>

I have came here twice during business hours and neither time was there anyone there. The gates were up but the open sign was on. They wasted my time once but having it happen twice just shows how unprofessional and unreliable the management is.</Text>

Amazing experience and hands down best company for the product you receive! 50 year warranty plus tons of communication. Not sure how or why I see bad reviews here when I recieved a10 star service from James, Gerry and Carmen!   Green Living thank you for my new roof and solar. I will be calling you soon for my next job of coolwall paint for my home!<//review>

<name>Monique Landgren</name><Date>1619374016894<//Date><Rate>1</Rate><text>This company is very unprofessional and does not follow through on what is promised.  I have no idea how they have a 4.5 rating right now.  They failed to completely install ridge cap, didn't replace all necessary rafters, our fascia board is bowing, our drip edge isn't functioning the way it's supposed to because it was installed wrong, and they keep saying they are going to come out and fix things.  We have called numerous times and it has now been over a year since the project was "completed," yet no one did a final walk through.  We also discoverd that they never registered our roof for the 50 year warranty through Owens Corning.

An employee happened to share that they have numerous lawsuits due to some of the contractors they used that didn't hold up their end of the bargain and it looks as if we are going to have to get our lawyer involved now too.  It seems as if the issue goes beyond the poor work that their contractors did.  I wouldn't be surprised if they have plenty of friends and family on here leaving fake reviews.  Don't fall for their BS!  I recognize some of the names of the people who have written reviews on here that happen to be people we've spoke to at the Green Living office and even the guy that sold us our roof!</text>< pictures>

My grandmother did a quote and went with this company. She was planning to have multiple things done with them. It has been at least three weeks since the workers came to start everything, now she has to call them to get any answers as to when they will clean the paper and plastics tapped around her home and actually start the painting. It was not easy for her to agree to do this with covid and all. They do not call her or keep her informed on anything. If an issue with scheduling came up that's fine, but CALL! Now she is left chasing for any answers or updates and being worried she just lost a good deal of money working with this company. Definitely be careful and make sure to ask a ton of questions. We found them on line and they had really good reviews so she went with them, but so far the customer service has been horrible and we have to worry they are taking advantage of her and that is just not right! Hopefully they will make it right soon, but as of now I would definitely warn anyone thinking of using them.<//review>

Quote on TexCote house painting:
Yesterday a sales person came to my door and asked if I was interested in having my house painted due to visible fading and some stucco damage.  Normally I would say No to door to door sales, but since I had just been thinking it might be nearing time to have stucco repaired and house re-painted, I said Yes.. The next day, Ryan showed up at agreed time.  He first inspected the exterior paint and did some measurements.  Afterwards, he gave me a very thorough overview of the TexCote process, explaining the step to step details and showing me photos and samples.  He answered all my questions and made it easy for me to understand the process.  As this process happened on me very unexpectedly, I am not ready to commit today without further reviewing my options and finances.  Regardless of my future decisions which will be based on multiple personal & financial  factors, Ryan's presentation was very impressive and I would recommend giving GreenLiving a chance to quote your project.  They were very thorough and professional which I will take into consideration when I am ready to commit to this project.</text>

We got our roof done with Green Livng and I would have to say it was the best investment we ever made. From the great production team,Carmen to the roofing crew we were not at all disappointed. We will be using and reffering greenlving to family and freinds.< /review>

I would definitely recommend Green Living, they did an amazing job!! Keith was very professional, he took the time to thoroughly explain the process of replacing my roof with me and my wife. I was very reluctant to move forward as I've had several bad experiences with other contractors but Keith made us feel very comfortable moving forward with the project. We had several quotes that were cheaper but I did not want the same experience we had seen in the past with poor quality. Jimmy and Carmen were fantastic, keeping us updated with the entire process. The crew went above and beyond what was promised and I could not be happier with the end result. I reccomended greenliving to several friends and family members and I highly reccomend these guys for any remodeling. They are top notch!!< /text>

GreenLiving Is an amazing company. If you're looking for Home Improvement services, they are your go-to. They treat you like family and truly deliver exceptional results in the services they offer. They clean up after themselves and are there every step of the way to answer any questions or concerns. I would strongly recommend them to anyone.<//Review>

What can I say other then WOW! Such a great company, FREE estimates! They didn’t pressure to me hire them when they came to give the estimate they were honest of how bad my roofing was (which I kinda knew was bad). Ryan the rep I spoke to is very knowledgeable and even explained the process of how it was all going to get fixed and how to care for my roof after.< /review>

I was referred to green living from s friend that got their roof done.  They came out gave me an estimate on my roof and I have to say process was unique to say the least. Dan was the rep and he represented the company well. Not making the move yet but maybe later next year< /Review>

Hello I usually don’t leave reviews but my experience with GreenLiving was good I decided to leave a review! I had been looking around at different companies and gotten estimates and to be honest I didn’t get good vibes from other companies maybe cause I’m a single woman they taught I would just settle for whatever, however when Geenliving Came to my house for my estimate they were very respectful and I felt the quote they gave me was well priced. I decided to hire the company... they came did the job efficiently! They were very professional and courteous! I’m so glad I found them! Thanks Ryan (rep for green living) for your help during the process your company is lucky to have a employee like yourself!</text>

I called green living for an inspection my roof was leaking. They went on my roof and took pictures of the damaged area.  They showed me some options and I went with purchasing an entire roof.  The price was decent but the quality of the materials was the best.  Took a couple of weeks but my new roof is amazing.  I will definitley consider hyphen for future projects</text>

Chris & Dan came over to do a roof inspection.  Even though the roof did not need immediate repairs, they were very detailed oriented explaining to me how the roofs are installed, pointed out some areas of concern and provided me with a fair estimate should I decide to replace it in the near future. Very honest, knowledgeable and I felt they care for the customer above sales.</text>

If I could leave negative stars, I would! My elderly parents have been waiting on this unprofessional company to do an overlay on their roof for nearly a month. Not only does this company NOT communicate with its customers they also LIE about when the work will be done. They've blamed delays on the city inspectors and permits when the city has already done their part. There are materials sitting on my parents roof and a ladder propped up against the roof sitting idle. Rain is predicted for a good portion of Christmas week and still no sign of any urgency by this company to complete, excuse me, START their job. And they are expecting a "good review" from my parents? No damn way! Absolutely no excuse for such abhorrent unprofessionalism. Steer clear of this company!</Text>

Unfortunately we have no control over the city inspectors and in this case La Mirada was behind on their schedule.

< Review>
Green Living applied a Tex coat paint to my house after having a bad stucco job by another contractor.  The paint has a finish just as if you had applied a new coat of stucco. Amazing product.  They finished Two days ahead of time.  If, I needed any changes, no problem. The workers were there to do a good job. The quality of work was very good, they were neat, the office worker Joana was outstanding.  The entire staff was very professional. I would use this Company again and definitely recommend this company.<//Review>

<Time>1536711392020<//Time><Rating>4<//Rating><Review>UPDATE: I have spoken with Green living and received an apology for all of the inconvenience and stress. I need to specify that they did a great job with painting the house. They were very careful with their work and took all the steps to prime the house before painting. They covered all the windows/doors/fixtures so no paint would end up where it isn’t supposed to be. It was a three day process. Very efficient. Very good work.

My issue is this: I am a surfer and my family had our house painted and fixed up this past week. Friday, when the job was completed, my 9ft surf board went missing... naturally I jumped to it being stolen. I tried to call the company many times and speak with them personally about this but THEY'RE CLOSED SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

Sunday my neighbor pointed out that the painters thought the only logical place to move my board was ON THE ROOF. Out of sight. To bake in the sun (which is bad). For days. And not tell anyone. Then leave. (because against a wall in the shade is an outlandish option obviously). Moral of the story: If anything of yours goes missing check the roof before you freak out. 👍🏼<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I had multiple days during the holidays and went to Owens corning website looking for a reputable contractor as my dad was very happy with his roof in Detroit.  They recommended platinum dealer Greenliving as I was required in Los Angeles County to get a cool reflective roof.  Tim Harrison came out during the holidays even though their offices were closed and was able to temporarily tarp so there wasn’t further damage.  They installed the roof in five days at the first of the year and I added V Lux skylights for additional light and ventilation.  Thanks again Tim and greenliving.< /review>< pics>

<text>Green living is a must have in your contact list.

I must say they have been the most helpful contractor my wife and I have ever used. We had a roof issue that we knew about and asked for their help. Not only did they do a thorough inspection with photos and great explanation of all our options, but they made it easy to accomplish.

We where used to having to pay out of pocket for all repairs done to the house, or put it on a credit card if you are lucky enough to find a contractor that excepts them.

Turns out they have great financing options. Even some that utilize the PACE program. The rates where so good we decided to do everything on our wishlist: Windows, Stucco Repairs, and our Roof.

The cherry on top was that all the products we chose where energy efficient.

Don't waste your time calling around. The buck stops here. Great value! Very professional. Amazing quality.< /text>< username>

I can speak from personal experience; my parents recently wanted to paint their home and I recommended Green Living because I trusted Tim Harrison to manage the project and I love the Cool Wall product.  Tim is a true professional, and this was reflected 100% by the crew who cleaned up after themselves each and every day.  The work is excellent.

< Review>
I just recently had a new roof installed on my home. I have to say I ended up very pleased with Danny from Green Living. I'd been searching for a good contractor for quite a while and after 3 estimates, I decided to balance quality with price and Green Living became my choice. After dealing with the issues I had with previous contractors, I was very skeptical and nervous about working with a new company. Most of my issues with previous contractors were due to issues never being resolved, and me not being able to get in touch with them after the job was complete.

I can't say the job went PERFECT... I did have a few concerns that arose and as a homeowner, many of you may be able to relate when I say it was very hard to hold back these concerns during the process. However, every time I had an issue and voiced my concern to Danny, he either addressed it immediately, or explained it would be taken care of at the end of the job.

I was beyond impressed to find that every promise he made was kept. Everything I considered an issue was completely taken care of to my expectations, and my roofing project is now complete.

The roof not only looks beautiful, but my home has cooled down quite a bit due to the way in which they ventilate the attic. I am very happy with the end result, and I will be going straight to them next time I need work done in my home.

<user>117659356986411362316< /user><review>We moved into my new home in September and started looking for a company for roof and solar.  We found GreenLiving through an online ad and decided to request

GreenLiving provided a good experience, price, and experience. We scheduled a second meeting as my wife had to leave during the first meeting an they wanted my wife to be there as it is a big investment and I guess they want to make sure we were both on board.  David came back again and this time it was more of a choosing the color for the roof and maybe some upgrades to their 7 layer roof which we completely fell in love with.

The crew came a week later for tear off and they were sociable, very professional.  David kept in contact with us to make sure everything was going good and it was. The company provides extensive warranties through owens corning with very good pricing considering the quality of the roof products. For solar we chose mission solar, the panels are made in the united states and that was important to us. If you're going to do solar, make sure you go with American made – they last much longer.  They are beautiful panels as well.

This is a big investment but greenliving made it a very smooth and peaceful process, no stress.

We had a friend that worked for Solar City and he was trying to get us to go with him but as uncomfortable as it was we stuck with GreenLiving, GreenLiving was a bit pricier but we just felt good about them.  I would rather pay a bit more for quality and peace of mind. I never go with the cheapest so this is no different. I see that they do charity work as well they have a video on their website where they gave a veteran a new roof for free, those things really say a lot about a company.

One thing that we were concerned about with any other company was how they would honor the warranties.  Would they go out of business, would they give me a hard time if something went wrong.  Worst thing would be to drop a bunch of money to find out later company jumped shipe.  We really dug into greenliving and they’ve won awards and they are associated with a lot of big associations.. those things matter to us.

The guys from GreenLiving had asked to see quotes from the other providers and insisted they would be competitive or even match their pricing.  With the quality of the roof and the 12 solar panels we got the price was more than fair and worth it.

We’ve had to get a hold of greenliving a time or two to ask some questions about our solar panels as well as roof questions and we have always been able to get a hold of them directly no automated service –always a live person

The install process was pretty smooth.  Considering it does get messy from time to time – I mean they are tearing off and installing a roof they did a good job with cleanup.  The tear off was done in 1 day and they bring a truck to take all the trash and debris away.  That’s part of the service.  There was even a guy that came after everything was hauled off walking my yard with a metal detector to make sure he found any screws and nails that may have fallen,  I thought that was pretty cool.

As far as the solar installation that was pretty straight forward.  One thing I noticed it was another crew, not the same crew that installed our roof.  I was told that roofers only do roof and solar crews only do solar so we can know that each crew is an expert in their field

it was a bit confusing getting our solar activated but after speaking with greenliving they walked us through how to do all that

After the roof installation and solar installation AJ the general manager came by to make sure everything was in working order and thank goodness everything was fine.

We recommend greenliving, this is a great company.< /review>< Rate>

Take away the issue regarding the unexpected $2,400 bill for wood replacement (previous scathing review on Yelp), would you want to have your roof replaced  by a business partner (Adam, co owner) who basically calls you a liar?
Yes, I explained the entire scene where I watched a member from their tare off crew, go behind my garage for less than a minute (rest of crew by vehicles getting ready to leave), then watched him exit the yard the same way he came in. Then all the crew members drove away. I immediately walked behind the garage and saw a large foamy damp spot in the dirt.
After hearing this, Adam stated, "maybe it was water".
REALLY? FROM AN OWNER? Wow...<//text>

I live and work in Torrance and try to support local businesses. I had to replace the windows on my home and I called a few local companies for quotes. The first couple of companies that came out were priced higher than I thought they should be. Green Living was the 3rd company that came out and I am glad that they did. Their representative David explained very thoroughly the benefits of their windows and he gave me a fair price. I felt that they were best suited to handle replacing all of my windows. I signed up with them that evening. The job was done and the house looks great. They kept to their schedule and more importantly to their word. I will have them out when I need my roof replaced.</Text>

Dear GreenLiving...the jerk that you have delivering flyers in my neighboorhood, could see me sitting inside, not coming to the door and proceeded to yell through the window for about two minutes and then fold up the flyer and throw it at my door because I didn't answer....I work from home, I was on a conference call, which heard all of his banter...NICE business.  I won't be calling for an estimate.< /Review>

Our roof looks GREAT!!! Awesome finished product.
As for this companies professionalism (cursing), honesty (contact issues), reliability (3 start dates & no-shows), quality of work (with some of the contractors, not all) and the turf and it's quality that they "installed"; well, if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all. So, this is where I end my review. But on a positive note, again, our roof looks AMAZING!< /Review>

Like Tami Torres I was visited by one of their salespersons.  I was in the middle Of a project and  repeatedly  told him but I did not have time to speak with him and he could leave a flyer.  He attempted over and over to ask my name, my husband.   After about five minutes of badgering he stated he couldn’t leave the flyer if he didn’t have this information. I told him and only a flyer. After that he proceeded to address me in a profanity laced tirade    Thankfully my Doorbell caught it all on tape.    I would never use this company.<//review>

Salesman named “T.J” rings my doorbell, waits 10 seconds then proceeds to walk to the side of my house and urinate on my wall.  When caught in the act, he tries to say he is emptying a water bottle.  Your salesman then has the audacity to try to talk to me about my roof lol.  Keep your genitals in your pants T.J, especially when I live right across from a middle school.</text>

<text>I’m writing this review on behalf of my Mom in Anaheim, CA. She’s so excited about her new roof, but still doesn’t know how to use a computer to write it herself!

She told me that she loved working with her salesman, Greg. He had been incredibly patient and informative when answering her questions, responsive to all phone calls and emails, and was just amazing throughout the entire process.

Initially she was nervous and overwhelmed, not knowing what to expect. Greg had been thorough and detail-oriented when educating her about the features and benefits of the Owens Corning system.

She just loves her new roof and wants me to relay the message. Thanks for taking such great care of my mom, Greg with GreenLiving!< /text>< time>

Great company! First off the bat I was looking for a reputable company that would swap my old, rotten, and infested wood windows with some energy efficient windows. Of course i needed to see my options and see how much window construction cost. After spending a good four months looking into windows, i knew what i wanted on my home and started calling contractors for estimates. Soon enough one of there sales reps came over and informed me on different types of windows and gave me the pros and cons. He gave me an offer that i could not refuse, and he even added a beautiful bay window for free! There windows are the best of the best! Not to mention there crew was on time and always left everything clean not like other contractors that leave a mess get there check and get on there way! Tim was also extremely detailed with the process and was very professional! Great company, i would definitely recommend them!</review>

<review>I was recently elected president of my HOA and was faced with the daunting task of finding window replacements for all twenty of our townhouse units.  As a matter of course we requested 4 different quotes and at the end of the process the board unanimously agreed to go with Green Living.  Not only were we most impressed with their professionalism and window quality but their pricing was very competitive as well.

The entire project was completed within a couple weeks and we did not receive a single complaint from any of the twenty residences, a new record!  Thank you Green Living for your top to bottom professionalism, I look forward to doing business again in the future.</review><response>{'time': 1515015280993, 'text': 'We thank you for trusting us to do your project and most definitely look forward to working with you again soon!'}< /response><Rating>5< /Rating><Date>1475516684348< /Date></record></dataset><record>

<review>We are very happy with our new paver backyard thanks to Green Living and our salesman Ricardo who made it easy to visualize the colors and design but gave us a great deal and payment option that I didn't know existed in my area. Ricardo checked on the job regularly ( took about 4 days). We were very impressed with the crew and  their attention to detail. My pavers job was for our backyard pool area and it came out exactly the way I wanted. Now aim proud of hosting parties or events unlike before. I will definitely recommend friends and family for future events and will be working with this company in my own future projects.< /review>< response>

The work looks great and was done in a neat & timely manner. The workers acted professional and were very polite. I highly DON'T recommend the PACE financing option. Full lending details are not disclosed and there are many fees added. Also, you can not pay it off in full until 4-6 weeks after they file a lien on your property with your county. We were very unhappy with this loan policy as we had wanted to avoid this action. When I asked CalFirst to show me where in the contract it states a payoff could not be made right away, they said, "It doesn't." Do your best to avoid financing this way because at the end of the term + fees you pay almost double the initial price!< /text>

I own a small business. I contacted them to fix some plumbing issues we were having. Great customer service by all but especially Taylor. He was terrific. Went above and beyond. When I had issues with my water heater months later I knew who to call. Joe was the first person on site the same day. Super knowledgeable and laid out my options. We ultimately  agreed on a new water heater as my current one was old and needed a lot of new parts to keep it running. This was a big job and it was a big cost but they worked with me on financing and put my mind at ease. Amram, Bryce and Joe were great. Their communication and professionalism during the two days they were on site were incredible. 10 stars!!!!!<//Review>

Can’t say anything Good about the technician who came and gave us a bid and did the work and did not resolve any issue that was described. I was left with leaky double wall vent (which is inside our garage and dangerous) and without any heating as this was the issue related. Called them same day, no return, emailed and still no return, called on Saturday and they said Monday someone will contact me for assistance and here I am with a leaky vent pipe which has combustion gases coming into my house if heating is on. And plus cold house. They charge us $1006 and I only went with them cause of the guarantee of this repair would be solving my issue and At the end tech Morgan said this would solve part of the issue and I told him I went with all he recommended and asked 3 times prior to starting the job, if this would solve my issue and the answer was yes. After installed and charged my card, he said this would take care of half of the issue and something extra would need to be done in order to solve the other half. Ended up not solving anything and made it worse and unsafe for me to stay home with the heating system on. My review will stay online until this matter is resolved or money ia returned cause now I also have to fix the cut on the drywall that was made for now reason other than trying to sell and make more on clients. I will wait to hear from this 5 star guarantee service company.

Updating review:
Office called and sent their tech to take a look and found out what was going on. After he came by nothing has been done and the issue is just worse. Found out that where his tech Morgan worked he left the tubes loose and open and air was going directly into the attic and not supplying the house. Over all I have been with the house super cold and not able to get a resolution even after I said that I don’t mind spending the money to have it fix right. But now what I told them after those days is that I want my system the same way it was when they came to work on it. For the last 1 year the system worked much better than after their work; and I requested to make sure they remove their parts installed and leave my system as it was and refund the money cause nothing has worked as expected! Our system has been working okay and we wanted to be great when we hired them, but ended up being worse and now I am with a big problem in my hands and I will have to find someone else to resolve this issue< /text>

<Review>My toilets tank stopped receiving water and I decided to call a couple places to see what it would be to have it looked at. This place was the first one I called.

They said for $89 they could come out and diagnose the problem and give me an estimate on what it would be to fix it. While I was on the phone with them I found a couple other options for $50 to come out and do the same thing, so I told them thanks, I will think about it and give them a call back. The lady on the phone then told me hold on, let me talk to the manager and I can get that $89 service fee waived, and so I just went ahead and decided to use them.

The guy who came out was great, nice professional etc. He took a look at my toilet and was able to tell me the problem was my corroded shut off valve stopping the water flow and he did this by connecting a feeder hose to see if water was still flowing just somehow being blocked by the valve. He was quick to diagnose the problem and clear on what it was.
Then I asked for an estimate for this repair. It was $400 - the $89 dollar service fee credit which goes toward the repair so it brought my grand total to $311. That price was absolutely outrageous. The part was a $12 dollar part from home depot. All you need is a wrench to remove and replace it. For me to shut off my water, and remove/replace this piece took me 10 minutes. There isnt anything special involved or any fancy special tools required to do this. It was as simple as unscrewing something and screwing the new one on (and shutting off the water before doing this) It is not rocket science. I have no experience with plumbing and I did it myself.

Anyway the 1 start review is because of the insane pricing. $400 for coming over and replacing a 10$ piece? The labor doesn't even take 20 minutes.

Anyway, I told the guy I was just going to fix it myself because $400 is a bit much unless you could bring the price down. He was firm on the pricing, and said its set by management at most he could call and ask but he knows they wont change it so I went ahead and ended up paying the $89 service fee and that was that.

What confuses me is he could of just knocked like 100 off the price and it would of still been outrageous but I'd of done it. I don't know anyone who wouldn't be happy to make over $200 just to screw some part on. As long as its not totally obscence pricing I'd go with it, but less then 20 minutes of basic labor and screwing on a part that costs 12$ at home depot that they carry for $400 is their normal pricing? You'd have to be a complete idiot to go with that.</Review><Resp>{'time': 1530125329867, 'text': 'Good Morning Irene Wolfey,\nWe are sorry to hear that you were disappointed with our service.

We interviewed a number of plumbers and are so pleased that we chose Stevenson Plumbing to do our work for us. They gave us one estimate, there were no surprises or added costs, they spent a good deal of time making sure every detail was perfect before they completed the job. They installed a hot cold faucet on our kitchen sink, along with the hot water dispenser and a new water filter. They were professional, answered all her questions, and were incredibly good humored and positive throughout the whole job. So happy with their work.<//Review>

<text>Extremely nice on the phone, texted a photo of the serviceman that would arrive. Taylor was genuinely kind and considerate, he explained the situation clearly and honestly, made sure that we understood the cost before he worked. He did a great job, double checked everything and also told us how to prevent drain clog in the future. Payment processing was easy, paperless and had no hidden fees. An honest family owned business. The best plumbing company we’ve worked with in over 15 years living in Vista and Carlsbad. Highly recommended!</text>< Pictures>

Our hot water heater blew and was not detected until late in the afternoon.  My husband called John Stevenson Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning.  They sent Ryan over 15 minutes later to assess the situation, remove the unit and provide options for a new one.  It was amazing how quickly they responded to our emergency!

We also had the chance to meet Alex and Alex, the installers who would be doing the work the following day.  They did an amazing job, even sweeping out the remaining water from the garage.

All staff members were extremely professional, friendly, and took the necessary COVID precautions by wearing masks and maintaining a six foot distance when necessary.  When coming into the house to check the hot water, shoe covers were worn to protect the hardwood floors from getting dirty or wet.

This customer-oriented company did not disappoint us in the least!</Review>

I see why these guys are so highly rated!  They were awesome!!  Squeezed me in the same day and worked around my availability which is super rare. Super professional, courteous, and friendly - Taylor was going but super knowledgeable and took care of everything and more. Was able to do the work for a great price and went the extra mile to make a few necessary adjustments and make sure everything was flowing smoothly. Highly recommend. Will definitely use them again!!< /Review>

<Text>Amazing response, efficient, courteous, and professional...that’s how I’d describe John Stevenson plumbing - Heating & Air!  Jaime, Travis, Alex Jr, and Alex Sr started working on our gas line leak within a couple of hours after my urgent call for assistance. They communicated clearly, were clean and respectful of my property, and worked efficiently as a team to get the job done. I felt like they had my best interest at heart, I didn’t feel like I was just another call to them. The paperwork was clear, no added gimmicks or surprises. The price quoted was just that, no “change in the middle of the job”. Their # went into my contacts and they will be my go to for any problem or need I have going forward!  Thank you gentlemen for the excellent service and making my home safe again :))
I highly recommend this company !!!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Our water heater gave up on us on the Saturday of President’s Day weekend (of course, a 3 day weekend)...we called John Stevenson Plumbing,  Armando promptly called us back,  and came out to assess our situation. It was nice that he texted us his photo, for security and ID purposes. He quoted us for the work, and he and Taylor were here bright and early Sunday morning to replace the water heater...they were polite, efficient and within hours we again had hot water!! They went over all the workings of our new unit...Armando and Taylor were fabulous, and we highly recommend John Stevenson Plumbing!!</review><rate>5<//rate>< Date>

<Review>Plumbing technicians were knowledgeable, thorough and were careful with their tools/equipment. They installed 5 faucets with drains and replaced all under sink plumbing including valves, traps etc. Additionally,  shutoff valve in my garage was replaced in order to regulate water pressure into my home. I highly recommend this company and would call on them again for future plumbing issues.<//Review>< UserId.>

The service/sales person was a great communicator. The Sales Manager was responsive and listened and understood our concerns. He addressed them and scheduled the installation. The installers were on-time and very professional. They had to perform some additional minor modifications that were not originally considered.

We had a leak in our water heater and needed immediate attention. I called around 5:30pm and I had a professional person named Mike, changing my water heater by 7:00pm on the same day!!! He didn’t leave until he made sure that my installation was perfect until past 9:30 pm.
Mike surprised me in a good way, the quality of his work and professionalism was amazing. I would 100% recommend them and use their service again!</Text>

Technician showed up on time and was able to solve the problem quickly and was very friendly. He went above and beyond by scheduling a time for his supervisor to come out with a scope to diagnose any problems that might exist at no extra cost. Taylor took his time to talk about other plumbing issues my recently purchased house might have and gave me tips. Taylor is an excellent technician. I would highly recommend.<//Text>

I attempted to replace my faucet cartridge by myself. Not sure I had the right tool to push the cartridge in all the way. John Stevenson came over and reinstalled the cartridge correctly. They only charged me the assessment fee instead of the 400 dollars it would cost to replace the cartridge. What a great value and I saved a ton of money to boot! I used these guys to replace my furnace. Their price was cheaper than ASI and Bill Howe!< /text>

My experience with John Stevenson Plumbing was great. Our air conditioner stopped blowing cool air in 90 degree weather and I was able to get an appointment within 24 hours! Morgan, the AC Technician, came out to help repair our AC unit and got it done quickly. Throughout the process he politely answered the questions I had and was very professional. Overall I am very happy with the service I received and will be doing business with this company going forward. Thank you.</text>

I found the listing on Google and filled out a bit of info on the site.  Someone immediately chatted with me about my needs and I had a call within 30 minutes stating someone would be out to evaluate the problem.  Michael, the drain technician, was polite and knowledgeable and left the bathroom as he found it.  Less than an hour's work and less than half a day from my call and all is running smoothly again.  Very pleased with the entire experience.  Highly recommend this company.< /text>

<review>Responded same day with a service call to address a leaking water heater one of my rental properties  The technician was Armando and he was excellent and well informed during our on-site q&a.  He replaced the heater in a few hours, showed me options for how to maintain it.  I found their monthly maintenance package to be a good value too as a landlord so I signed up for that as well.  All in all very easy and effective to work with, they will be my go-to for future needs on my properties and I will be requesting Amando for future work.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1606926387393, 'text': "We're delighted to hear that you had a positive experience with our company, Jim.

<Review>Morgan showed up on time, was friendly, knew his craft, and did the work quickly and thoroughly. I will recommend Morgan and John Stevenson’s company to all my friends and neighbors.

Michael came out and cleared a clogged line no fuss no worry, he was a pro, very friendly and explained everything he was doing.

Fantastic company with great employees< /Review>< Name>

Great service, very personable and professional  appears to have gotten the job done (we’ll see), but certainly overpriced for what we had done.  I’d be reluctant to use again given the price even with the courteous service.  I discounted the rating as a result.< /review>

In the middle of a heat Waze my A/C dies. Called the first ac company I found and I made the right call. I called around 4pm and Tom was here around 5. He found the issues right away gave me a quote a bit pricey but it was well worth it in the middle of a heat Wave  and my A/C was up and running in no time worth any price. . Thanks again Tom for being super knowledgeable and getting me up and running.</review>

Talked to several friends who had theirs replaced by plumbers for 300 to 350. Valve was 110 at home depot. Even if it was 200 through the plumbing service, that puts labor at a little over $200/hr.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1603121379245, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to provide us with some honest feedback, Stanley.

I feel that I was fortunate to meet Alex Cose of John Stevenson Plumbing and Heating.  He was able to diagnose a drain problem I have been experiencing for a few months.  Alex was the 3rd plumber to try to diagnose the problem.
Alex Cose was successful.  He used the process of elimination to analyze that my drain was actually part of a community drainage system.  Now I will not have to pay for a service that is actually not my responsibility.   The HOA is responsible which saves me money.  I plan to use John Stevenson Plumbing in the future. The office people are great to deal with and I’m impressed with Alex.   Thank you<//Text>

Requested an estimate to repair my gas furnace. Stevenson's was prompt and they sent a repairman out the next morning. The inspection was quick and provided a diagnosis of the problem (malfunctioning gas control valve). I subtracted one star from the review because I provided the furnace model number and history of the problem to the person on the phone but that was not related to the repairman. Also, since I had SDG&E come out and perform their free diagnosis, I suspected that the gas control valve was the problem and asked the person on the phone if the repairman would have a replacement for my model of furnace and the reply was "yes, our repair trucks are fully stocked". The actual repairman said that they do not carry control valves and that the part would have to be ordered. Also, the total estimated repair cost of over $1200 (which included installing a sediment trap) was enough to encourage me to replace the valve myself!< /review>

We were quoted around $8,000 for services far and beyond what we asked for.  The individual walked through the house telling me how poor the quality is of all items in our three year old home including toilets, sinks, disposals, water tank, hot water heater, etc.
Jarod have me misinformation about items and told me that I should replace several things in my 3-year old home.
We ended up doing the service we called for on our own and in total spent around $60. Further, we cleaned the very parts thy Jarod said were not able to be cleaned.
This individual clearly tried to take advantage of me which demonstrates a total lack of respect for me and your business.  I highly suggest evaluating the process and business philosophy and approach- experiences like this travel fast!</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Profession service from the initial estimate to the repair and replacement of parts to greatly improve water flow to shower and tub. I trust their integrity and expertise. Although it was higher priced than a private plumbers estimate, I chose them because I just knew that they would do it right, you get what you pay for. I’ve learned over time that it’s not worth it to cut corners or get the best price. I am glad that I hired them, Brice did an excellent job, and answered all of my questions. I will call them again for future plumbing needs particularly if complicated as this situation was. Very happy with their service, and no, they did not offer me anything of value to leave this review, I just appreciated their excellent and professional care.<//Review>< Pics>

The technician , Pedro, arrived on time & Proceed need to examine my hot water heater. He explained to me the repairs that needed to be made, he did a full review of the heater and that sat down with me and gave me alternatives to either repair or replace the heater. He was clear and concise and I didn’t need to be a extra to understand his explanation. My experience with Pedro was professional, yet friendly and very knowledgeable. After he completed the job I had a sense that my problem was resolved
This a new review for Armando for my yearly plumbing maintenance. In addition to checking my hot water heater for maintenance, Armando also checked all my plumbing&  water pressure. I received a very informational and much needed feedback from Armando about the status of the plumbing in my home.

I have to tell you my experience with Armando was absolutely wonderful. He was professional, knowledgeable and explained  things to me in a language that I understood and not in” plumbing” language.
In addition he made this a stress-free experience, he has a very engaging and friendly manner in addition to his professional skills. This is the type of employee that every company should have to service the public. Armando knows the true meaning of customer service. I would highly recommend this company and certainly Armando to be your plumber</Text>

<Text>We needed a hose replacement for a handheld shower, and the technicians from John Stevenson told us that the part was not available, and that they would need to make a hole in the wall to install a new elbow in order to replace the hose. The bid was over $500 (not including repairing the drywall). They also indicated that the new part wouldn't match the other parts of the shower, so they gave me additional bids for the rest of the trim kit, and those bids ranged up to  $2000. I thought that was pretty steep, so we had another plumber come, who instantly recognized the part. He had the part the next day and installed it for $40 plus the service call. It seems to me these guys are all about upselling. Beware!<//Text>< Pics>

First off, the technician was extremely friendly, polite and very upfront. I want to make it clear that the technician was great, no issues there whatsoever.  5 Stars!!

BUT.....my only complaint is paying $90 for literally 5 minutes of evaluation. Apparently I need to get into diagnosis business and subcontract it out. At that rate of time and money, you could theoretically make $270 an hour (minus gas money and travel time of course).  Unreal.  Minus a star for being expensive AF.  My time is definitely worth the quoted $841 to swap a part out.<//Text>

Compressor dead and another part replaced. Paid for parts, labor and he cleaned out the unit. Technician was professional and knowledgeable. Super glad we got it taken care of before the real heat expected the next few days!

Jordan very nice and helpful and did the job quickly. I was given an arrival time of 12-4 pm, but plumber arrived at 4:45. They did call twice to keep me updated, however.  The prices were kind of high for a simple clogged drain.  The appointment setter needs to be a little more honest about the pricing.  I was quoted 89 for a service call, which would be applied to the work, and she said just one clogged drain wouldn't be much more than that.  It was $270 altogether.</Text>

<Review>I'm not usually one to put reviews out there.  But, I just had to since I am so impressed.  This is a shout out to Jordan.

I recently had another plumbing contractor come out from a different company and tell me I need to replace the sewer pipe since it was cracked.  This was going to set me back about $5k.  Long story short, something just seemed off about this guy and the whole situation.  There was too much bragging and story-telling.  So, I got a 2nd opinion and Jordan came out on time with a smile and gave me the real story.  No new pipe needed.  Just break up the concrete a little bit around the pipe so that it has some wiggle room.

I just moved into this house a few months ago and need to tune up a few things around here.  Let's just say that John Stevenson will be my go-to for ALL things plumbing...heating...& A/C in the future.

< review>
My tank hot water heater ran it’s course.  I decided to go with a tankless unit - it was a somewhat complex retrofit. The Stevenson team provided many options as to potential solutions. Long and short is that I was very impressed with all of the solutions that were presented to me. I was super impressed with both the diagnosis associate, David, and the install team: Bryce, Blaise and Jon. They were all very knowledgeable and professional, and the work product is fantastic. 👍  Household capital expenditures suck, but John Stevenson and crew provided me some comfort this was money well spent. You get what you pay for...quality.< /review>

<text>Technician was very professional and friendly.   Would use him again.  Dispatch personnel were terrible.  Try keeping your customer informed.  Asked me to wait from 08 to 12 in the morning and technician arrived at 1:45 PM.  At least pretend that my time is important too.
Pricing expensive.  $450 to install a hard start AC capacitor.....about 30 minute job.< /text><Rating>3<//Rating><date>1598051806538<//date>< user_name>

Brian, Eric, Ryan & Nacho are awesome. They are friendly, professional, and hard working. They removed my old system and put in a new one in two days. They left the house as clean as they found it, they showed me the in and outs of using and maintaining the system. Great experience all

Great deal for a tune-up / inspection. Got some good advice and an overall good service. He didn't think it was necessary to fo into attic and inspect that part of the system. There were a few other things i feel like he could have checked also.. that's the only reason it's not 5 stars</review>

<text>The technicians were very polite and professional, the work great.  They took care of the leak with no issue.  It was the price, a three hour plumbing fix shouldn’t cost as much as a  major transmission repair, although the work was great, I’ll neither call them again nor recommend them to family or friends.< /text></record>

When we spoke over the phone, we agreed that one of our technicians would be able to service your sink's reverse osmosis system. After he arrived and did an evaluation of the system, he informed you that we would have to order various parts for that particular repair. He then mentioned that we do offer a whole-home filtration system, which would have filtered water running throughout all of your household faucets and fixtures. We were happy to help, but needed additional parts to service the sink and our technician believed installing a whole-home filtration system would be in your best interest. If you have any additional questions or concerns, feel free to contact our office. Thank you for your feedback and have a great day!"}<//response>< review>
CUSTOMER BEWARE...The reason for the 1 star is that the technician was very polite, professional.  The reason it’s only one star is that they were provided the name of our reverse osmosis system, said they could assist, so we felt ok with it.  THEN, the tech arrived, said they couldn’t service it and then proceeded to sell us on a whole home system, as well as other services they provide.  AND THEN CHARGED US FOR THE VISIT.  They did note that the visit would incur a charge, but when we provided the name of the system prior to the tech visit and our need they claimed they can help, so we felt comfortable scheduling the service.  Totally false pretense. BEWARE.</review>

Cannot say enough good things and appreciation for the whole team when my water heater started leaking; way overdue for replacement.

I really appreciated the local family-owned, really super efforts to do the replacement the same day.  About 6 hours of effort; one removing and preparing everything for the really talented guy that was on another big job that came to do the replacement and final work.

Thanks to all of you for a really fantastic job.

<Text>John Stevenson plumbing was an answer to prayer.  Tuesday night our water heater quit working! 8:00 pm, in the middle of the covid 19!  I called this amazing company, sorry I don't remember the sweet young lady answering the phone, who said we would be serviced the next day.  Asked all the safety health questions, and Ryan arrived the next morning 8:30am.  Ryan was masked, gloved, and as we are seniors, appreciated the social distancing.  Answered all our questions, gave us great advice,  had Mike and Dave here following  all safety guideline within an hour . Fast,  efficient, polite and as they had to remove and replace the dryer to install the water heater,. No problem for them!  My husband and I could not have been more pleased and would highly recommend this company!  Thank you John Stevenson and company.   Be blessed</Text>< Gmap_id>

Best experience ever!!! Ask for Michael Dane he is absolutely the very BEST.  Michael patiently explained every question I threw his way.  He was well  mannered, detailed, completely fixed the problem and cleaned up better than when he started. John Stevenson Plumbing Heating & Air was very reasonable and would highly recommend this company. Was very impressed with the company and Michael Dane. Thank you!!!< /text>

Needed a plumber to replace my washing machine water valves before a new machine could be installed.
Ryan Solis from John Stevenson Plumber’s came out. He did superb work. Fast and efficient but more than that he was honest and friendly. Made me feel like I had been a client of her s for years. Not a customer he just met. I will use this company again and again and tell my friends who own homes also about them Because of Ryan!!</text>

I was surprised how reasonable their pricing was knowing that plumbing can be an expensive service to ask for.

Tom is amazing! He cleaned my heater saving me energy costs and even repaired my neighbor's old A/C unit. And he did all of this quickly and efficiently. He called before he arrived and arrived exactly when he said he would. I'm very impressed with the service of this company, so much so that I bought their service check program where they periodically come out and inspect my air, plumbing and heating for a very low monthly fee. Makes sense to me.<//Text>

Our company only offers upfront, flat-rate pricing and we did perform a diagnostic check for your water heater for $39. We also presented to you multiple pricing options for a water heater repair or installation, but explained that replacing your entire water heater would be the best option since any repairs to the unit would just be a temporary fix. We also explained that the repair we offered for $223 will not solve all of your water heater issues but you still insisted we go through with the repair. We understand that our pricing doesn't meet all of our clients needs, however we did our best to inform you that replacing your unit would be the best solution. If you have any additional questions or concerns, feel free to contact our office. Have a great day."}<//Response>< gmapID>

<Text>Mike came out within 2hr time frame. He was super friendly and professional. He explained the process and what equipment he was using and for what purpose. He tried two different size snakes, the bigger one was able to unclog whatever was in the pipe. What Mike doesn't know is that I had called another plumber earlier in the day and he was not able to unclog the drains. The other company claimed that I needed to dig up the pipes for repair,  that it's not an easily fixed issue ($4200). Always get a second opinion! So thankful I found an honest company. I'll be recommending this company to everyone I know. Thank you Mike!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

We recently had a roof that leaked which originally presented itself by a leak from the A/C Duct.  I called John Stevenson Plumbing and let them know there was a leak in my duct and they sent someone out immediately.  Carter arrived in a timely manner and confirmed that the leak wasn't from the duct and said it was from our roof.  He even went into our attic to confirm the leak was from the roof and took pictures and video which was helpful for our insurance claim.

We then decided to have a toilet installed and some duct work done since the furnace had to be removed. Everyone who worked on that project (Armando, Brian, Ryan, Nate and John) were all extremely professional and did a great job!  I cannot recommend John Stevenson Plumbing enough.  They always go above and beyond in their service.</Text>

<text>Although they advertise a drain cleaning for $79 on the web, they came and wanted to do a job for almost $ 600 - but not just clean the AC drain, what we asked for. That drain did apparently not fall under the offer... Plus they didn' t mention the $ 89 fee for just coming out for inspection. Not recommended.</text></record></dataset><record>

David came to fix a faucet that was not delivering cold water.  He determined the problem immediately and fixed it.  He was so professional and courteous (wore booties in the house).  After the repair, he reviewed an inexpensive solution to removing all the contaminants from the entire water system of my home.  He never pressured me but provided a great education on whole house water treatment systems.<//Review>

Our technicians choose to give our customers options based on their specific plumbing issues, which is why we require an in-person evaluation rather than providing any "ballpark" pricing over the phone. In most cases, over-the-phone estimates are inaccurate, especially since a technician isn\'t able to thoroughly inspect a customer\'s home system and develop a correct diagnosis.

So here's how they do business.  On a clogged shower - they wanted $90 to come out and inspect.  Not a problem - I wasn't interested.  They called me back and said they'd come out and inspect it for $30 and give me a bid.

I asked what the normal price for a shower clog was - they couldn't say.  I asked - just give me a ballpark.  They still couldn't say.

So I fell for it and had them come out for $30 to give me a bid.  The guy was quick to come out - which was nice, but the $244 bid to unclog a shallow shower clog was way too high.

I especially dislike their method of not disclosing any prices until after they are on the premises and you're already in to them for a few bucks.

I'd rather pay someone else who can give me a number up front - instead of the somewhat slimey methods they use.</review>

<Review>I had a great experience with your company. Joseph Wood was our assigned agent. He was very professional, knowledgeable and quickly identified our problem. Although the problem was rather minor, he explained it thoroughly while making the appropriate fix. And all for a decent price. A not normally communicated element to my confidence in Joseph was how clean and organized his truck was! I have not plumbing skill, but can feel more or less confident is someone who keeps his workspace tight and orderly. Cudos to him for that!!  I will definitely use you again.<//Review><UserId.>109161877307146260392<//UserId.>< Response>

Pedro was great and was able to clean up my current AC enough to make sure it will keep humming through the summer. It is very old, so he suggested I look at what it would take to get a new system vs. pouring a bunch of money into a 27 year old unit.

These people are amazing and wonderful.  At 5:00 p.m. on a Friday before the Labor Day weekend, our air conditioning went out.  It was hot and we have a week-old baby in the house.  I called my usual service company and got a recording.  Based on their Google review, I called John Stevenson Plumbing, Heating & Air.  Not only did I get a live person (she was sympathetic and understanding -- a young mother herself), I got an immediate response.  Within 15 minutes, I got a call from Juan explaining that the tech had one call before ours but would be there within two hours.  True to his word, their tech, Pedro, showed up at 7:00 p.m.  Not only did he fix the air conditioning, he made several helpful suggestions on how to avoid problems in the future.  He was skilled, professional and very kind.

I am beyond grateful to these people.  My experience with John Stevenson Plumbing, Heating & Air was everything a homeowner could want: responsive, respectful and reasonably priced.  They are now my "go-to guys".  I recommend them wholeheartedly.< /review>

The two men that replaced a copper plumbing pipe for my mobile home were very professional and concerned. It was a very hot day but they  pushed through and explained what they did.  I was told I may need a new water heater soon, and I also have some issues with other piping serving my little home.  I appreciated their input and information.  My leak seems corrected now and I am thankful.  Thank you.<//text>

<user_id>114229103423786876485< /user_id><user_name>Bree Barker</user_name><review>Nice tech.  I really liked him, but he didn't identify the problem correctly.  That being said, I paid the $79, but still had a clogged sink.  However, I was given proposals ranging from $355 to $1800 to take care of the problem, which was not identified.  I was told I needed to have the latter work done.  Before I would allow that, I called for a second opinion.  The other plumber came, quickly assessed the problem and I had the clog resolved in less than an hour at a reasonable price.  Would have been even better if I hadn't had to pay Stevenson $79 for nothing.  Stevenson's tech had everything wrong from the direction the pipes flowed out to the sewer and work needed to correct it.  What really compounds this issue is that the tech was out 3 different times.  I had to live with a plugged sink for several days.  Nice people but perhaps more training is needed</review>< Pics>

My interaction with J Stevenson Plumbing is primarily with their technician Pedro.
Pedro discovered during an inspection that the two furnaces that were < 2 yrs. old had defective  parts and he notified his company that these should be covered under warranty. He promised to return and repair the units.
Pedro also showed me the least expensive approach to cover support costs.<//Text>

< review>
The first appointment kept being delayed to the point that I had to reschedule. The technician was very nice but quoted me $1180 to clean the outside drains using hydrojet. He then told me if I could get a neighbor to also use the service on the same day, the price would be $800 each. He told me the price was set by the industry. I called around and ended up getting the same service from another company for $375 which included a free camera inspection.< /review>

Pedro was very conscientious and polite while examining the condition of my furnace. He presented options to make the unit more efficient but ultimately it needs replacing because The unit is 26 years old. If I were ready to replace the unit, I would not hesitate to have John Stevenson company do it for me.< /review>

I had a faucet handle that broke off and some of the hoses were leaking. I called and asked for a technician to come out and change my faucet. The technician was really kind and informative but ended up looking at the water heater. Next thing I know he is trying to sell me a new water heater and a membership service.

He ended up doing a temporary fix and told me after being at my home for an hour that he didn’t have time to actually repair my faucet and that he would return Monday to fix it. 2 hours later I was showing someone what was done and come to find out the hoses were still leaking.

After a couple YouTube videos I figured out how to fix the issue myself and now the company wants me to pay the diagnostic fee. I offered to pay half since the job was not complete and the technician technically didn’t even temporarily fix the problem.  Jose is extremely rude and likes to threaten your credit and everything else he can. But this is strictly about trying to up sell. It’s an unfortunate situation but I would think that a unsatisfied customer offering to pay half would be something the company would be happy with considering my water pressure also went down after the technician was at my home.< /text>

They installed a new water heater a year ago at my daughter’s condo, and called to schedule a one year checkup. At the same time we scheduled a furnace check up. 2 separate technicians came, both were great and helpful. The heating tech showed us a few minor things that were issues, but suggested waiting until the unit dies( it is 19yrs old) rather than spending $$$ to fix minor issues. The honesty is greatly appreciated.
I will definitely recommend them to friends, and will use them at my house as well.< /review>

Last September 2018 I moved into my new home in Carlsbad.   I needed to accomplish some major upgrades including installing air conditioning, a tankless water heater and a gas line for my new gas range.   After meeting with the representatives from John Stevenson I chose them to do the work.   This year I needed to replace the heating system due to its age and needed repairs.    From my first meeting and all subsequent work performed by the company’s staff I am very impressed with their level of professionalism, quality of work, friendliness, patience and above all, their helpfulness!    It’s a comfort to know they are so trustworthy as I am a 73 year old senior citizen!

The wonderful staff included Carter, Andrew, Joe, Alex and Tom!</Text>

They were fast and professional however their prices are significantly higher than all the other plumbers in Carlsbad. I would never have had them come out and waste $39 for a quote if i had known they were going to quote me double the next highest plumber. $2,900 to replace a 40 gallon water heater is absurd.  Only use them if you are stuck and have no other options. Nice people though.</Review>

Our technician, Alex was very helpful and courteous.  He contacted me almost immediately after talking to the answering service. He arrived within the time he had specified..  That was greatly appreciated. He's wonderful.
The only negative would have been the price charged, $511.00.  I could understand the $189 because it was on a Sunday but the remaining cost seemed way too high for 20 minutes of work.  But I guess that's the going rate for plumbing these days...
If I had time I would have compared prices with other companies..<//Text>

We had our Water Heater go out over the Fourth of July weekend.

After determining that it was still under warranty we had to go through a few extra steps to get a replacement. Joe, the Field Supervisor took extraordinary measures to get us back up and running by mid-day on Saturday.

Joe was professional, courteous and efficient. He went that “extra mile” and it was greatly appreciated.

We won’t hesitate to use them again and recommend John Stevenson Plumbing to our family and friends!

<Text>Two very capable and professional men arrived on time and worked on seven different plumbing issues I had as I ready my home to sell. They arrived early and worked until 4:00pm with a half hour break to get some lunch (at my urging). The faucets, garbage disposal, shower heads, valves and all parts and pieces of my plumbing are perfect now. And, they cleaned up after themselves better than I do...including vacuuming.</Text>< username>

The technician was very polite and quick to diagnose the issue. He was also prepared to fix it promptly. Over all great experience. And his teeth were sparkling white. 😁 My only complaint would be that it took 4 days to get to me but they were the fastest of all the places I called. (Busy time of year for these guys.)<//text>

< Review>
First, I located John Stevenson plumbing online and found that they had very reasonable rates.  Setting up an appointment was a breeze and I was given a 2 hr time window, 30 minutes from the time I called (perfect!).  They then phoned me when the specialist was 30 minutes away.  Jason arrived exactly on time, neat and clean with a great attitude.  He got to work immediately and unclogged my kitchen drain.  Then, per my request, he scoped the pipe with camera and explained to me what the condition of the pipe was.  I'm an engineer and I love to talk tech - which can be a bit much for some people.  Jason listened attentively and helped me understand more about my plumbing.  I really appreciate that.  I will definitely use John Stevenson again and I will recommend this company (and Jason!) to my neighbors.  Keep up the great work and thanks again!< /Review>

First of all, I'm not dissatisfied with the repair job that was performed. I am not happy with the flat rate charge that I paid. I showed the technician where the leak was and had the area exposed for ease of repair. The job entailed replacing two feet of copper pipe and adding two couplers. The same type of repair was done about a week ago, but was under the mobile home. The repair tech had to find the leak and do the repair in some muddy area. That job cost me about $130. Granted that the second repair was done on a Saturday and I expected to pay a weekend rate, but not $503. Well,  I should be more careful who I contract with.< /review>

This company responded so quickly to my call and had someone out to my home in a few hours.  The young man who showed up was polite, professional  and prompt with giving us a reasonable quote and made the necessary changes to have my air conditioner up and running again.

We would recommend this company and use them again.  Thank you so much.

We had a water leak. Ryan came and diagnosed the problem quickly with minimum intrusion into the walls. A slab leak was the problem. We scheduled an entire house hot and cold water line replacement that started the next day. Everyone with John Stevenson was very professional and upfront.< /Review>

< review>
It is with great pleasure that we write these words to let everyone know how impressed we are with the services of John Stevenson Heating and plumbing. We installed three indoor mini splits and a heat pump on the roof. Mr Brian Shockley has been extremely professional, courteous, punctual and attentive to all details and needs. The installation was complicated and Brian took care of every detail. The equipment is very quiet, the electric cables are perfectly organized and tidy.  We are pleased having nice cool air and heating when we need it. Thanks Brian for your knowledge and your work ethic. Our experience with John Stevenson and Brian has been beyond our expectations. I would recommend John Stevenson to anyone in the city that needs heating, cooling and plumbing services. I look forward to having your company service our equipment when need it. Again thanks, RObert and Gina Ing< /review>

I can't even give them one star!  I called  John Stevenson plumbing to have someone come out and add a blower to our fireplace.  When I called in the women on the phone said let me make sure we provide that service, when she got back on the phone she said YES we do provide that service and when would you like to schedule.  I set the appointment for 3 weeks out.  TODAY I GET A CALL, THEY  ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OUT TOMORROW AND THEY CALL ME TELLING ME THEY CAN'T MAKE IT THEY HAVE AN ALL DAY JOB today and it will run into tomorrow and wanted to reschedule for next week.  When I told Juan NEXT WEEK DOESN'T WORK FOR ME. he said "well you know I don't even know if we do that kind of service" WHAT LET'S SEE YOU WANTED TO RESCHEDULE AND THEN YOU SAY AFTER I CAN'T RESCHEDULE YOU SAY OH WE DON'T DO THIS  SERVICE! WHAT IS IT? And remember this is after the girl on the phone double checked to make sure they provide the service.  GOOD LUCK IF YOU CHOOSE THEM TO DO ANYTHING CHANCES ARE THEY WON'T SHOW!  i WOULD OF GIVEN THEM A FEW STARS HAD THEY GIVE ME ANY KIND OF NOTICE! WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.. CALL SOMEONE ELSE!<//review>

Pedro came out to do a air conditioner check up and he also reviewed the furnace and made sure both were in good repair. He had a long term recommendation and explained what I need to do and why when I replaced the furnace but he didn't try and sell me a new system since mine is still in good shape even after 19 years. I feel like I can trust their recommendations to be best for me as the customer not what makes them.the most money. Thank you for your honesty.</Review>

<time>1564190735479</time><Review>Great company.  My A/C was out yesterday, called them the next am and the repair person was out that same day.  Heat wave in San Diego.  I was surprised by the very quick service, because all the A/C guys are very busy right now.

Found a short in a wire and fixed it immediately.  The unit is 20 years old.

My previous experience with this company was also positive.  They repaired 2 twenty year old high-end Jado shower valves that 2 other plumbers told us could not be repaired.

In the past, they also cleaned out our outside and inside A/C units including filters at reasonable cost.< /Review>< rating>

This is the best service experience I think i have ever had.  Alex the plumber who came out was thorough, helpful and knowledgeable.   The value has been extensive and I am very pleased.  The answering service had told me I was out of their service area but Alex called back and said he could come over right away.  Awesome</Review>

<Text>Thank you for taking care of us and repairing our AC unit.  The company was prompt to send out a technician and let me know who would be arriving and at exactly what time so I would not have to waste half a day waiting.  The problem was diagnosed quickly by Thomas and he even kindly waited for me as I made a last ditch effort to call the manufacturer about any warranties.  Cost to fix was higher than I’d like but it includes service 3 times during the year for heating or other air units.  I especially liked how the company sent a pic and bio of the technician doing the service so I know a little about who I’m letting inside the house.  Thank you for being professional and working quickly to resolve and repair the problem.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

The office staff and technicians were all courteous, helpful and professional. Travis eased my worries with a correct diagnosis of  the problem at my elderly mother’s home over the phone on the weekend. Ryan confirmed the problem on Monday and completed the necessary repairs with great efficiency, keeping me apprised of the work by phone throughout. If it weren’t for some glitches with scheduling, this would have been a 5-star review. I will definitely use them again!< /Review>

Hired them to do a full HVAC replacement including duct work...Brian did a great job specifying exactly what units and duct rework we needed and did not try to sell me anything I didn't need...the installation crew of Tyler, Andrew and Nick did an amazing job removing the old stuff and installing a new furnace, new a/c unit and new duct work that is now 100 times better than what I had up in my attic for the last 15 years!  Brian and the crew were all extremely knowledgeable about the products they were installing and what they needed to do to make temperature control in my 2250 sq.ft. ranch style house more comfortable and efficient without a complicated system.  Very impressed with the quality of work these guys did especially in the running and the installation of the new duct work.  I think John Stevenson pricing is fair, and although not cheap, a good value because in working with contractors I believe you get what you pay for and if I'm happy with the work it's always money well spent.  I have also used this local Carlsbad company for a plumbing repair in the past and was very satisfied with the work for that as well.  I found all the staff I came in contact with from the appointment scheduler Peg and everyone who answered their phones to the installation crew all very professional and responsive people who seem to really care about their company and their customers.  As a homeowner of an older home it's nice to have a go to company for plumbing, heating and air concerns!</review>

<Review>My 34-year old central AC unit was declared dead last Thursday. It’s Friday and I’m the proud owner of 2 Fujitsu Compressors and 5 mini-splits. Plus, they ripped out the old system. Tyler, Carter, Nate, Ryan and Nacho were fantastic.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Had a water leak and after calling around, John Stevenson plumbing was the only one who could get to me immediately; which I needed because I was leaving town in 7 hours. Ryan Solis came out and couldn’t have been more professional, polite and personable while still doing a very thorough repair job. It wasn’t cheap but the work was done quickly and efficiently to get our household back in business. Peg, who was my initial contact point, was super nice as well and made sure someone got to my house quickly and followed up to let me know Ryan was on the way.</text>< pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Hired them to do a full HVAC replacement including duct work...Brian did a great job specifying exactly what units and duct rework we needed and did not try to sell me anything I didn't need...the installation crew of Tyler, Andrew and Nick did an amazing job removing the old stuff and installing a new furnace, new a/c unit and new duct work that is now 100 times better than what I had up in my attic for the last 15 years!  Brian and the crew were all extremely knowledgeable about the products they were installing and what they needed to do to make temperature control in my 2250 sq.ft. ranch style house more comfortable and efficient without a complicated system.  Very impressed with the quality of work these guys did especially in the running and the installation of the new duct work.  I think John Stevenson pricing is fair, and although not cheap, a good value because in working with contractors I believe you get what you pay for and if I'm happy with the work it's always money well spent.  I have also used this local Carlsbad company for a plumbing repair in the past and was very satisfied with the work for that as well.  I found all the staff I came in contact with from the appointment scheduler Peg and everyone who answered their phones to the installation crew all very professional and responsive people who seem to really care about their company and their customers.  As a homeowner of an older home it's nice to have a go to company for plumbing, heating and air concerns!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1579120495533, 'text': 'Good Afternoon Barbara,\n\nWow what a stunning review!

Expectations Exceeded! This was my first time needing plumbing services as a home owner and I was a bit apprehensive to start the process. David came over to address the problem the day I called, was very professional, educated me about the process and gave me options. I appreciate their use of technology to make the process efficient. Peg was also very friendly and professional taking my initial call. I would highly recommend John Stevenson Plumbing and will definitely be using them again for any future needs.< /review>

<text>JOE WOOD Came out and greeted me with a handshake and a smile.  Very professional, honest, and thorough.  He quickly diagnosed the water heater problem and patiently talked about several options from tank-less to traditional 40g tank.
JOE was honest about both options and didn't try to push us toward a specific option. He assured us that either choice would satisfy our water needs.
Once the work started JOE flowed smoothly through the process and talked to me about what he was doing and why he was doing it.  His knowledge of the trade will put you at ease as you will know a PROFESSIONAL is doing the work as apposed to your "friend who knows a guy."
When the work was done JOE explained everything he did and why he did it.
He left with a handshake and a smile.  Very professional and a great representative of the company.

Very pleased with the service received from Jeremiah with John Stevenson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  Jeremiah performed initial services to address a broken shower valve and provided several alternatives that would provide more permanent fix.  Upon selection of preferred alternative, he assisted with ordering of needed parts and scheduling or additional repairs.<//text>

The whole team was friendly, prompt, professional, and communicated well. Whole process was about as smooth as could hope for.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Expectations Exceeded! This was my first time needing plumbing services as a home owner and I was a bit apprehensive to start the process. David came over to address the problem the day I called, was very professional, educated me about the process and gave me options. I appreciate their use of technology to make the process efficient. Peg was also very friendly and professional taking my initial call. I would highly recommend John Stevenson Plumbing and will definitely be using them again for any future needs.< /Text><response>{'time': 1563816940733, 'text': 'Good Morning Kimberly,\n\nWe are thrilled to hear that we exceeded your expectations with the service we provided.

My toilets tank stopped receiving water and I decided to call a couple places to see what it would be to have it looked at. This place was the first one I called.

They said for $89 they could come out and diagnose the problem and give me an estimate on what it would be to fix it. While I was on the phone with them I found a couple other options for $50 to come out and do the same thing, so I told them thanks, I will think about it and give them a call back. The lady on the phone then told me hold on, let me talk to the manager and I can get that $89 service fee waived, and so I just went ahead and decided to use them.

The guy who came out was great, nice professional etc. He took a look at my toilet and was able to tell me the problem was my corroded shut off valve stopping the water flow and he did this by connecting a feeder hose to see if water was still flowing just somehow being blocked by the valve. He was quick to diagnose the problem and clear on what it was.
Then I asked for an estimate for this repair. It was $400 - the $89 dollar service fee credit which goes toward the repair so it brought my grand total to $311. That price was absolutely outrageous. The part was a $12 dollar part from home depot. All you need is a wrench to remove and replace it. For me to shut off my water, and remove/replace this piece took me 10 minutes. There isnt anything special involved or any fancy special tools required to do this. It was as simple as unscrewing something and screwing the new one on (and shutting off the water before doing this) It is not rocket science. I have no experience with plumbing and I did it myself.

Anyway the 1 start review is because of the insane pricing. $400 for coming over and replacing a 10$ piece? The labor doesn't even take 20 minutes.

Anyway, I told the guy I was just going to fix it myself because $400 is a bit much unless you could bring the price down. He was firm on the pricing, and said its set by management at most he could call and ask but he knows they wont change it so I went ahead and ended up paying the $89 service fee and that was that.

What confuses me is he could of just knocked like 100 off the price and it would of still been outrageous but I'd of done it. I don't know anyone who wouldn't be happy to make over $200 just to screw some part on. As long as its not totally obscence pricing I'd go with it, but less then 20 minutes of basic labor and screwing on a part that costs 12$ at home depot that they carry for $400 is their normal pricing? You'd have to be a complete idiot to go with that.</Text>

We had some nasty backed up drains that needed clearing so we called this company because we had called them in an emergency last year and had been very satisfied with their prompt services the last time. Unfortunately we didn’t take the time to give them a positive review the last time so we thought we’d try them again. Well it wasn’t a fluke folks. This time around Jason P. came out and starting with the booties he put on at the door, to the clear estimates, and the respectful way he spoke to both my elderly mother and me made it a pleasure having him in our home. We will definitely using them on future projects.< /Text>

<Review>I am recovering from surgery and my husband is disabled. I can't thank the Stevenson's team enough for their friendly service and expertise.  We had originally had an appointment which I had to cancel because of a death in my family.  We ended up buying a refrigerator but discovered the water line had a major leak. I called them and spoke with Kate (who was very helpful and friendly) and she was able to send Alex to at least turn off the water. Joe & Jeremiah showed up a short while later and went above and beyond - reworking the connections so they were correct.  I won't use anyone other that John Stevenson's to work on my house! Thanks so much guys.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Just had a plumbing consult from Travis, and he was wonderful! He was quick, efficient, knowledgeable, and pointed out a couple VERY important issues with our sinks/water heater. Super friendly and helped “dumb down” the plumbing talk so I could understand what needed to be done. There was no pressure at the end of the consult to purchase any products, but we will definitely be calling them to do our replacements! Such a great company, and I would highly recommend requesting Travis as your consult technician.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Showed up on time, spent almost two hours checking. Then tried to sell me more ducting, air returns and ultimately $399. for coolant. The problem wasn't fixed and I called in another company. The problem was an incorrectly scheduled nest thermostat.
It took five minutes to reprogram.  When the unit turned itself off and then started fine twenty minutes later the thermostat should have been checked.
This was very unprofessional and poorly executed.< /text>< Pics>

Ryan was extremely professional and helpful through a difficult tub and toilet install. Two shower valves were also installed perfectly. The solder joints and final outcome are beyond what I have expected .He asked questions and listened to my needs and concerns. The company followed up and communicated extremely well. They were upfront and handled ALL details and unexpected issues immediately. Very impressed, would use John Stevenson Plumbing again.<//Text>

<review>Alex Cose came by and unclogged my drains. He was super professional and extremely knowledgeable about everything. Had my backed sewage cleared out in recorded breaking speeds, all the while answering any and every question I had.  Told me the best ways to prevent myself from walking in my own fecal matter and how to keep everything flowing smoothly. Will definitely recommend him to family, friends and anybody that needs a professional plumber!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>John Stevenson Plumbing was the second plumber I called. First, I tried our regular plumber, but they wanted to charge me their "after-hours" rate at 3:30 in the afternoon and couldn't get anyone here for at least 2 hours. Forget that! I had an active leak I couldn't stop.

When I called JSP, they not only said they would be charging their daytime prices, but they don't charge by the hour--they charge by the job, by what actually needs to be done. Refreshing! Then they had a plumber here in less than 30 minutes, and he was the Field Supervisor, no less.

He was friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. He gave me an estimate, including a new-client discount of about 10%, and explained what he was going to do. We had a whole new pressure regulator and shutoff valve in about an hour! He cleaned up the space, gave us some helpful recommendations for avoiding future leaks, a quick tutorial on turning off the water at the street (which I couldn't figure out how to do before), how to bleed air out of the water lines, and was on his way.

Highly recommended!<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
We had some nasty backed up drains that needed clearing so we called this company because we had called them in an emergency last year and had been very satisfied with their prompt services the last time. Unfortunately we didn’t take the time to give them a positive review the last time so we thought we’d try them again. Well it wasn’t a fluke folks. This time around Jason P. came out and starting with the booties he put on at the door, to the clear estimates, and the respectful way he spoke to both my elderly mother and me made it a pleasure having him in our home. We will definitely using them on future projects.<//Review>

I always call John Stevenson Plumbing when I need something done.  They are responsive, courteous and always do a great job.  I've had Joe come out a few times and he always does a great job and stays late in order to make sure everything is perfect.  Glad to have found this company and I appreciate their service.< /Text>

<Review>Jordan was quick to help us locate, diagnose, & drain our backed up main valve. The blockage was resulting in 4 backed up toilets & 2 tubs in which he was able to address in a quick & professional manner. He was nothing short of a pleasure to work w/while communicating & breaking down in non plumber language that we could understand. Jordan definitely b our plumber of choice for all future plumbing issues.
Thank u so much for making our home disaster & bit less painful.

Alex from John Stevenson Plumbing just left my home after meticulously unstopping my kitchen sink. I am SO IMPRESSED by Alex's knowledge, professionalism and kindness.

He was prompt, efficient and hugely respectful of my home.

Alex Cose came by and unclogged my drains. He was super professional and extremely knowledgeable about everything. Had my backed sewage cleared out in recorded breaking speeds, all the while answering any and every question I had.  Told me the best ways to prevent myself from walking in my own fecal matter and how to keep everything flowing smoothly. Will definitely recommend him to family, friends and anybody that needs a professional plumber!</Text>

<date>1575676101658</date><rating>5<//rating><Text>John Stevenson Plumbing was a great find. I called bc my heater stopped working and had never had an HVAC service done before. They were extremely friendly and immediately offered me the $39 inspection, which for me made all the difference! It removes the barrier and worry associated with a potentially major service. Wishing 2 days, Brian, the technician came out and immediately identified the issue. He even offered to come back the next day, which was a Saturday, to install the new part. He was experienced and very professional and i now feel a high degree of trust and loyalty to Brian and John Stevenson Plumbing and Heating!
I would highly recommend this company and especially Brian. I am grateful for the great service all around! Robin Selitsch<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Home sewage drain was clogged.
John Stevenson Plumbing was able to place us on a high priority list to come out for inspection and repair.
Jason and Jordan (and Juan in the office) kept in constant contact with me through text to keep me informed about their scheduling and ETA.
Jason and Jordan were friendly, knowledgeable, quick, considerate, and had good advice to share.
They represented their company well and I am definitely leaning towards using John Stevenson Plumbing more.< /Text>

I have been a John Stevenson customer for over 4 years.  I use them for all my plumbing,  heating and air conditioning needs in addition to annual service checks on those systems.  Their service Technicians are knowledgeable and professional in actions and appearance.  I highly recommend John Stevenson Plumbing and I have done so with several of my neighbors.  Also, John Stevenson Plumbing has always arrived on time for my appointments.<//review>

I am very excited about my new tankless water heater system and Flow Tech water filtration/ anti scale installed by Joe at John Stevenson Plumbing.   The installation was done in one day with impeccable quality and work standards.  So long 75 gallons of hot water sitting in my garage.     I look forward to many years of clear water and efficient service from this product.  So wonderful to have the saved space in my garage and let go of the worry from a holding tank of water.   Thank you John Stevenson Plumbing, you have responded great to all my needs the past four years.</Text>

Couldn't write a better review! I called about a clogged toilet and Jason was at my house within an hour. And mind you this wasn't an emergency ;) He was polite, courteous, thorough, and knowledgeable. I would call Jason to come out again in a heartbeat. He is my go-to now :) Thanks for a great job Jason! Having a plumbing issue is, well, yucky and you made the experience easy! 5 - stars for John Stevenson Plumbing - Heating - Air
UPDATE 9-2018 called again for a kitchen drain issue. Jason was at my house within 1 hour of my call. Fixed the problem easily and quickly. 5 stars once again :)</Review>

Men came within a relatively short time after my call. They nicely called before arrival to give us an estimate for arrival.

Jason and Alex were very friendly. They were knowagable as they quickly diagnosed the problem and had it repaired shortly after.

Were are very grateful of their quick service and resolution of our problem. We will definitely call them again and can highly recommend them.</Review>

<Review>After trying to deal with a stubborn clog in my bathroom we called John Stevenson Plumbing.  Alex, the plumber, was polite, professional, courteous, and explained everything he was doing.  And he got the sink draining in record time, all for $79.  If the drain clogs again within 30 days, we get one free visit to re-snake the pipe.  I highly reccomend John Stevenson Plumbing!<//Review></record>

Ryan was an excellent technician. I was very pleased with the communication and explanations for all the work done.
To be Frank, I ended up paying far more than I originally anticipated but I felt very comfortable with the outcome. That typically doesn't happen when blindsided by extra cost. I will definitely use these guys again. And again, Ryan is a heckuva technician.< /Text>

I called in a panic at 3:15 concerning a leaky toilet all over the floor.  Someone was at my house within 30 minutes. He looked like an angel to me.
He went  right into the bathroom, diagnosed  the problem, fixed it, cleaned up his mess and was out the door within 40 minutes. The price was very reasonable.
I had already canceled a dinner get together with girlfriends. Boy were they  surprised when I walked in that restaurant right on time!</Text>

<rating>1< /rating><review>We were in a tough spot. Called for service for air and broken pipe and air condition service. My in-laws were at home to receive the service people. The plumbing work was not done very well and I believe it was VERY VERY expensive for the work they did.  My wife and I returned home to a hole in the wall (they did have to cut to get to the pipe) BUT---the hole was not cut well or evenly. The air condition is working, they said the overflow shuts down the thermostat... $600 bucks seems high for the issue?!!?</review>< Pics>

<resp>{'time': 1562346161654, 'text': 'Good Morning Jason,\n\nWe are disappointed to hear that you were unsatisfied with the work completed as well as our pricing. We pride ourselves on always providing our customers with a five star quality work/service and we are sad to hear that this was not what you feel you received. After looking into your account and the work that was completed we stated in the invoice that was sent to you we would need to cut an opening into the stucco, approximately a 6” square and would need to repair the broken section 1/2” copper pipe. We replaced about five inches of copper and added a new thread on your hose bib. No leaks were found after the work was completed and everything was intact. After diagnosing your AC unit, we found the unit to be off from an over flow from condensate drain lines being plugged. We cleared the lines and installed a secondary safety switch, the other safety switch was soaked from the over flow. We tested the lines after clearing to ensure that it drained as it should.\nWe understand that we are not the right company for everyone. We will never cut corners or take short cuts that could compromise the quality of our work. We cannot offer the same level of service our customers deserve and expect at the same rates as companies who are cheaper. We understand that we will not be a match for everyone, but our goal is to provide the best value for your money by giving the best service, upfront pricing, and quality of work, not to be the lowest priced company out there. We truly appreciate your feedback, please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nThank you,'}< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc735b0e021679:0x86970d1b99ed27fb<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was able to get ahold of someone right away who was polite and helpful, and forwarded my request to the service tech, who got back to me quickly. Service tech showed up promptly and on the same day I called. Tech was very helpful in reviewing options and recommendations. Answered his phone later in the day for my follow up questions. We'll be doing an AC condenser install in a couple days, but so far so good.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Alex and Mike cleared out all of our outdoor drainage system after 26 years of dirt, roots and rock build up. They were very knowledgeable, professional and extremely hard working. I didn’t think this was even possible after years contending with deep flooding around the house and one year seeping into the sunken living room. And no, insurance does not cover ground water damage to drywall and flooring. Very costly! We now have peace of mind for heavy rain. So grateful to this company.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Needed help with the faucet in our office kitchen.  Technician showed up on time, was very polite, didn't try to immediately sell me a new faucet like the first plumber did.  He did a little trouble shooting (something the other plumber didn't do) and then gave me the contact info for the manufacturer of the faucet so that I could request a replacement head.

When my water heater decided to spring a leak that same week, I call John Stevenson Plumbing for help.  Technician was at my house in about 1 hour, installed a new water heater and brought my 30 year old installation up to code.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Customer Service, Customer Service, all I can say is Customer Service from the first phone call through out the entire project. Yes, I paid a lot and I got a lot.
There is no price for “peace of mind” and ‘confidence in a job done right!”
I give 5 stars times 2.
I will recommend/refer business without hesitation.
I was between a rock and a hard spot didn’t know where to turn. I shopped local!
Once the immediate need was met I asked about another issue, could it be handled? Yes immediately on the same call.
Concerned about which credit card I would need to use, I inquired about financial program. Once again, no problem and 3 very reasonable choices to choose from.
Within 5 minutes I was notified by email approval for full amount and the program that worked for my budget.
I could not be more pleased. I have service regular service on the water treatment and tankless water heater. Everything was done professionally and with ‘joy’. Scott and his supervisor Joe were a team. I’m totally impressed.
Don’t mess around - shop a price or cut corners.. make the call. John Stevenson Plumbing!
Thanks Kim for handling my call at first and coordination of project thereafter. You were my first impression and it was caring quality service.
A very satisfied customer in Leucadia- Beacon Beach.</Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Time>

I called John Stevenson Plumbing this morning, 12/30/18, because the shut off valve for toilet snapped off.  Water started spraying the wall and new flooring.
The VERY professional answering service heard my sense of urgency, said they'd reach out to on call / duty technician, Ryan, and he'd call within the hour.  Ryan called me within 5 minutes, said he was almost finished with a job near by and be here within 20 minutes.

Ryan arrived, diagnosed the problem and replaced the valve within 15 minutes.
I'm new to the area so, not knowing my neighbors yet, had to rely on Google search for help.  I had called a few other 24/7 plumbing companies who didn't even have anyone on call.
Ryan & John Stevenson Plumbing will receive ALL of my business going forward.  I've scheduled them to come out this week during non-urgent hours to repair multiple plumbing issues.
Thank you so much Ryan / John Stevenson Plumbing,
Mary<//text>

Project: Re-plumb of entire home
Tech: Ryan Solis
Summary: Great company, did a fantastic job. Only word of advice is to do your homework and get multiple quotes prior to employing any contractor. It can only help. At the end of the day, they are running a business and will act as such, but they do so with professionalism and are always willing to listen and help.< /review>

HOWERVER, the great service and timeliness and estimate were put into jeopardy by the number of follow up emails that were sent to me. WHY so many why not put as multiple attachments into one email? Please this is a great way to miss information when so much is sent under so many different covers. Now, I enjoyed meeting and getting the work done so professionally. thank you.< /Text>

We called John Stevenson Plumbing because they are local and we always try to use our local businesses.  Your commercials with the black/white dog brought us to your company, so cute!

We were treated with such kindness from my first contact with your receptionist.  Set up an appointment for the next day with Travis.  He was professional but friendly and ordered the necessary parts and was back (right on time) to spend the next day installing.  He was courteous and mindful of not messing up our home.  He even made friends with our small pet so she would stop shaking.  ;)  Overall, was a pleasant experience and will definitely call your company when we need help with our air conditioning unit or any other plumbing needs.  You are lucky to have such caring employees.  THANK YOU!< /text>

Both Travis and Thomas were very polite and courteous.  Everything about their work was fully explained and my questions were answered. I particularly appreciated both men taking time at the beginning of the visits to greet my two small dogs and become acquainted so the dogs  wouldn't bark or worry about the two men working around the garage and outside.<//review>

Incredible service. I called and scheduled a same day appt. For a kitchen leak. When I arrived home to meet them my water heater had just burst. They pulled up and jumped into action! Saved me from a terrible mess, replaced the water heater and then fixed my kitchen issue. It was Friday night and they stayed until all was complete and working. Left everything spotless. This is my 2nd experience with John Stevenson Plumbing. They are the best!< /review>

<Review>I am sure everyone can relate that it’s Hard to find a professional that isn’t booked solid for weeks out or resets appointments or late when they finally get there. I called John Stevenson Plumbing based on some reviews I read on line and they had a professional there the next day. Early for the appointment I might add. Work complete to my satisfaction and on my way to finishing my project. Thank you Travis Durkee at John Stevenson Plumbing I know what call to make for future plumbing needs.< /Review>< Pics>

I have to say that I have used this company before, but feel very disappointed to recently learn that the information that I received from their service representative was incorrect.  I was told that my furnace was compromised and that I would need a brand new furnace for approximately $3500.  At the time of the service inspection, the service man showed me what he believed was rust or deterioration, so he unplugged my furnace and told me that I was in danger of having CO2 come into my house because of what he had found. He had shown me a red marking area inside one of the cylinders with a small flashlight explaining that the cavity had deteriorated.  After explaining to my husband later on the phone about this diagnosis, he found this hard to believe since we have had this company come before for yearly service to maintain our furnace and to prevent such thing from happening. My husband was perplexed since he felt  “why bother with the yearly service checks if the deterioration  was never mentioned previously or caught earlier?” So, we phoned another company who came  to perform their own inspection.  What they found was not rust nor deterioration, but conduit tape that was visible on the edge of the interior of the furnace.  They used a probe camera and looked inside and showed me personally what was there...  I could definitely see that this was not rust nor any peeling of the surface of the furnace nor deterioration as I had been led to believe. The new company checked for CO2 readings and found none! How does one mistake such a thing for rust or deterioration, and unplug the furnace, and say a new furnace is needed because the old furnace is compromised?  In my opinion, this was a bait tactic to scare us into buying a new furnace through them...or simply an unknowledgeable serviceman!  In any event, be aware!<//Review>

We take pride in the service we provide and, are disheartened to hear that you were unsatisfied. At the time of service, our technician performed a thorough inspection of your furnace.

Our customers safety and well being is our top priority, and because of this our the technician felt the best option at that time would be to replace the unit completely due to the potential dangers of this issue.

Travis came out to our home in RSF on the weekend and was extremely knowledgeable and helped us when we had a gas leak.  He went above and beyond and made sure to find the gas leak so that we could have heat and hot water.  Very pleasant, patient and took his time to explain the problem and solution to us.  Highly recommend!!<//text>

Don't bother scheduling with this company: they don't show up.  I missed a half day of work for an appointment that never happened.  They couldn't show up within a 4-hour window, then tried to put the onus back on me because I said showing up at 5:30 was too late for my family.  Terrible scheduling, terrible service.  Find another company.</text>

We had a recent experience with John Stevenson Plumbing and HVAC for HVAC repair during the hot summer months. I did not expect to locate a company online with such positive reviews regarding customer service so quickly. The team at John Stevenson dispatched (Juan) to our resident within one to two hours are professionally confirming our appointment. When the service technician showed up (Tom), he politely called to confirm his arrival. This was ideal since we have two little ones at home napping.

John’s customer service was exceptional. Open communication on the issue, presented resolutions on the spot and utilized their smart device (IPad) to efficiently choose the products needed to fix the issue. After install, they cleaned up right away and followed through with a phone call to check in on the experience.

I had additional questions and contact their operations manager, Destry. Understanding that during this season, customers can get impatient and needy to fix their problem, Destry a very high level of knowledge and customer service to answer my questions.

Overall, the experience was positive. As a home owner with not much knowledge on HVAC systems, I felt I could trust a company with 30+ years of experience. From understanding the immediate need to fix issues and implementation on problem solving, the team knew how to get it done. Top that off with excellent customer service, Destry’s team is the choice!< /review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I was fortunate to have found these guys during a plumbing disaster on Thanksgiving Day, 2016.  I called six different plumbers and these guys were the only one that called back. They fixed my problem quickly.  I was extremely grateful and called them again when my business had a disaster in 2017.  Travis came out and surveyed the problem and got right on a water heater replacement.  He was very professional, knowledgeable and efficient.  Problem, once again, SOLVED.  2018...my home is on the market, potential buyers are coming to see the place and there is NO hot water.  Travis comes to the rescue again.  Diagnoses the problem, obtains the materials needed to do the job and AGAIN saves the day with a replacement for my 14 year old water heater.  He did a GREAT job replacing the crazy plumbing setup that was there.  My neighbors had their done by Travis at the same time.  They were extremely pleased with his work and the outcome.  John Stevenson Plumbing and his guy Travis are the ONLY plumbers I'll ever call when I need a plumber.</review>< Pictures>

I had an emergency situation last night during a Christmas party at my home. I called around asking for quotes and estimated wait times. Everywhere was either to expensive or the wait was up to two hours. Travis called me back within 5 minutes, gave me a resonable quote and was there within 30 minutes. He fixed the problem, cleaned up any mess that was made from snaking a line, explained exactly what the problem was and was on his way. Easy breezy just how I like it! I will definitely use this company again!< /review>

They did an excellent job! Our toilets were backed up and Joe diagnosed the problem correctly, fixed it and everything is fine. They communicated very well throughout and followed up the next day to make sure the problem was fixed to my satisfaction. Absolutely great customer service and support!< /Review>

<review>Five stars for John Stevenson's plumber Tech, Mr. Alexander Cose. Over the last 13 years we have never had any plumber visit our home that gave us confidence to request a 2nd call.
That changed on Friday morning 15 March.
Mr. Alex Cose arrived on time, inspired our confidence in his professional inspection report of our bathroom plumbing system needs and repairs. He gave us our options and we are glad we had Mr.Alex to perform the repairs. Fast response to our call for help.
Parts arrived on time, installation was on time. We are so very satisfied and happy with his work. Alex will be called back by us again later this year when we plan to repair our other bathroom.Thanks  to all the support people at John Stevnson's that we talked to in regards to appointment and follow-up .
Thank God, we have a great go-to plumber, like your best barbershop or your best auto repair shop or best tax guy.
Thank you very much Mr.Alex for your great work on our bathroom plumbing.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Had a great experience with John Stevenson after having a horrible experience with Roto-Rooter.  I feel John Stevenson plumbing is fair and very skilled.  I feel completely differently about Roto-Rooter, who I will never call again.

My lesson - Go with someone you trust the first time.  Having to go back and get the work done again is costly.  Wish I would have called John Stevenson the first time out.<//Text>

< Review>
This plumber was more than 3x our original plumbing bid.  we went with the other plumber.  The first bid $1,039 with a possible extra $100.   John Stevenson company was $3,189- How does that happen.  we have a very small condo and were replacing 1 bathtub with a small apt size bathtub and the installation of the new drains and valves.  After the tile goes in we just need them to set a toilet and the sink.  It definitely was not over $3,000 work.  Both bids included the bathtub - which was only a little over $300.< /Review>

<text>Horrible.  Super bad customer service.  Scheduled both heating and plumbing whole house inspection..  Only sent plumbing inspector when both heating and plumbing inspections were scheduled.  Asked them to take pictures.  They didn't follow directions.  Their reports were as if they were in somebody else's house.  Complete waste of time and money.

<text>Travis was good but made us believe that we had to have a permit pulled for a gas leak, even though SDGE said one was not required.  He capped off our gas line to our BBQ and fire pit and said that was where the leak was.  Told us that we wouldn't be using that anymore.  Tried to sell us a new furnace and water heater (totaling 17,000.00).  We declined.  SDGE came out, turned the gas on (without a permit) and reconnected the gas to the BBQ and fire pit...no leak!  Not sure what Travis was trying to achieve.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1538491761763, 'text': 'Good Morning Melissa,\n\nWe are sorry to hear that you were less then satisfied with your experience with us.

Mike from John Stevenson Plumbing came to fix two "what we thought were small" jobs, but each was more complicated than anyone could have predicted. He did a great job and both the dishwasher and the guest room sink are now working perfectly.<//Review>

We pride ourselves in always taking care of our customers no matter the circumstances. We sent out our plumbing supervisor first thing in morning to address the issue that occurred yesterday. During the evaluation he noticed the full valve adjustment switch  was left down, and was not set causing the universal full valve to extend to its highest point allowing water to run. We corrected the issue immediately by making a minor adjustment to the part that should have been adjusted initially when it was installed by the previous technician who had forgotten. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with, or if you have any other questions or concerns please don't hesitate to reach out to us."}<//resp>< Rating>

<review>I highly recommend going elsewhere.  What an absolute debacle.  All I needed was a valve and line attached to the toilet and they couldn't even get that right.  I was at work and called to have a simple service done so that my elderly live-in mother-in-law could have access to the downstairs toilet (getting up and down the stairs is difficult for her, especially if she has "to go").  I thought they could get it working within the hour and I could continue my work that day.  The part was about $35 retail.  He suggested a rebuild of the toilet system (didn't really need it, but I figured it would be ok).  He quoted an initial price of $670.  Wait, what?!  That's what a brand  new toilet and installation goes for. He then said, "Ok, I'll do it for $500" and said he'd totally re-do the guts.  All of a sudden you can skim $200 off?  What are they trying to pull?  He said it would be like a brand new toilet.  I messed up and said ok.  My fault.  The total cost of parts at Home Depot would have been about $60.  He spent 45 at my house.  When I got home, it wouldn't flush properly, he did not replace or properly sit the handle, and when I woke the next morning, the work he had done was clearly faulty and I had to call for another tech to come out to fix it.  Do not waste your time or money with these crooks.  Find another company that is honest and actually has integrity.<//review><userid>105039491618767340813</userid><gmap_id>0x80dc735b0e021679:0x86970d1b99ed27fb< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Water Heater Problem.   I confirmed they would attempt a repair and not just want to replace.   I agreed to $89 to get an estimate for the repair.   I got the call that it would be $260 to get the estimate when the tech was on site.   Confused, I talked to the Manager.   They said "extenuating circumstances".    Bottom line they won't repair a water heater that is not up to code.   None really are at this time.    The manager admitted such and refunded my $89 because "it was not a business match for him".   Because I am not going to be a victim?   They tried to blame me saying it should have been replaced many years prior.   Advice: Always get multiple bids when it comes to water heaters.   Don't let them corner you with a tech there, they probably only have a replace option at an excessive price regardless of what they say up front< /Review>

I used this company for the water heater flush and whole home plumbing inspection. The technician Ryan Solis was incredibly helpful at not only identifying potential problems but explaining them to me so that I was able to understand how things work and the reasoning behind making certain changes.<//Review>

Price Gouging & poor customer service:
1) charged $222 to just remove the trap without solving the sink drain problem !!!
2) No responses from the multiple requests to discuss the issue with the managers ...

The technician Ryan misled the customer to sign the form (to charge $222) by promising to use snake to solve drainage in the pipe, but later Ryan asked the written permission from condo owner for using the snake in the cast iron pipe saying the insurance from the company does not cover damage from his using snake in the cast iron pipe.  When we asked why this condition was not revealed to us in the beginning, the technician Ryan told me it was the company's dispatcher responsibility to ask whether I rent or own the condo regarding the permission to use the snake in the cast iron pipe.

I was very unsatisfied for the incomplete job done by the technician Ryan and the fact that I was misled to sign to form to be charged $222. I think the partial work completed by Ryan was at most worthy the diagnosis fee $89, since I sign the form on the condition that Ryan agreed to use snake to solve drain problem, but he did not complete the job and later on Ryan even denied his oral promise.

I called the company multiple times and was not able to reach any manager via phone.  I left multiple messages to ask to discuss the issue with either Director of Operations Destry Thompson or his supervisor John Stevenson (owner), but had not gotten response after more than two weeks.

WHO would like to pay $222 for an unsolved kitchen drain problem? The same issue was solved within an hour by the professional plumber from another company.</review>

<text>Unfortunately this time around my experience was not good. I had used them in the past and everything went smoothly, the job was done and the customer service was excellent. This time however a different story. We called regarding a stopped up drain, they responded very quickly and sent someone over within a few hours. Not sure why but the guy that was sent couldn't do the work, but he quoted us $800 and said that he would be back on Monday. He never gave us the written estimate but told my husband that we would receive it via email, we did not receive it Friday or on Saturday. We had no idea what we were going to be paying for. I called on Saturday to request a copy of the work statement and the answering service said that I could leave a message and my called would be returned. No one called on Saturday. I called again on Sunday, and received the same message from the service. So I emailed them, I received an immediate response from Destry Thompson stating that no one returned my call yesterday because they were not in the office. But hey he had time to send an email response to my email? Still no resolution so I requested that he cancel my appt that was scheduled for 8am on Monday morning. He made no attempt to call me to resolve my issue but instead had someone from his office send me the invoice for $89 for the guy coming on Friday to look at the job. THIS ALL ON A SUNDAY BUT HE COULDN'T CALL ME BACK BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT IN THE OFFICE. However, he did have time to email and/or call Kristin Fox  from his office as I received an invoice from her on SUNDAY for $89.00 which was for a "plumbing diagnosis". Unfortunately now we are looking for another plumber, good thing there are quite a few to chose from. :)</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Horrible service. I needed a home reverse osmosis system installed. Selected this plumber as they profess to be water filtration system experts. When I called to set up the service appointment I explained I had purchased all my own equipment, just needed it installed. I requested a ballpark cost for an install, and all they could tell me that with an $89 service fee they could provide an estimate, and that fee could go towards the cost for service that they would be able to perform on the spot. I took a half day off of work to wait out my 2pm-4pm appointment window, with tech arriving at 3:40pm to give me a 10 minute sales pitch on the home house filters they sell and install. He proceeded to show me quotes on his tablet, and whoa nelly, to install my RO system was going to cost $845 AND since it was almost 4pm, his quitting time, I would need to book another appointment. OMG. This company is a joke. Tech was bragging about how much more money they make for residential projects compared to commercial jobs. As a commercial construction project manager, I know they are milking innocent homeowners by over charging them. My commercial plumbers are upfront about costs and do not try to push sales of unwanted products. I appreciate that the local dispatcher Juan called to apologize, but said “company policy” this is how they operate. I instead watched a YouTube video and installed the RO myself. Highly recommended not using this company! Cheers!< /review>

<review>Just had a really bad experience with these guys.  They replaced furnace igniters.  Priced them at $460 each (I had four replaced).  Found the units on the Internet after they did the work for $28 each.  I understand labor and overhead, but something's wrong with this picture.

Spoke with the Director of Operations Destry Thompson.  This is clearly an UNFRIENDLY to the consumer company. Avoid at all costs if you value customer service or good value.  First of all he wanted to charge me for an "evaluation".  I don't need an evaluation we already know the heater doesn't operate.  Then he went into quizzing me, but not about the problem or our concern, or how quickly they could come out, he we was quizzing me about property ownership and status.

We are in escrow on this home and need to replace the Heater prior to close.  Apparently it's a company policy to not provide estimates or work on a home in escrow.  I even told him, if he was concerned about wasting time, i'd be happy to provide photos and he could bid off of that if he wished, but we need the work done prior to the close.  He showed zero concern about the problem, and wasn't concerned about our needs.  He was focused on their company's policy.  Well Guess what Destry, my policy is not to hire Poorly managed companies.  You are the reason why consumers dislike contractors.

Oh by the way I asked for his supervisor and he told me He is the man.

Avoid them, there are way better HVAC contractors out there that want to earn your business.<//Text>

Was very friendly,  price quoted seemed high.  Not willing to negotiate the price. I felt stuck. Told me that pipe should not be exposed to sun , because it will detiorate, so when he replaced it. He left it exposed.  Didnt seem right .  Why wpuldnt you bury it?.  For the work done, and the price charged , would not recommend to anyone else.</Text>

<response>{'time': 1564413437457, 'text': 'Good Morning David Caron,\n\nWe are saddened to hear that we were unable to provide you with service in your time of need. During summer months we experience a higher influx of A/C repair calls which can make it very difficult to make it out to every customer at the time they request. Our dispatcher tried to work with you to get you rescheduled first thing in the morning the next day, you advised our dispatcher that you were only available for an appointment after 5pm which falls into our after hour appointments and are never guaranteed that we can make it out during that time. Because we were unable to guarantee you an appointment after 5pm, we believe it was in your best interest that you tried reaching out to another company that would be able to make it out to you in the time that worked best for you. We pride ourselves on always providing our customers with a five star service experience and we are sorry that you feel this is not what you received. Thank you for your feedback, If we can assist you in anyway moving forward please let us know.'}<//response><name>David Caron</name><rate>1</rate>< date>

<Rate>1</Rate><UserId.>101168244502140086495<//UserId.><Review>During our last cold spell I noticed our furnace pilot light was larger than it should be. Concerned we called John Stevenson who came out and charged us $89 to provide a quote of $610 to replace the gas valve. They also provided an alternative quote to upgrade to a new furnace. No qualifying specifications were provided on the replacement furnace - we were told we could look it up ourselves if we wanted more information which we did. No work was done on the existing furnace, our $89 was waisted on getting an estimate. We scheduled the replacement furnace installation only to find out the manufacture could not supply the product. John Stevenson offered an alternative unit which the scheduled installer admitted he knew nothing about when more information was requested.

We called several other companies who provided no cost estimates of $350 for the gas valve replacement and reasonable quotes for the furnace which we did replace. My advice - If you wish to receive honest and qualified estimates at no charge which is the norm in the Hvac industry, DON'T call John Stevenson!< /Review><resp>None</resp><time>1421877597230</time><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

{'time': 1595519090818, 'text': "Good Morning S.B.,\nThanks for taking the time to leave a review! Our technicians are almost always equipped to complete a job they are sent out to, but in this situation our technician was unaware that you lived in a 3-story complex. Although our trucks are stocked with regular ladders, for your particular situation we would need to use an extension ladder, which is a piece of equipment that we usually don't carry in our vehicles. We also offered to reschedule the service so that we could return with an extension ladder and an additional technician to make things right. We apologize for the inconvenience!"}< /Response>
