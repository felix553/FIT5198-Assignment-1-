Went on 1/2/2021 to ask for an upgrade and add a third line. Turns out, it's "migrating" not activating so they just asked us to call customer services. I was like.... We are right there with our ID and credit card, can't they just work on it? No. Asked can they call? No. Absolutely no services. The associate even said, "well, if I call, I'll have to wait for half an hour, still probably faster than you but you have to call yourself" and refused to help. Horrible service.</Review>

<text>Both Javier & his associate Nick were totally AMAZING.
After having 2 of the worst experiences EVER at T-MOBILE on Huntington Drive in South Pasadena with  rude person named "Raymond" I was freaked out to go to another TMOBILE store.
The two gentlemen that helped me were kind, helpful, clear, business like and were the total opposite of my other experience.
I recommend them and their service's withthe utmost conviction.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2c53e22cc8fff:0xe94c263a381a757<//gmapID><username>Nikki Sweet</username>< Rating>

I never really had a bad experience here and the associates are usually very helpful. I went for Black Friday and although they warned me about the systems being pretty slow (which they were) I had patience enough to wait to get my mom an upgraded phone and the rep Miguel was very friendly and nice and so very helpful. Although I can’t say the same for the manager/ supervisor there. David I believe his name was. He was very unfriendly and condescending when it came time for him to make a sales pitch to us. We didn’t want to switch plans or take the promo going on at the time for the car alert system thing they offer. But he kept coming back to remind us how we’d be saving money and get more for what we pay for. But his tone was unwelcome and he pretty much told us it’s our funeral for not going with this “amazing deal” I think they need to re-evaluate him as a leader because he was very rude, unkind, unfriendly and not welcoming at all. I might have considered his offer if he sold it to us in a much better manner.</text>

Lazy workers ! Every time I go there is  atleast 5 workers and only 2 of them are working while the others laugh and joke around . There is only 4 seats for all the customers they have waiting standing up in the hot room( no ac )  . Workers hostpatality is zero and they have no intention of helping out . As a customers stake holder consumer I am really dissatisfied with this store specifically. The workers managers and staff need to get fired or they need to have a new change with the ethics of its workers . I know the corporation of T-Mobile would not like to be represented like this .<//text>

<Review>Needed to get new phones for me, my wife and two kids. Went into Tmobile just to check out their prices and plans and ended up walking out a customer. Krista was the person who helped us and was so awesome. She explained everything clearly and in detail and made the whole process smooth and enjoyable. She made sure to get us all the promotions that would help us and went above and beyond to make sure everything worked out for us.

We went in near closing time and she stayed until 10:30pm to make sure our phones ported over and everything was taken care of properly. I don’t think we would’ve switched over if it wasn’t for Krista and her being so helpful.

We were able to get a better deal than at AT&T and were able to get iPhones for our kids who desperately wanted them. They have great deals going on like 4th line free and a buy 1 get 1 free phone special.

This Tmobile is right on the corner of Atlantic and Valley so it’s easy to spot. It’s also a real Tmobile, not one of those authorized dealer places. I’ll definitely come back here whenever I need anything for my phone.</Review><Rating>5<//Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><time>1465584918294</time></record>

<Text>Great customer service but wasted my time here. I was there to switch accounts to business and didn't save any money. Why would I even care about services I will never use. There is no point. If I knew I would of just called in. Instead I'm there switching accounts believing I will save some money. I actually lost money for not being at work instead. Man smh. Anyone can apply for ein number and get business account. You can get ahead of line that way no wait. Switch over to business if you have personal. It's free like I said just go irs website and applied for number. That and you get plans first and jump 3 times a year. Doesn't make sense to me to waste all that time of lying to wait more. Now my account is all over the place switching back and forth. In the end she bribed me $50 to stay with business and I said no you can't buy me with money. She said I would still get the credit. Never happened. Just a bunch of bs and broken promises. They don't make the rules but hey they represent tmobile. In the end I wasted time and money and was pretty much on the phone with tmobile all day and night because of that stupid business switch. I lost money instead of making money. That's how they start off with helping a business. It's a joke to me. The fact that she still didn't give me credit only showed that she was really bribing me with a one time 50 dollar credit to stay and desperate for sales. It ducks because I thought they were good people. Most of them were but I will never go in there again. And this is already the second chance I gave them as a regular customer come back and it's definitely not a place I would recommend friends to go. I would rather drive further or just call tmobile themselves it's worth the wait than the headache. But tmobile in all just gives you a headache they explain the good stuff but not the bad stuff. And after you switch to new plan their like oh well we can't change it because so and some it's like their system always want them to win. Anyway I'm trying to find a new service. Going to return everything I can and have them bill me. Their who company as a whole is a joke. That's why their giving out a bunch of free stuff. Just to get customers to switch. But I'll tell you one thing. though. At first I promoted tmobile after calling ciusomter care  and going Into the store my belief has went down like 90 percent. I would not recommend any friends or family to this spot or tmobile themselves.<//Text><name>Breaking Cements< /name><Gmap_id>0x80c2c53e22cc8fff:0xe94c263a381a757</Gmap_id>< Pics>

Service here is just terrible.  I have been waiting for two hours,  and still waiting. We have four staffs here,  three of them are working, one just chill around. And they only serviced two customers in the past two hours.  Staffs are not concentrated at work,  but keeps chatting with each others. If I'm not for urgent issues and other stores are close,  I would be long gone.</Text>

Beautiful historic property in the heart of the Mission District. Do not miss it on your visit as the architectural details are so evocative of the grand era of San Francisco. And definitely take a look at the Albers Flapjack Flour mural on the side --- sadly fewer and fewer historic painted beauties like this exist in the modern city. Then look up towards the roof of the neighboring building for a "ghost" advertisement in white paint!<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>This was our second year seeing the Golden Girls Live at the Victoria! Such a blast! I can't say enough about this show - so much fun from the sing-a-long to the show to the meet and greet at the end. The theater itself could use some updating - tiny bathrooms (with really long lines) and cramped seats - but it adds to the personality. Such a fun night!<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I stumbled across this place a year ago. I was in town and saw they had Hedwig & the Angry Inch, a personal favourite, so I went blindly. I didn't realize it was a smaller, Indy, semi-professional troop, but let me tell you it was absolute perfection. Hedwig with that cast, venue and crowd was a perfect mix. This year (2019) I was back for a quick trip and saw they had the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I know the music but not familiar enough to call myself a fan. AGAIN! A perfect marriage: the script, actors, venue and crowd making for an unforgettable experience. I will be back!!!</Review>

The seats are a little cramped (I'm a plus sized woman but I was still able to fit in between the armrests) and was very warm inside with all the other people. Staff was extremely friendly. Woman's bathroom only had 2 stalls. While the theatre was alright, the production was fantastic.< /text>

I love the Victoria. Over the past twenty years, I've had so many great experiences there. It's really an important part of my community. I do, however, think that maybe we can chip in and get them some better lights. Maybe I'm getting blind in my elder years, but I'm pretty sure a powerful spot light would liven up any show. 😑< /review>

I went to see an incredible musical called Caroline or change. The singers voices were absolutely incredible. I did not expect this high level of production and performance at such a small theater but I am glad that I was happily surprised. This is my first performance that I attended but I will definitely attend more in the future. They also offer popcorn and apparently have a bar so you can have drinks before the performance afterward and during intermission. Five stars</text>

I have seen several Ray of Light productions here and they have all been fantastic.  This is an old theater, but plenty of room in seats and I'm 6'4".  The bathrooms are always an experience but, they are trying some new policies which may help.</Review>

Great, awesome shows. I've if my favorite things to do in the bay area. The actors are amazing, the production value-very high. I buy the season pass which comes with a free drink every show. Love it</Review>

Such a fun place to visit for a rowdy show. The theater itself was kind of cramped but if i could describe any theatre as having character, it would be this one!<//review>

<text>I was here for the Spliff film festival.  It's a small theater with just the basics but the staff was friendly, the location was near a lot of good food, and everybody had a good time.  Not sure if this was just our show or because we sat in the front but the sound was cranked up crazy loud.  Might want to move back a few rows.</text><userid>112818161764066446203</userid></record></dataset><record>

Nice cozy theater. It's in a seedier part of the Mission and that's my biggest issue. Parking is about a block away at the Hoff St. Garage, with very limited street parking.<//Text>

Saw Ray of Light's " Hedwig and the Angry Inch". Great performance, but it's the second time now that I have a hard time hearing the performers over the music. Still a lovely show and I'll still be back for more for great programming<//Review>

Saw the stage production of the TV show, Golden Girls during holiday season. It was hilarious. The Blanche character was the best! During quick scene changes, there was a live organ playing and we sang Christmas carols. Very historic theatre in Mission District. If you have trouble going up and down stairs,  opt for a orchestra seat. It was a fun afternoon in beautiful San Francisco!</text>

Older theater with a lot of style and an intimate feel. I haven't seen a live show here, but it's a very pleasant place to watch a movie. The seats aren't the most comfortable, but that doesn't detract from the experience and I have zero other complaints.< /review>

Love this place, and they house some of the hippest theatrical events in town. My main complaint is that everything about it, from the lobby to the seats, feels so cramped. Even so, seeing Rocky Horror or drag recreations of the Golden Girls at this venue is pretty exciting.</review>

Saw a musical here with friends and really enjoyed it. Great production, cozy little venue. They even sell beer and snacks at the front desk (I had Junior Mints!) It's also right next to 16th st. BART to easily get there or make a quick getaway.</Text>

It's rough around these areas because there are a lot of homeless roaming the streets and some were on their bicycles with a stereo boom box 😂😂😂😂 but it's convenient enough if you don't want be bothered nor bullied. So you better realize where you are ppl and where you stand!< /Review>

It's a small theater that's rough around the edges. It's probably seen better days and it needs some upgrades to make it comfortable. We saw Carrie the Musical here and the sound, lighting, and setting seemed to work well for the space.<//review>

Un clásico en Mission, el barrio latino de San Francisco. El local es pequeño, antiguo, pero con gran sabor. La programación es de lo más variada y casi siempre está lleno. Lo peor es que siempre hay una gran cola para ir a los baños, para mujeres solo hay uno.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>My kids Love this park. Bathrooms are clean. Plenty of benches for parents to sit on. Swings for bigger kids plus a little one for toddlers. Basketball court. Covered sitting with awning for picnics. I recommend this park.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80ea4300f599d8e5:0x7329ab3d671425c1<//Gmap_id>< Name>

<text>If you want a taste of links golf this is one of the few courses I've seen (outside of Scotland) that will give you a good taste of links golf. The course has a GREAT layout with lots of bunkers of different sizes and depths just like in Scotland, the fairway bunker on one hole is about 200 yards long. Every hole is unique and different from the others which is refreshing, make sure you pick the right tee boxes to play from, the back tees on the par 3's are very tough. They have a country club style clubhouse with a great restaurant/bar with 80" televisions and the food is superb, the beer/wine list is one of the best I've seen at a golf course, and staff is great.< /text><userid>102560451070834303143</userid><pictures>None<//pictures><name>Henry Johnson<//name></record></dataset><record>

Food was what you would fine at a picnic and we had to pay for photos which was a first. Songs were outdated and the girls couldn’t get songs of interest played. But, it was nice that it was small and uncrowned and the music wasn’t blasted and ear damaging. It needs some intentionality for the next one.<//Text>< Pics>

Excellent park all around.  Ample parking as well as plenty of covered picnic area.  Two playgrounds with wood shavings make for a park that's great for everyone.  Restrooms and are available as well as drinking fountains.  Park also has plenty of grassy area for sports and there is a half court basketball available as well.< /Review>

Worst experience ever. Me and my friend went to go practice for tryouts in a few weeks. Halfway through, the guy stopped us and asked if we had a reservation. A reservation? Does he not understand what a community gym is? Seriously, I looked online to make sure it was open gym and it said it was. I grew up practicing here many times and it was open gym always, we never had a problem. We were practicing on a court, which was vacant of any sports playing, and weren't disturbing anyone. In fact we were on the other side of where the other team practicing was. I'm disappoint and will never be back here.< /text>

Nice, newer park with age specific playgrounds, large pavilions, and family bathrooms. Slides end a bit high from the ground, there's not much shade, and there is construction nearby but overall it's a fun place to play. My kids ask to go back there.< /review>

I stumbled upon this gem of a barbershop because of Starbucks. Amazing staff, cold beer and Victoria always gets my cuts right. Thanks On Tap for keeping the beers cold, keep the vibe as fresh as my hair cut.<//Review>

THE BEST BARBER SHOP IN THE IE.. GREAT FRIENDLY PEOPLE NO DOUBT.  PROFESSIONAL CUTS PLUS COLDEST BEER IN TOWN WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ASK FOR? BEEN TO OTHER BARBER SHOP'S IN THE IE AND ALWAYS GOT A BAD VIBE, ALWAYS SOMEONE DON'T LIKE SOMEONE "VERY UNPROFESSIONAL" YOU'LL NEVER FEEL THAT WAY AT ONTAP. I WOULD GIVE IT TEN STAR'S IF I COULD. GO CHECK IT OUT FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED. SHOT OUT TO BARBER'S "STEAVE" "ROMAN" "AYMARA" "BIG ED" "WILL"< /review>

<review>All I can say is if it wasn't Christmas Eve and tried every other place to get my sons haircut, I definitely would never walk in a place like that.  People drinking beer, vulgar music, especially with small children. I paid $20+ and still tipped good for a weak cut, I had to point out several mistakes to the girl.  I did see a few other barber's that were doing great with their cuts.  All in all I was thankful I was able to get my sons haircut on such notice, and for an adult this place would probably not be as bad, but for small children, id avoid.</review><time>1609002513634< /time><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c333dff6efdbe9:0xd440214a02f982d9<//GmapID><userid>117566080004799673948</userid></record>

He is extremely hard to work with, but she has the patience of Job! Her work is impeccable.  Steven, the owner cut and styled my husbands hair and beard. What an awesome guy, again the work was fantastic.  Love this place, always clean, friendly....but always busy, best to make an appointment!<//Text>< pics>

Worst barber I’ve been to yet , the cut was good but charged me $40 for a fade. Don’t go here at all . So they be setting any price they want . My brother went and got charged 30 just because he knew what kind of job I do . he charged me extra ..Do not go here , not worth the time or money. It’s funny Steve told me that he needs the extra money to keep the lights on, like dude . Other people have bills to pay to but what ever you can keep that extra $15.you can get charged $25 over at super cuts. I don’t recommend it< /review>

They take appointments so I recommend setting an appointment but they also take in walking. Also as you wait they sell various beverages to enjoy at their bar/waiting area. Fresh Cut along with a Fresh cold Beer ! What more can you ask for< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>He did a cut and after told me without even asking me first. Big blow to myself esteem and now my hair will need time to grow back for the way I’ve always cut it. Go to Country Cuts, I only came here cause Country Cuts was closed. I heard the shop is under new ownership, that explains a lot.<//review>< pictures>

It looks like they have a full bar there...not sure if they have a liquor license..didn't seem like it. I made the mistake of staying to get a cut knowing that they had probably been partying it up all day. "Steve" the owner ended up cutting my hair. The whole time he was trash talking an employee who wasn't there and previous clients. I couldn't believe how unprofessional he was. Well worst cut I've ever gotten..he was to busy trash talking to pay attention to what he was doing. He left my hair on top completely butchered. Do your self a favor and find a different spot...please save your money and your hair!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Worst haircut and service I've ever had. Dude was too busy coughing up a lung and checking his phone to cut my hair right. After an hour of misery I accepted my fate and went to Lil Ray's on Mission and Mountain.</text>

Do not recommend this place at all. Went in just for a line-up and after the lineup, the barber charged me $20. Explained to the guy how this is possible and talked to him. No other barber shop within a 1000 mile radius will charge someone $20 just for a lineup. Complete blasphemy. If the line-up was good I wouldn't complain.</review>

$20 for 15 min. haircut is ridiculous. But this is the best place in Ontario and that isn't saying much.  Hopefully I can find a better place soon. Also the workers always seem mad, maybe the new management made pay cuts to pay off the loan that was needed to buy the business.< /Text>

<response>None<//response><Review>First, i would give more stars because they do a great job...but...you must have an appointment or you will wait, a long time. There dont seem to be enough barbers on hand to handle heavy walk in traffic ( even at mid day in the middle of the day) and three times now the barbers there have been a bit snippy in attitude. My grandson likes this place and its usually the first place he asks to go, and like with life in general sometimes you just need a quick clean up or something has come up and you need a quick cut and maybe you dont have an appointment.  Its ok if you need one exclusively,  but advertise it. Dont say you welcome walk ins and then not have the staff on hand to manage it and have your staff overwhelmed. All of the times ive been there, ive waited a minimum of an hour, one time two hours. Now, all that being said, they do nice cuts, take their time and it has a hipster feel to it. If it were just the cut i would give 5 stars, but customer service is just as important.< /Review>< time>

Let me down this use to be my favorite place to come too. Called ahead to make sure they would still take me in, 20 mins before they closed they said yes then when I got there they turned me down, saying they are done for the day after all there appointments was disappointed to hear that but clearly they didn't care so unprofessional for sure would not recommend this place to anyone after this.< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>So this place had 3 barbers. I walked in and everyone had customer on the seat.. No one else was there. And I asked.. Is there anyone else waiting.. I was told nope you are next. Then another guy walks in.. They told him that he is after me. After waiting 45min one customer left. I waited for the barber to call me. But someother dude showed up with his kids. And the barber sat him down.. Must have been some one he knows... Wack customer sevice<//text>< Pictures>

The girl barber cut my face with the razor. She is always drunk and is always looking at her co-workers and to busy talking to them while cutting my hair. She is always distracted and not concentrated.< /review>

Great location, clean and comfortable.  The shower could be an issue for some.  Water was not super hot ever. The pictures online are slightly deceptive.  This place is not nearly as cute as it is in the pictures.  It is adequate, clean and walkable if you are in good shape. But, for the price you may find better lodging. Also, the lobby is closed, no cleaning service, no coffee, limited staff if you want anything....all supposedly COVID related, but still we stayed at our hotels on this trip without these restrictions.  The hot tub is closed.  Patio area is small and slightly dated.< /text>

<text>Wow. Just wow! After a long day driving up Big Sur, we were greeted by the most amazing helper, Orlando. He helped us checked in and gave us a very detailed overview of all the spots to see in Carmel by the sea. The rooms were so charming and we enjoyed our breakfast boxes by the gorgeous fire pit. Orlando was the key to our great stay at Hotel Carmel and, to be blunt, he deserves a promotion. We will be back hotel Carmel!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808de66afdb65255:0x2d2e25e00ac8706</GmapID></record>

<Review>The hotel location is great and the shared outdoor spaces are really nice. However, we were really disappointed with our room. We reserved a Delux King and it was not as pictured. It was really small and dark with one tiny window and one chair - it was pretty tight for 2 people! Also, we were right off the shared courtyard so our room was really loud (and we had to keep the shutters closed otherwise everyone in the courtyard would be able to see into our room making the room even that much darker). We were looking forward to a relaxing weekend where we could sleep in, but the noise in the courtyard would wake us up before 7AM. We asked if we could change rooms, but the hotel was fully booked. Based on the price (and the photos!), I was expecting a much nicer room and we were really bummed.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Adorable and cozy hotel just a few blocks off of Ocean Drive. Enjoyed my stay here, but only rating 3 stars for the late check-in (our room wasn’t ready until after 5pm when check-in is slotted for 3pm) and the lack of hot water (no one wants to take a cold shower when you’re paying $300+ a night).</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5</rate><Text>What a lovely boutique hotel! We will definitely stay here next time we are in Carmel. Walking distance to everything (about 15 min light stroll to the main beach and a short 5 min walk to all the shops/stores). Hospitality was great during our stay. Check in and checkout was easy (covid times).< /Text>< pictures>

A bit of a let down staying at the hotel Carmel. The staff was great but for the price of the room I would not recommend staying here. The room was extremely small and you could hear every movement and conversation from upstairs, the walls are very thin. For the $22 resort fee you get a parking spot, an empty hot tub and a grocery store muffin and yogurt for breakfast. Overall it was a bit disappointing.</review>

Our stay was great. A lot of stairs but that’s typical of Carmel. Our breakfast boxes were a nice surprise. And you can’t beat the location.<//Text>

<userid>103374176698664454971<//userid><Review>Small rooms, thin walls, horrible service. Stayed in Carmel for 8 days at three different hotels. This was hands down one of the worst hotel experiences we had that week if not throughout the past decade while visiting Carmel. We stayed at the sister hotel Playa de Carmel (which was great) and decided to visit Hotel Carmel to enjoy the hot tub and outdoor fireplace. On arrival we went to inspect the amenities only to find an empty spa and firepit/fireplace that the staff refused to turn on for us even though we saw another couple enjoying it a few minutes earlier. When booking the hotel the front desk was glad to mention the hot tub but failed to include details of it's inoperability due to Covid-19. Once checked in to the room, we were disappointed at the lack of space and super cramped bathroom not to mention paper thin walls. After 1 night, we decided to cut our 3 night stay short and booked a room @ Svengaards across the street. While not as 'nice' it had ample room and friendlier service. As we were packing up ready to leave, the staff were loudly conversing about how happy they were to have our room check out. Super unprofessional especially when we apologized for the early check out and personally tipped the lady @ the front desk $100. AVOID. Difficult to mess up a hotel stay in Carmel but this one managed to pull it off!<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

3 star hotel with 5 star pricing gets 2 stars here.  No AC or fan, windows cracked open but that did nothing to relieve the stuffy ness of our very small hotel room.  Bathroom was small and no tub space.  $620 per night was a huge waste of money.  1 star for friendly staff and one for a clean room and decent bed.   Also terrible parking lot that you have to back out of with any space you pick.</text>

Wonderful hotel tucked away from Ocean Ave, yet close enough to walk to everything. Comfortable and clean accommodations with friendly staff.  Love the overnight oats with fresh berries for breakfast and Lavazza coffee in the room.  The bagel bar is great with the variety of cream cheese flavors (hello pesto!) and delicious jams.  Wine hour features great labels, both white and red. The fire pit is a great place to sip some wine and have a conversation.  I'll definitely come back. Thanks Hotel Carmel!</text>

Stay somewhere truly dog friendly. Terrible customer service and clarity around their policies. Hotel Carmel came up as a pet friendly hotel. While booking online there was no indication that some rooms would not be suitable so I booked my room. I called to inform the hotel that I would have a dog, since there are usually additional charges. I was informed that the room I was in was not pet friendly and they had no pet friendly rooms available. So now less than a week before my trip they graciously canceled my room and I was left looking for a hotel that is truly pet friendly. It is shameful that they look to list themselves as pet friendly but then only reserve a small fraction(queen rooms only) of their rooms to accommodate pets with no clarity on their website. I was treated poorly and dismissed on the phone when I suggested they update their reservation system to indicate  what rooms are available for pets. They were able to clearly indicate other specifications on their rooms, why not this. Both reservations and the supervisor I asked to speak with just told me it’s not their area, it’s someone else’s job. Not helpful and completely avoidable.< /Text>

Beautiful hotel, great location and easy access to the beach and town. The wine hour is a great touch as well as the breakfast. The rooms are clean and luxurious. We didn’t get a chance to stay very long during this trip but I would definitely go back.

Great stay, parking was never an issue for us as mentioned in previous reviews. Staff was accommodating, rooms were clean and relaxing. Hotel Carmel offers privacy yet still being within walking distance to everything Carmel has to offer. We traveled here for a few nights for our babymoon and then headed up to San Francisco and immediately wanted to come back to Hotel Carmel. There’s nothing like it-will stay here next time we come back!<//review>

Visiting from UK, we had a relaxing stay. Room clean, a bit basic but it had all we wanted. We had a fireplace room and really enjoyed the sitting area outside. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was also good. A limited choice but actually it was enough. Would suggest that the peanut butter should not be near the nut free spread. Parking is a bit limited. The town itself is very relaxed and laid back. We had a great time. Off to Frisco for the second part of our holiday, I suspect Carmel has given us a great introduction to the Californian way of life.< /review>

<review>Lovely clean room No AC, not really needed by the ocean, but our room was right near the beautiful courtyard and fire pit and hot tub. If we closed the windows no option for air( we were offered a fan) if they were open it was loud.there are plantation shutters so they do not provide privacy  and room for air circulation at the same time. The hot tub and courtyard close at 930/10, but I definitely fell asleep and woke up to people talking :(</review>< Resp>

<review>The location, landscaping, and design of this hotel is spectacular. The amenity of waking up everyday to their beautiful courtyard filled with succulents, Talavera tile, luscious vines, a fire pit circled with soft Adirondack chairs, fireplace, and a jacuzzi is worth every penny to me! But then there’s breakfast that for us included a choice of bagels with six or seven spreads, overnight oats with berries, yogurt, granola, and/or breakfast burritos. There was also always coffee, delicious OJ, and water. Their lobby is charming and Brophy’s tavern is wonderful and a must. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. The room was great as well. We will most definitely be back! Thank you Hotel Carmel for giving us an unforgettable honeymoon stay!!< /review>< pics>

I give four rather than 5 stars because breakfast is quite limited, they give you very small pours at the wine hour, parking is first come first serve in a small lot, and the hot tub area is super dark! They need a light or two for safety in that area. In terms of the limited breakfast and wine hour, we recently experienced both ideas executed just a little better at Pacific Gardens Inn in Pacific Grove.</text><rate>4<//rate></record>

I think somehow we might have gotten the worst room in the hotel. It did not look like the images online and you could barely move around the bed, with a small sliver of a window that looked out to where people would walk so we couldn't even leave it open. Very depressing and we paid 400+.

*You should fully disclose what the room is like before you sell if for 400+ there should be a cap on a room like that ie 200 if not less.</text>

No parking. They told us to either park in the handicap spot or down the street since my 4runner didn't fit into the limited covered parking. The walls are incredibly thin. We heard every conversation in the next room.< /review>

Large, recently-remodeled rooms, most with large private balconies. Cozy lobby area  with a number of amenities. The hot tub and sun deck is a great place to hang out. Also love the sports bar, which is probably the best in Carmel! Overall, a really great place to stay and excellent value for the area.</Review>

<text>This newly remodeled spot is conveniently located in the heart of Carmel. Nothing but praise. We had an upstairs fireplace room that was large, comfortable and well appointed. Staff was friendly and helpful. Bed was ridiculously cozy and comfortable. The adjacent pub under the lobby on the street level was fun and tasty for a snack. Parking can be a little difficult, but nothing too inconvenient. Lovely stay.< /text>< pictures>

Hotel Carmel is super cute. We stayed here for two nights and it was great for the most part. The hotel is only two blocks away from the downtown area. You can walk to the most wine tasting rooms within 5-10 minutes.The only thing that I wish it was better was the bathroom size. Also, it wouldnt hurt if the staffs were friendlier. I had to find out about the resort fee charge on my credit card statement instead of at the check-out time.<//Text>

Staff was great, but no a/c, and weather was warm. They brought a fan, but we were under impression that the hotel was air conditioned. Had to sleep with windows open.  Only about 17 parking spaces for 27 rooms. Housekeeping staff was wonderful, but we had ants in bathroom. Breakfast was bagels or yogurt and granola. Bed was comfy. Nothing very special about this establishment.< /review>

Charming space & ambiance (fire pit/outdoor fireplace). Rooms are clean & well-kept, but the walls are paper thin! Could hear my neighbors arguing nightly, and if I could easily hear them, they must have heard me. Unfortunately, they couldn't change my room, and I was there for work. I do not recommend staying in a room with an adjoining door, unless you're going with family and don't mind hearing everything from phone calls to arguments. Not the best place for quiet.</Text>

<text>Thanks for asking for input,  there were positives and needs improvements which ended up netting an average rating in my experience. Spacious, clean and modern room and staff were great, parking was tight, value was lower than average based on rate, fees (which were mentioned, to cover breakfast) were high based on value- perhaps better as optional,  and noise levels were high from outside normal conversations which seemed to permeate through the wall and closed windows,  car doors opening and closing, as well as neighbor units when bathroom facilities were used. I wear ear plugs to block noise for sleeping, they were not effective enough.</text>< pics>

<review>This is a nice hotel. It is very comfortable and it is in the middle of town close to everything. They need to work on controlling noise here though. On a Friday between noon and 4pm, very loud guests were speaking, almost yelling, in the patio area. When they finally shut up, some one spent an hour with a blower or something. Very noisy. The manager should consider how stressfull all this noise is for guests and try to contain some if it.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<resp>{'time': 1548977096548, 'text': 'Alissandria, it sounds like you had an amazing family gathering and a truly special celebratory occasion! We are thankful for your kind review and are glad all members in your party enjoyed their stay. The Paradise Fire was a terrible tragedy and displaced so many. It was the least we could to ensure all our guests were comfortable and their rooms were ready. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience, I hope we have a chance to welcome you back soon!'}<//resp><Time>1547352332028<//Time><review>We had planned on a family reunion just before Thanksgiving at the Hotel Carmel, and we ended up inviting a few other friends to turn it into a celebration of family, marriage, and fun! Hotel Carmel was wonderful to work with and made all of the guests feel special. Using all 30 of the Hotel Carmel’s rooms, we were excited to have the patio with fireplaces and other communal spaces for friends and family to chat late into the night.

A few of my cousins were happy to re-tell how they kept Brophy’s open an hour past closing while watching a football game. Friends regaled how happy they were to wake up with a cup of Nespresso and the ocean view. A great uncle thanked the staff for cleaning his room after he later decided to switch with another guest for less walking. I appreciated the staff’s quick return with ice and a long table when my brother decided to add a 3 year old’s birthday to the list of celebrations.

Renting out an entire hotel for 3 nights might seem crazy, but I can confidently say it was worth it at Hotel Carmel. To make matters even more complicated, the Paradise Fire hit northern California at the same time of our reservation. As a result of families fleeing south, Hotel Carmel was completely booked before and after our event. I commend the hotel staff for flipping 30 rooms in a day - twice in one week.<//review>< pictures>

Great location to Ocean Ave. Enjoyed the fire pit and outdoor fireplace. Breakfast selection is poor compared to other hotels nearby. Nespresso machine in each room but the one in our room and also in our travel mates room did not work correctly.<//text>

The place was very nice and clean.  The people working there were very friendly and welcoming.  There is a great hang out space that is great to sit in outside and enjoy wine.  The only complaint is the walls are thin and could hear the people upstairs walking/talkkng early in the morning!<//Text>

<Text>This is essentially a motel, charging luxury hotel prices. For over $400 per night, they provided a basic room overlooking the parking lot. Shockingly, the hotel does not even have air conditioning, unheard of for even the lowest budget lodging, and something they don’t tell you on that snazzy website of theirs or when you make a reservation. To make matters worse, the windows are very old, with non functioning cranks that prevent you from opening and closing them. When we complained about how uncomfortable the room was, we were simply told that the windows were very old and needed replacing (no kidding). Breakfast consisted of a tray of bagels and some yogurt cartons. As others have noted, they tack on a resort fee to the already high published price, despite the fact that this is not disclosed in advance, and there are no resort amenities to speak of. In many years of traveling, I’ve never received so little value for my money.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Patio for two facing courtyard. Firepit, fireplace, hot tub outside. Complimentary breakfast (orange juice, yogurt, bagels, granola, coffee) 730-1030am and wine hour 530-630pm. Connected to Brophy's which has the most amazing jukebox.</review>

What a wonderful hotel! Brilliant location for exploring delightful Carmel, friendly staff, beautifully fitted-out rooms, plus beds and pillows that are probably the best we have ever encountered in a hotel.

We found the hotel somewhat difficult to communicate with when booking, but persevere - it's worth it.

Tip: make sure you book a room with a fire if you're visiting in winter.</text>

<Text>I have stayed here once before and the property is in a prime location, Brophy's Tavern is an awesome pub with a great bar tender, the beds are very comfortable, the room is spacious with a fireplace, and the bathrooms are newly remodeled.

The CUSTOMER SERVICE from YASSER M. was above and beyond, though. I have a wedding party staying here at the end of the month and he spent an hour with me on the phone making sure everything was perfect. I am in the services industry, and his level of commitment to my happiness should be commended. Not many people would have been as patient and kind as he would have been; we had to arrange nearly 15 rooms for different guests traveling at different times.

If you are staying in Carmel (by the Sea) and you need a place to call home for a couple days, look for Hotel Carmel and Yasser - they will not disappoint.<//Text>< name>

Nice BnB but noisy indeed. Ceiling and side walls are extremely thin and you hear everything. Our room was not spacious but actually as decribed so I cannot complain. Rooms are nicely equipped with Nespressos and minibar. The matraces at least for us where a real nightmare way too soft. We liked the location close to the shopping areas. Ocean is far away though. All in all I probably would select this hotel again although they did not do anything wrong.<//text>

We came here last Friday and discovered that it is the ideal location for all of your beer and booze needs. They had a large selection of wines and beers. The team was also eager to help you. Come take a look around!</Text>

Helpful staff who know their wines well! The service was excellent and the wine was very delicious. Their staff was also very helpful and responsive. They have all the wine that I wanted on that day. It was a remarkable day for me! The wine shop was also very clean and looks very elegant. Strongly recommended to everyone!</review>

I go there all the time to make money orders and went there to cash my check and the guy took a picture of my check AND my ID and then told me no. I even showed him my birth certificate. Why ask for all that and take pictures and say no. What are you guys trying to do with my information? If you are not going to cash my check then you should not have taken a picture of it and my ID that’s weird. I even had all my old paycheck stubs on me because I’m on my way to an appointment for a house so I had everything with me and my family has even been going there for years but not anymore f**k this place</text>

Love the staff here. Known them for many years. And this is Also a lucky spot for lotto players ! Many millions of dollars have been won at this location alone, about a dozen or so times. They were even front page of the Mercury News.<//Text>

BEST place to cash your paychecks for a small fee. It's a great place for a convenient stop with a huge variety of refreshments or Alcohol, Ice Cream, Candy, Chips, and Lotto Scratchers. They are very nice there.<//Review>

Such a rude customer service they do , A person with Turban( Sikh) , He says He is the owner of the store very very rude to me and refused to service without any reason.
I have never faced this kind of rude and unprofessional person in my life
I would give -‘Ve rating if I have the option</Review>

<pics>None<//pics><Review>I am not sure what is going on with the young clean shaven guy at this store, but I have had several issues with scratchers. I was sold a $30 scratcher that was already scanned (Bar code showing), gives the wrong cash prize values (Less not more). It could be honest mistakes but I have never experienced any issues until he started working the cashier station.<//Review><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

When I asked the guy who said he was the owner to finish my Western Union transaction before helping someone who walked up in the middle of him servicing me, he told me no cuz they don’t like people to wait. I told him I thought that was rude cuz I had to wait and that one customer could wait as well. He then refused to service me and told me the service was down when he literally just helped 2 people with Western Union right before me.< /Text><user_name>Erica Barber< /user_name></record>

This is my local library and I come here all the time. It’s very nice and quite big. They have a good selection of books it’s just that the Raina Telgmeier book are hard to find. Those books are my personal favorites. They have a lot of Geronimo Stilton books which is good because I read them a lot!</Review>

Wonderful place. Restrooms tend to be dirty often. Most of the staff is great, friendly and helpful. Except for one particular Male. (He should leave if is not happy there assisting and answering questions)<//Text>

there is a lot of noise at the information desk and the noise and loud paling disturbing to read and focus on research.
Library, especially staff at the Information Desk must be notice customers to respect the calmness around the library.

I come to the library to use it a quite space to study, but I do not see a lot changes between here the place that l live.

I hope changes could be occur.< /review>

Since then I have  gone there to use their computers, and laptops. And I have found many DVD  resources that are also exceptional, my two favorites being the Fringe TV series and an outstanding miniseries called America. Muscle cars.

There are areas within the property that can definitely make driving a large truck more difficult, with that said if we know in advance that you will be moving in using a large truck we can try to find a space that will be the easiest access. The building has been there for a long time as you mentioned however we do stay on top of maintenance items and get annual roof inspections to ensure we are keeping the property in the best condition possible.  This coming year we plan to paint and have all of the doors to the property replaced which will give the building a fresh look that more represents the way we maintain our buildings.'}< /resp></record>

<review>Yes I defiantly recommend this storage place. They are very helpful. They have great prices and deals. The people are very helpful and nice and will work with you. I am so proud to know about this place my mom has had a storage here for about 20 yrs or more and I myself have have just started and they are very helpful and amazing. The only place I will go for a storage unit. Go in and talk with these lovely people. They are very amazing and helpful. Great deals too. Open 7 days a week. Great hours and prices 😊 They got cameras everywhere they can see everything alarms for all the units. Everything’s very safe and trusted.< /review>< Rate>

<username>Theresa Woehl<//username><time>1506749455568<//time><rate>5<//rate><Text>We needed to find a storage facility that was close, clean and well maintained as well as open hours that worked for us and our schedules. This facility was recommended by a family member so we thought we'd take a look. The office was clean, orderly and the office personnel was courteous and seemed to know the answers to our questions.
She took us to view the different size units as we were not sure what size for sure we would need. They were clean and easy to get into to. The hours of operation are great for us, later than any I've ever used in the past which works for us (10pm) currently. The access in and out of the facility has been fast and easy at the gate and you have plenty of time to enter or leave before the gate closes so you don't have to feel like it's going to close on you. I would recommend this facility if your looking to store your belongings.< /Text>< Pics>

I've had this storage unit for 21 years.  It is always clean and neat.  The staff has always been friendly. And there isn't a lot of in and out traffic at this location.<//review>

Very pleased with the service. Im so pleased, in fact, that we are repeat customers. The property is very clean I would recommend it to anyone. Super friendly staff and good rates. They do have an insurance fee $10 That can be waived if you have renters insurance.< /Text>

Super friendly staff and good rates. I setup automatic payments and don't have to think about it. They do have an insurance fee between $10-12. That can be waived if you have renters insurance. I pay $72 a month for a 5X10</Review>

<Review>I have worked with Michele for at least 10 years and have found her to be excellent with marketing, customer service, and managing daily operations.  As a broker and property manager, I refer my clients exclusively to Michele as I know they will be treated honestly and fairly.  Great job Michele.< /Review>< response>

<Text>I have been there 6 months. I had shared a storage with someone that did not want to share anymore and I was treated so nice and personable by the management there that I decided to stay and get my own smaller space. It is nice and clean and such an easy process to rent from the beginning. Thanks!< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>The storage itself is great and trusting, the staff there are helpful as well.  If you accidentally lost the key to your storage, they'll easily help you bust the lock open for you, hence, because of that, you will need to buy a new lock afterwards lmao.</Review><gmapID>0x8091aad411f234e5:0x5a58311186fd7e61<//gmapID><user>107652546778677830455< /user>< Time>

i contacted this storage place before even moving to CA from TN and since day 1 everyone has been more than helpful. moving across country isnt ever easy but security public storage just made it that much less stressful when it came to storing my things. i have been there for almost 6 months now and have yet to have any issues.  i would not store any where else</text>

I think this is the safest unit storage due to the cameras everywhere and the best of all the owner has a house next to the storage that's a plus.< /Text>

<review>Very nice , people are great , I found myself very late one night with a truck load if my personal things and the storage place I was going to had closed , I called them up they helped me over the phone , and I unloaded and the next day took care of every thing else , I can't tell you how grateful I was , it had been a stressful day , then to have the storage unit I had rented closed , was even more stressfull
But when I called them up and they said no problem I was relived , thank you so very much
God bless ,  ,
For your storage needs to go see them ,  they will do you right ,</review></record>

<review>If you love supporting small businesses, Mario’s Auto Repair is one of the best places for general auto repair in Gardena. They are family-owned and operated for many years and they know how to do it right. Honest and fair-priced, there’s real value for you to come here for your car’s needs. I drive a 2007 Ram 1500 so you know I’ve had repairs done and Mario’s Auto Repair has always treated me fairly and honestly, making recommendations but never being pushy about it. I’ve had A/C work, transmission service, tune-ups, oil changes, shocks, brakes, and alignment and never once felt I didn’t get quality work for a great price. Calling around for prices will convince you, too! I have recommended them to friends before and they agree, so now I’m recommending you check them out, too, you won’t be disappointed!</review>< time>

This shop is the best.... I’ve always worked on my own cars but this time i needed help from the pros.. I needed a timing chain replaced and other items as well. I was not wanting to do this at first cause it is a pricey repair. However they were the best priced and gave me a warranty on parts and labor, I’m glad I did it with this shop they are very friendly and honest. I can’t stress how important it is to have a honest mechanic by your side.. they are the best at what they do and their work speaks for itself. I will gladly come back and refer friends and family.. Oh it’s also a family owned shop which is a huge plus. Thanks Mario’s for everything you guys are the best.<//Text>

I visited Marios about a month ago. I was nervous because my car needed some work before moving across the country. The service was outstanding. From the minute I walked in they treated me like family, were very friendly and put my mind at ease. I wasn't sure what all needed to be done, they checked over everything and told me what needed work and what I could wait on.  They showed me every single part they put in, they gave me options on which brand of tire and explained the differences of each one and which they recommended. I have never worked with such honest mechanics, they did excellent work on my car and barely charged me anything for labor. It's hard to find a good mechanic, and I was really glad I found this one. I would highly reccomend this business!<//review>

Thank you for your honest work and getting my car back at a reasonable time I will bw taking all my cars here. Don't just take your car to any mechanic who will just tell you anything to get your money and still don't do your car right. Take it to Mario Auto Repair< /text><Resp>None</Resp>< userid>

They earned my business today by saving me from a car accident. They allow me to see their work and explain exactly what my car needs and how dangerously, bad condition my car was. My back and front brakes were practically gone. As a businessman myself , I can truely say they are Honest mechanics and they are proud of their work.

I will definitely promote them by bringing them business from people I know.

Great place! We needed someone to pickup our car from a storage facility and later dropped off at a shipping company.  They were willing to do all that in addition to the repairs the car needed.  Junior and his father went above and beyond.</review>

<text>My truck began to break down on the freeway near this shop recently so I drove the truck to their shop before it completely died on me. I was stranded 45 minutes away from home and the guys at this shop diagnosed and repaired the truck in a few hours while I caught lunch nearby. I was back home just a few hours later. They took care of me and my truck when I really needed help and I feel they treated me honestly and did a good job. Thanks guys.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I required repairs to my vehicle's emergency brake system and rear brakes and everyone at Mario's was very helpful and professional.  The final cost was on par with what I expected and fair.  They went above and beyond by helping me drive my car to a drop-off site from their shop when I couldn't be there in person.</Text>< resp>

We were amazed at the cleanliness, proffessionalism and effectiveness of this business. Our vehicle was fixed and ready to go within minutes and that was very much appreciated, we needed this, this is now our official mechanic shop and we highly recommend it.

My truck failed a safety inspection from the LA VPC and I was turned away. I had to get my E-Brake adjusted. I called Mario’s Auto and explained to them my situation and that I was scheduled to fly out of the country the next morning. They told me to swing by and so I did. When I got there, they were very friendly and very helpful. They understood exactly what I was going through. They told me they had a big job coming out of that VPC once before. They were able to get that particular car up to code for VPC to deliver it. The coolest part about that story is, the owner was in Hawaii. That customer contacted them via phone and they made it happen. Just like how they made it happen for me. These guys will help their customers as much as they can. Family owned and family operated. When I got to the shop, they stopped what they were doing and they fixed my truck. I would’ve paid more and waited longer at another shop. I totally recommend this shop!</review></record>

<review>These guys are great. I had a leaking radiator hose and it was over 100 degrees. I'm new to the area and didnt know where to go. I had a bad experience at a place down the street and didnt want to get robbed again so I Googled the nearest auto repair shop. The reviews were great at Mario's so I decided to give them a shot.The guys at Mario's auto were fast, friendly and gave me a great price to replace the hose. They are trully family operated and they treated me like a valued customer. I highly recommend these guys for all your auto repair needs. You have gained a loyal customer. Thank you to all the staff at Mario's, this world needs more businesses like yours.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Yesterday I was trying to find a place to solve a problem that my van had since the engine light had come on and although they had already told me before that the code corresponded to the catalytic one and I wanted to solve the problem soon so I precisely found Mario's Auto Repair and I really came out very satisfied since from the beginning Mr. Mario Jr behaved very kind and honest. Very professional I solved the problem I did not have to wait long and I had never found a place like this excellent service, their prices are very fair and they try to make the customer 100% satisfied that is why this day I return again and take my other vehicle to have the brakes changed and in the same way it was an extraordinary service I recommend this workshop in the past I have had very bad experiences but I think that from today my problems and headaches with mechanics have remained in the past, I hope to continue bringing my vehicles to Mario's and I will recommend it to anyone who needs a place where if customers care, thank you very much God Bless you and I give you 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

El día de ayer estaba tratando de encontrar un lugar para resolver un problema que tenía mi van ya que se le había encendido la luz del engine y aunque ya me habían dicho anteriormente que el código correspondía al catalítico y yo quería resolver el problema pronto así que precisamente encontré a Mario's Auto Repair y realmente  salí muy satisfecho  ya que desde un principio se comportaron muy amables y honestos el señor Mario Jr . muy profesional me resolvió el problema no tuve que esperar mucho y nunca había encontrado un lugar como este  excelente Servicio,  sus precios son muy justos y tratan que el cliente quede 100% satisfecho es por eso que este día regrese de nuevo y lleve mi otro vehículo para que le cambiaran los frenos y de igual manera  fue un servicio extraordinario  recomiendo a este taller en el pasado eh tenido muy malas experiencias  pero creo que a partir de hoy mis problemas y dolores de cabeza  con mecánicos han quedado en el pasado , espero seguir trayendo mis vehículos a Mario's y lo recomendaré con cualquiera que necesiten un lugar donde si les importe los clientes muchas  gracias que Dios los Bendiga  y les doy 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Darcy was so helpful! Even though her computer was down, she was still able to provide me with all the information I needed and show me around the grounds. Everything looked clean and safe. Also, you can rent online with public storage and go straight to your locker! So convenient! Thanks to Darcy, I will be choosing public storage because it stands above all the competitors!< /review>< Response>

OMG the manager Darcy is the best! I would definitely recommend this place not only because her customer service skills are on point, but she also keeps it really clean. And I don't want to put my stuff in some dirty storage unit. So you should come here because this place is better than the rest!!!!</Text>

I highly recommend this facility. Over the years the property manager Darcy has been more than accommodating and gone above and beyond many times. She is a great example for the company and provides great customer service. The property is clean and well maintained. There are also security cameras and a gate that you have to use a code to get through. There is a clean, onsite restroom that is available during office hours. As well as push carts also available during office hours. Only down fall is rate increases. But I guess you get what you pay for and with rates increasing all around us, it is understandable. Also, I feel safe here and know my stuff is well taken care of. So all in all, it is worth it!</Review>

< Review>
Came in with my 2 kids who were all over the place and super distracting and had to figure out what size storage unit to rent all while being in a big hurry. The manager, Darcy, was MORE than helpful. She was very accommodating to me and especially my children. She let my toddler sit and color and helped me figure out what unit & price point I needed in a very quick manner. Super easy process! My oldest had to use the bathroom and I was very happy that the restroom was extremely clean! Actually the whole place was very clean and well maintained. We had a great experience signing up for a unit there and the fact that the manager was so nice and great with my kids was really helpful. I would definitely recommend that property!</Review>

When We Moved In We Had To Buy A Circular Lock, We also Paid the Insurance That would Cover up to $3000. Loss, for the low price of $11.50 each month. The prices were decent.
I called the Manager there to inquire about holding a “garage Sale” on their property. I was told to Advertise on Craigslist by appointment only. And I had to escort each Browser In and Out Of The Gate. We planned to do this on the Monday coming.  On Either Saturday or Sunday Someone Cut The Aluminum Hasp And Defeated the locks on 6 units. Nobody Else’s Lockers Items were touched. $5000. Worth of Electronics Some New still in the Box, The Rest in Excellent Condition Was Stolen. No Cameras, No Alarms, The Sheriff Wouldn’t Even Dust For Prints. Since I Could Not produce Bills, Serial numbers, Photos, or Proof that We Had Any Of What I Claimed. Their Insurance Settled For $780. We Cleaned the Locker Out That day.</review>

Darcy was very helpful. I made same day reservations and was able to check in the same day. I was running 10-15 minutes late and Darcy was understanding and accommodating. The check-in process was quick.  Thanks Darcy for being so helpful!< /Text>

Darcy is incredibly gracious, knowledgeable and professional. She has been the manager here for years. I highly recommend this storage company/location. I have used two other Santa Rosa storage facilities in the past and will not use them again. I was so happy with the paperless process, easy & efficient.
Thanks Darcy!< /Text>

We’ve been using the Public Storage facility on Santa Rosa Ave for almost three years and couldn’t be happier. The facility is conveniently located near the freeway and is always clean and well maintained.  Darcy is friendly, organized and extremely helpful. As long as I’m living in Santa Rosa this is the only storage facility I need. I highly recommend it!<//Text>

Easiest storage process that I have been through! And it's all thanks to the manager Darcy! She made my difficult and stressful move a little more easy by offering a quick and clear paperless lease, a happy attitude and helpful suggestions for packing our stuff! Who could ask for more?</review>

Just rented a unit here. So far, the highlight was dealing with Darcy, one of the storage property managers. She was thorough, knowledgeable, professional and helpful. She was a real pleasure to work with. The unit itself was clean and easy to use. The property appears to have good security, the access is easy provided you have the gate code, and it is right off the highway.</review>

Without a doubt, this is the best storage location I have ever used. Having used several different storage companies over the years, I can confidently say that Public Storage rates #1 on my list. Additionally, they have at this location the absolute best property manager I've ever known. Jennifer is personable, attentive and a hard-working employee. She regularly checks to make sure that my needs are met. I'll be using this company for all my storage needs from now on.< /Review>

I love my local Public Storage. The manager, Jennifer, is extremely helpful!! The facility is well kept. I feel very secure leaving my belongings there, which, of course, is extremely important to me. I appreciate the professionalism of everyone I've worked with at the facility on Santa Rosa Avenue. If asked, I would most definitely recommend Public Storage.<//Review>

<text>Jennifer at Public Storage is so helpful and wonderful. She's knowledgeable, polite and kind. She's helped me with difficulties I've been having (not the storage facilities fault). If she doesn't know the answer to a question, she finds the information quickly and relays it quickly. The property is clean and secure. I've had a storage space here for about 16 yrs. In the past, I had some trouble with employees who didn't know what they were doing. Jennifer's great. She's a real help at a time when I need it.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>This was my first storage unit I rented, ever.  Darcy was very helpful and knowlagable about products and units. She was very up front and honest with what I needed when it came to supplies and space.   Working customer service for years myself she was very friendly and professional, and I appreciate that. I was very comfortable knowing she was helping and with how tidy and safe the property was.  Darcy gets all five stars.....I wish I could make them gold!<//text><username>Laura D</username></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I recently went by several storage facilities to find a suitable storage unit to put my elderly father's belongings into (he is going into a full-care retirement home); I must say, out of  the various places that I visited, I found that Jennifer at Public Storage was by far the most helpful! She was very kind and understanding regarding my father, and went the "extra mile" to take care of my questions and concerns. I was very pleased by the service that I received, and would recommend this storage facility to others.

Sincerely,
Elizabeth Mesa< /review>

<Review>Our two and half years renting a space at Public Storage was perfect:  Now retired, we sold our very large home and downsized to a home 1/3 the size. 2/3s of  our valued belongings needed a temporary home as we began to sift through them, and build a storage shed at our new home. The units at the site are clean, the grounds well-kept, and Jennifer was always so warm, friendly and helpful in every way.  We would recommend this location to anyone. Our 'stuff' felt very safe there.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Jennifer always makes my experience a good one when I have to deal with my storage, I've had some not so good times with others in the past I don't care to mention names. I can say ill be back she is an awesome host I guess you would call it. I'm not one to write a review but I felt after her turning my not so good trips to storage in to a good one I thought why not same something<//Text>

Darcy just rented us a storage locker here at Public Storage on Santa Rosa Avenue. She was very courteous and professional while showing us around the property. She showed me how to apply the really good lock that she suggested I use. I'm very impressed with her quality of service.</Review>

Darcy was incredibly helpful and very professional.  She made a few recommendations to help protect our belongings in a way that wasn't pushy.  In a day and age where people just don't care, I am pleased to say that kindness and professionalism aren't lacking at Public Storage.
Thank you Darcy.< /text>

My husband and I had a great experience with public storage. Crystal was extremely helpful and informative with getting us moved in. The property manager Jennifer so so friendly and made moving out literally a two minute process, which was great after a long day. I highly recommend this location!</review>

My experience @ the Santa Rosa ave. 3491 public storage today made my day. After losing my reservation and being heavily upset and disappointed earlier in the day, I met Darcy and she was able to recapture the reservation which was amazing!!! On top of being completely cordial, kind, and extremely helpful.😁😉 She won my business, she's awesome!!!</Review>

Jennifer is awesome! She is great at customer service and always has a smile on her face. We love seeing her at the bank when she comes in to do deposits. She has made friends with all the tellers and is a joy to help out.<//Review>

The customer service at Public Storage on Santa Rosa Avenue in SR, CA is awesome!  I was there this week and, "Jennifer," was working and she is the greatest...and was really helpful.  I totally recommend this storage place over any of the others...I've had many. It's just so nice to feel like the people you are dealing with at a time when you need help, are real and honest...and will treat you with respect and kindness!

I was in desperate need for a quick place to store some very important and sentimental items while dealing with a death in my family. The manager, Darcy was her name, absolutely went above and beyond to help me during this difficult transition. I instantly felt secure with my items, the cleanliness and security was far surperior to other storage facilities I looked into. I recommend Public Storage highly to anyone needing a safe place to store items and a helpful and polite staff.< /review>

Crystal and Jennifer are amazing. I've changed units 3 times, and they have brought over a dolly to my unit (I hadn't asked) to help me out. Recently I lost my keys and they were understanding and polite about my mistake and helped me through the whole process. Prices are great, too!<//text>< Pics>

Terrific staff at this location, where I recently helped some friends move in and move out.  Jennifer, Asunta, and Bryan were wonderful to deal with - friendly, kind, helpful, calm even when we were not, and very professional.  Moving is such a stressful thing that it was really a gift that we got to be dealing with them.</Review>

< review>
I'm not a big fan of Public Storage as a business. But it does have its pros as well as its cons and some of those are as follows. Pros: 1. long gate hours. 6am to 9 pm. Those are above average for convenience. 2. The units I've seen have all been pretty clean. 3. They have lighting you control inside the units. 4. The height of the ceilings is pretty high. 5.There is a restroom available during office hours. 6. There is actually usually a couple wheeled carts & an upright dolly available for use If needed on site that is easy to find. That's about all I can possibly come up with for the pros. Note that at least a couple of those pros are subject to availability. (ie: last visit the restroom had a "sorry, out of order" sign on it) Now the Cons: 1. THE UNITS ARE WAY OVERPRICED  for our area. For instance in Jan. Of 2019 they charged $189 a month for a 10'x10' w/  drive up access & a rollup door. In addition to that they required a mandatory purchase of insurance on the stuff in the unit. And dictated the type of lock you had to use. Which they conveniently have on hand to sell you.
Just rentwise that's a $100 more per month than a 9'x12' I rent somewhere else nearby. And they don't squeeze you with forced insurance or thier locks. 2. The unit had a damaged door that was bent around the slide bolt lock mechanisim on it. Its a pain in the butt to get it latched. 3. While there may be a gate camera there doesn't appear to be any other security cameras keeping an eye on the rows of units or the fence line. 4. Getting in and out of the place is a bit tight due to narrow drive areas and an oddly placed gate and driveway entrance. Especially when it's busy with people in the units and or you are driving any kind of a large moving truck or van or trailer.
5. The staff I have observed can be judgemental unreasonable, power hungry, busybody controlling tyrants.
For instance, while helping straighten out a large unit poorly & hastily filled. After 3 hours of working on it we took a 45 min break to eat lunch and during that the renter took a 20 min cat nap in the truck. The staff saw him sleeping & accused him of living in the unit and slashed his access hours to the hours the office is open only, for "loitering".
Or a friend who had brought nonalcoholic beers to drink while loading for himself and 2 laborers he hired. Only to find himself pulled over by police just outside the gate when leaving because the staff had called and claimed they saw them getting drunk before driving. WTF! The driver hadn't drunk alcohol in 18 years. They were all sober. Thats just 2 examples.. Theres more I won't bore you with. 6. They don't wanna just do buisness while minding thier own buisness.
7. Don't get me started on the  ridiculousness of the rental contract terms. But most all places have those I guess. My advice. Go rent somewhere else If you have a choice.<//review>

A small damp area, not really a puddle persisted after a rainstorm near the front of my unit. She noticed it because she could, and contacted me immediately to see how my stuff was doing as it could be overflow from an puddle inside. I did and for both our peace of mind, verified the site was minor near the front trickling down from the flashing area and had not gone into the flat floor but stayed on the lower rim. I left her a message back, and she later mentioned how she had inspected the flashing herself. It could have been worse and effected other units and fortunately wasn't, yet action shows me a person who cares about others and cares about doing a good job managing by leading.
She then inspected other places where the flashing was in need of repair to make the roofing secure; so I know if the corporation budgets for maintenance what it should, other occupants will not have to worry either. Thanks Jennifer< /Review>< username>

This is the worst rip-off storage place anywhere! They charged me a whole months' fee because I couldn't get my unit emptied on the 1st of the month - of January!  $130 for one day, that was a holiday so they were closed. Greed greed greed! I'll never use them again - & neither should you, if you value your hard-earned money.< /review>

With the majority of the units costing more than advedtised ,i.e. not reading the fine print. The manager Jennifer Binder explained to me the process of Billing ,rate increases,hours of business etc. in such easy lamen terms I never even needed to ask questions. She did so in an expedient manner. I have been a customer for going on 2 years. Im not sure even if I found the proper housing to move into that I wouldnt keep a unit with Public Storage just for the friendly smiles and hand shakes from Ms.Binder and her emplyees. Thank You.<//Review>< Pictures>

Jennifer at public storage in santa rosa on santa rosa ave was very helpful and helped us figure out how to open the storage safely and directed us on boxes and tapes for our things that we needed stored for awhile. She was also nice and welcoming and warm as well in every way that she could help us out. I would definitly use that company in the future.</Review>

We worked with Thomas on our loan and although many issues came up that we’re out of his control, he jumped through hoops for us. He was creative and persistent, making sure he kept our best financial interests as if they were his own. That is what I really appreciate about Thomas. He is always crunching numbers and making sure you don’t over pay. He is full of knowledge and will guide you in making the best financial decision for your situation.< /review>

The lender, Matt Switzer helped to provide a seamless transaction in regards to my home loan. He was friendly, professional, knowledgeable and very quick to respond to any of my inquiries. He communicated clearly through each step of the process. It also felt like he was fully invested in a positive outcome for me to be able to secure the loan I needed for the house of my dreams. I highly recommend him!< /Review>

Working with Senior Loan Originator Doc Spaulding was an absolute pleasure. He was extremely supportive and ALWAYS available when we needed our questions answered. You would be hard pressed to find anyone as nice, knowledgeable and personable as he was. If you're looking for a loan I highly recommend Doc, you won't be disappointed.<//Text>

Antoine Moore provided excellent guidance throughout our process - the purchase of our 1st home was much easier than we thought it would be. We appreciated the open communication and Antoine definitely went above and beyond to make sure that everything was flowing as it should. We are glad that we went with GEM.< /text>

Silverio is very professional and patient with his customers clients and friends. We asked about buying last year in the fall. He provided us with useful information on what we needed to start the process and what to look forward to. My wife and I told him we weren’t ready at the time. He told us when ever we are ready he’s there. Not one time did he call us to bother or pressure us into the process. Once we called him it was consistent attention to every detail. No matter what time it was, if we had a question he would get back to us. If he had other people he was dealing with he always made sure we still felt like we were his main focus. The way I looked at it being busy speaks for it self. Very kind and honest and will provide you with not only lending services but points of view on the market and time to buy. He makes sure he’s not setting you up for failure. He also has lots of information for after you purchase on how to move forward on just about anything from repairs to small things other people don’t tell you about the process. If you have any questions he’ll answer them and if your just wondering and not ready he won’t bother or bug you. He knows how valuable your time money and future is valued and won’t mess around trying to make a sale. Thank you so much for you and your wife’s professionalism. (By the way his wife’s exactly the same when it comes to finding your dream home” also thank you Yolanda!</review>

Joe will tell you like it is and not like it happens ,reason for that is because conditions change and in the state of this business conditions flex from day to day, with that said experience and knowledge of the flux of these conditions have there various states of meaning .With a straight answer provided by Joe’s straight to the point explanation it becomes a bit more perspective . On top of working with the uniqueness of the individuals placement of what is required for one to be qualified for such a commitment , to make those who seek this journey possible guidance and a play maker  is what you need ! That’s all available when working with Joe Miranda and firm...<//Text>

Silverio was incredibly easy to work with.  Every step of the way for my first mortgage he gave clear instructions and was very responsive, never hesitating to take extra time and answer my questions or concerns during the pandemic. I'm pleased to say the task of buying a house in CA while living in NY wasn't nearly as difficult as I expected, a notary visited me in NY and all the paperwork was taken care of from NY allowing me to move into my house the day I arrived in CA!<//review>

GEM Mortgage is wonderful.  Melissa and Summer have always taken great care of me and everyone that I refer to them.  They are fast and always on top of everything.  Both of them have been doing loans for more than 15 years, so they have seen it all.  They know how to get the best pricing and how to make sure that your loan closes on time.  I recommend them to everyone that is home shopping or doing a refi.  Personally, I have done 2 purchases and 3 refi's with GEM.  I have also recommended them to my parents and my wife's parents.  That is how good they are at what they do!</text>

He wasn’t pushy or insistent, and was very honest about the pros and cons for each option. We also changed our minds a few times and he was very patient and helpful. His team was also very pleasant to communicate with. Despite the SIP order, Eric always made himself available to meet virtually, on the phone, or in person (socially distanced with a mask).

Miracle workers are at Gem Mortgage! Matt and Jen pulled off the loan of a lifetime in record time! These two people worked around the clock to make sure our experience with them was positive, smooth and timely! They were professional, knowledgeable and kind! We felt like we were their top priority! Phone calls or emails were returned quickly, they were transparent with us about every detail, and they helped us find the best loan that worked for our needs! We could not have asked for a better loan experience than with Gem Mortgage! We are grateful for Matt and Jen! Thanks to all of their hard work we got our dream home! 💕</Review>

I can't describe enough how appreciative I am of GEM Mortgage and especially MELISSA SPARKS!!!!
My Family and I moved from Maui, HI back to So Cal and Melissa worked so hard to make it happen. She was so informative, advising me on what documents I needed to gather in advance, provided great options on financing. Through the process of purchasing my new home, I kept thinking it wouldn't happen....too good to be true. MELISSA never let me lose faith, she stayed positive and kept me motivated. If you're looking for someone to be dedicated from the start, care about your interests and make purchasing a new home a reality, call MELISSA SPARKS with GEM 💎  MORTGAGE! She and her awesome Team will make it happen! Thanks again! Forever grateful!< /review>

I have been taking my loans to them for over twenty years, they’re honest, work diligently and apply attention to detail.

< review>
Not good service, It was Great Service,. that is what I received from Gem Mortgage under Cynthia MacNaugton and her whole team.  Cynthia worked very diligent to make sure i got the best deal available for my personal situation and kept on top to make sure i wouldn't lost any of the savings available.  I want to tank her and her team for their prompt follow ups if some change, in my case it change a few times but their prompt response avoided me to loose great opportunity in my refinance.
Thank you again and I will definitely recommend your services to my family and friends.  Great Job.</review>

<text>Don't second guess.  Call Gem Mortgage.   They came from nowhere and they got me a low APR that I referred several people to them.  I was helped by Cristina Zepeda.

George has been so helpful and easy to work with during our entire refi process. His communication skills and effectiveness in explaining every step of this process during our refi helped us to understand everything that was going on and needed on our parts, as well as know that we were in great and caring hands. George was on top of it throughout the whole process and helped us get our refi in a timely manner. He's been a pleasure to work with and we are forever grateful to him and Gem Mortgage!</text>

From the moment I first spoke to Jeff, he showed a commitment to getting us a home. A commitment I had not noticed with any other lender up until that point. I could trust the advice Jeff was giving me was sound and thought out. I had a very pleasant experience working with Jeff on our first home loan, and would definitely recommend him to anyone looking into buying a home.< /text>

The Maurice and Cristina team exceed my expectations. We got a lower rate than we were quoted by another lender and they saved us over $2500 in closing costs. Their lever of service is exceptional. As a busy agent, I work with a lot of lenders, but I choose Maurice and Cristina to my personal loans and recommend them to our clients.<//text>

This wasn’t an easy refi By no means. We had to over come some barriers; deed issues and a Lein issue. Esmeralda and the title staff made it possible. She is hard working, great communication skills and most importantly genuinely cares about her customers. Thank you for allowing me to work with her.</text>

Dan and his team were professional, kind, diligent, resourceful and took the time to answer any questions we had. As novices, we were definitely overwhelmed and had no idea what a lot of terms meant, but again, Dan was quick to explain everything in detail and felt valued along the way. We highly recommend Dan to help you will all your needs when planning to buy a home. Start with an initial consultation to see where you currently stand, get pre-approved and funded! Thank you GEM Mortgage!</Text>

This is the second time we have worked with HMS/GEM and a fantastic experience each time. Professional, educational and most of all, low rates with no surprises. I encourage anyone to compare other lenders to HMS/GEM and you will find out who the clear winner of your business will be. The commercials are worth listening to and making the call.<//Review>

<text>Excellent service, even in this very busy time of refinancing, I always felt like the only client they had.  Highly recommend Mark While and Nancy Ranger for new loans, or refis.  They are the best in town, kind, thoughtful and always available when I call.< /text>< Pictures>

I represented the seller, who wanted a quick close.  The buyer was a VA and his lender was stating a 40 day close.  The buyer ended up using GEM and we were able to close in 23 days! They were quick, efficient, and closed ahead of time.  Thank you!</Review>

Ryan Moss was always very communicative throughout my home buying process, and he always took the time to explain things in detail, and over again! I think that's what separates him from every other lender out there. The care he gives to his clients is his top priority and it shows. I would recommend him to anyone I know who is looking to buy a home!<//review>

After having worked with Mark White at GEM Mortgage to secure my first home loan and having a positive experience, I chose to work with him again when going through the process of refinancing my condo. As someone who is brand new to the world of refinance, I appreciated all of the time Mark took to answer questions (sometimes repeatedly if I was still confused!), his consistently timely responses, and generosity with his time to make sure I understood and felt comfortable every step of the way.< /text>

Having a knowledgeable and “upbeat” person, such as yourself, to not only provide the professional mortgage related services necessary, but to provide them with sensitivity, motivation, patience and a true sense of wanting to insure every aspect of the process is done thoroughly and correctly the first time, has been reassuring and received as a true blessing considering the multitude of tasks required and challenges at hand.<//review>

I called Joseph and the team to get some info on a refinance. Before I knew it I was in the process of refinancing at a rate I could have only dreamed of. By far the easiest process I've ever been through. They were all so knowledgable and friendly. I highly recommend giving them a call. I've already recommended them to all my family and friends.< /text>

<text>If you want an easy (really) and worry free mortgage process contact GEM Mortgage in Ontario. I can't use enough superlative's to describe the mortgage application, approval and finalization process that Josue and Diana helped me with such professionalism and dedication.

This is the first such process I have done where everything worked out perfect, from the timeline to the closing procedures, the top notch communication and everything in-between. Most definitely give them a try if you're reading this and is considering applying for a mortgage. You will come back to this review later and thank me for it.< /text><Rate>5</Rate>< Resp>

<Review>My wife and I were dabbling with the idea of buying a house and were kind of on the fence because of the market. We were referred to Thomas and his team by a friend and had MANY questions about the VA Loan, payments, escrow, etc... Thomas was suuuuper patient and literally broke it down for us. He was always so professional and prompt in finding us the info we needed. I couldn't have had a better experience buying a home through him and his team. As a first time buyer I was nervous, but Thomas made the experience so painless.

From the moment you step into his office, he makes you feel like family. He's very transparent and won't give you the run around. Expect him to be honest with you (don't be sorry if you can't handle the truth). I had a lot of questions about the VA loan and he enlightened me on so many things I didn't even know I qualified for.

Overall, I would ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND Thomas and his team to anyone considering buying a home. Throughout the process, we really felt like we were in good hands. My wife and I are happy to call him a friend.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80ea421ce86f0497:0x5b5afa077475a774< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I received a letter in the mail stating that HMS Capital (Gem Mortgage) could likely refinance my loan for like to no costs. I generally throw away such mailings but decided to call and that's exactly what happened- refi for no costs. Joseph Giffoni was my loan officer. I am extremely pleased and saving a substantial amount each month.</text>< Pictures>

Five stars for Toni Bullard! She was great to work with. She went above and beyond what I expected a loan officer to do. Very thorough and knowledgeable. Never met her before and just felt so familiar like family. This definitely will NOT be the last time we do business with her. Will absolutely recommend her to friends and family.</Text>

This is my second time doing business with Mary Vera. She is very professional and knowledgeable in her business, made the process very smooth and she is always is there for you to answer any questions you may have and goes out of her way.
I refer to Mary as a the miracle maker because if she can’t do it I definitely know no one can, I will definitely recommend her and know that when my daughters are ready to purchase a home they can’t count on her.
Thank you Mary Vera and you will always have my business.< /Text>

Mary Vera is amazing at what she does best! She along with her realtor Tiffany will help you find your dream home like she has done so for my family. Unlike the previous person who tried to help us with our loan, Mary made sure to keep contact daily or weekly with any questions or updates. She made buying a house seem pretty simple. Thank you so much Mary!<//Text>

Annie and her team at All Pacific / Gem Mortgage helped us finance a new home. (in a new state) what otherwise is a very stressful scenario was actually much smoother than we’d anticipated. I believe it’s primarily because Annie and her team were well organized, communicated excellent and remained friendly and positive throughout the process. Looking forward to refinancing with her down the road. So yes, highly recommend her and the service they provided us.<//Text>

<Text>Manuel and his team were amazing! Extremely knowledgeable and professional.  Feel confident in your realestate experience and go see the best! He will prepare you for success.  Many people do loans, but Manuel gives you real advice and demonstrates the pros and cons involved with every option. My wife and I couldn't be happier with our experience.  We will go see Manuel again for future loan needs.<//Text>< name>

Melissa and Summer at GemMortgage took great care in understanding my target and relating to my financial expectations. They were always present and great communicators. I especially appreciated their ability in relating  all information needed for my loan as well as tailoring and balancing options for my timing and market.< /review>

<text>Rene is the best in his field. I’ve never met someone with his kind of work ethic! He goes above and beyond even now that we have been closed for 5 months he still asks how everything is going and he still offers his help day or night if we need it. He definitely puts customers first. Don’t waste your time with anyone else, Rene from GEM mortgage is your best friend in the real estate world< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<text>Patricia Chavez waved her magic wand and made it possible for me to own a home! Actually, she patiently explained things to me, probably many times over, so that I understood the process. I feel confident in her competence, but I would go one step further and say that she's brilliant!<//text>< pics>

<Review>My husband and I not only have a place to call our new home but our home that we officially own! We had this thought in order to buy a home we needed thousands upon thousands upon thousands of dollars and owning a home would be some thing to attain in 3-5 years! We were informed that’s not true and in fact we could own a place within a “X” amount of days! I was nervous, he put my mind at ease, we had questions, he answered ALL OF THEM, I needed information past business hours and Thomas was kind enough to take my calls. What I appreciated the most was that even though they’re located in LA/ San Bernardino Country, and my family and I live in San Diego,  they were still able to help us!! Thank you Thomas and staff from Gem Mortgage. You just helped us start a new chapter of our life as Husband , Wife, Daughter and new baby boy coming this November!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Jennifer when above and beyond to help me have a great experience in the refinanced area. For instance she drove me to the IRS, to help me pay off my unusually high debt. I was unable to drive that day because of my health issues and she so gracefully accepted the  Challenge. She drove me there and back to get the job done 3 hours. I would gladly do business with her again and recommend her to everyone and their family. I now consider her a friend.<//Review>

<Review>Mark was recommended to me for being AMAZING! I have nothing but great things to say. Mark took the time to review my credit and give me advise on a to-do list. In 30 days, I was pre-qualified and I have purchased my home! Mark really listened to my situation, my expectations and was able to put together a plan and review my options. I was able to communicate with him at anytime. Mark... Thank you!!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>It is a pleasure to work with highly knowledgeable people such as Alan Mellor. We had contemplated to buy house for months and we had no luck getting financed. We met Alan and our lives changed for the better. Alan’s expertise in the mortgage world makes a huge difference for us regular folks that have no idea when and where to take the first step. We appreciate Alan’s parience and guidance throughout the whole process. We are happy to say we are homeowners now and it’s all thanks in part to Alan and his team.< /review>< pics>

Brian Weide is one of the best Mortgage Brokers in Southern California.
Brian is very ethical, honest and straight forward.
This was one of the smoothest and fastest Mortgage transaction experiences I have ever had.

We worked with Tim Roberts to help us finance and plan for the purchasing of our first home. We went in knowing almost nothing about what steps we needed to take and Tim was there with us the whole time guiding us and helping us along the way .He always had our back and supported what we wanted to do, not trying to force anything us. Thanks Tim!< /Review>

I have been a home owner for many years, but it wasn't until working with Manny, that I learned so much about real estate. He educated me during the process using visual ppt presentations, when it was time to make decisions, he informed me using different scenarios, and me being so busy, I love they are so technology and user friendly. He is the best and most kind person in this business, and it was an absolute pleasure working with him, Valerie Monterroso and the team. Thank you!!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>We refinenced our home in Newark, CA with Mary Vera who helped us through the whole process. She was quick at answering any questions we had through phone call and email. We had a great experience working with her and will turn to her with any future home purchasing and refinancing. I trust her fully!

John Trujillo is an AWESOME loan agent. Help helped us repair our credit and get into the home we chose. He kept in contact with us about every detail. We never felt lost or left in the dark. John went above and beyond his job discription to ensure we got into a home and in less than 60 days. We came to John through ways of our real estate agent Donna Sontya,they make a great pair to get you the home you are looking for and fast. I beleive there is no road block strong enough to stop John from getting someone the home they want. Again John is AWESOME 😁😁😁😁<//text>

Silverio and his team made my home buying process easy. He was available day and night for my questions, even when I texted my concerns/questions after business hours. He offered me something that other companies couldn't-UPFRONT MORTGAGE PAYMENT- to get rid of PMI on the entire life of the loan, saving me thousands. That's huge!!! I hear that home buying is stressful but this process was smooth! I am very thankful!!<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I have to be seriously honest.

Pat Mulvey was able to refianance my home

& has made me debt free. She got me a low

interest rate and did all of this in a very quick

manner. My wife had recently passed away

and Pat and her Team @ Gem Mortgage were

able to help me stabilize my finances

considering the fallout from my wifes passing

and our combined income.
Sincerely
I want to thank everyone involved with the process. I truly appreciate all that you did for me & my family.  Thankyou very much!
