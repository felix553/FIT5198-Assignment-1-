Absolutely terrible service. Employees talked amongst themselves while I stood there waiting to order. When‚Äôs the girl did finally ask what I wanted she talked so quiet I couldn‚Äôt even hear her. No thank you, no have a nice day, no personality.</text>

I always get the chocolate dipped cone! They have this limited time strawberry cheese cake ice cream that goes nicely with my dipped cone. Highly recommend this place the employees are friendly and eager to help. They also let you sample all the ice cream you want to make sure you get what you are really craving for!<//Review>

I was a employee here and when I started this place was disgusting bugs in the icecream, old cakes, dust and grim everywhere, the new owners were very sexist and shorted my checks after putting in a two weeks due to me crying everyday I went home I was fired instead for no reason. I went in today and its back to being very very gross I do not reccomend eating here the icecream is also expired as I personally was a manager and tried to fix this problem with the owners since I kept getting sick along with several others there so cheap they didnt care! Sodas and other items also expired I reccomend the other store if your seaking baskin robbins icecream! Do not support the disrespect they put towards there employees as they dont even pay these kids minimum wage no wonder theres so many bad reviews it relates to bad owners! So greatful I got outta there while I did</Text>

<Review>This B.R has friendly and kind staff, with a great array of flavors.
Try to avoid this shop during peak hours however, as the small staff and store size damage their ability to give great service during those times.< /Review><name>Billy cop32</name><Rating>4<//Rating><resp>None</resp></record>

Came here on a Saturday night after we were denied service at the Baskin Robbins on nut tree and Alamo. The teenage employee there was rude and unprofessional.
The two young men at this location were friendly, courteous, and efficient on a very busy evening. We will be back to this location. Thanks guys.<//Text>

<text>I'm a little late on this review (about 3 months) life has been hectic but couldn't pass up writing about my experience. Wendy was AMAZING to work with. She went above and beyond my expectations. I was with my pevious insurance company for 17 years (left on good terms, not issues or complaints) but for me customer service SPEAKS VOLUMES and that's exact what was provided. Great, prompt and excellent service.<//text></record>

<text>After a horrific incident at a different agency, I was desperate to switch to a more reliable Farmers Insurance office. I called the office a while back, and Alexis, a super friendly auto agent, helped me do the most effortless transition. Alexis walked me through all the steps, made sure I could save more on discounts, and provided exceptional customer service! Susie, the life agent, was terrific and extremely patient! I had acquired life insurance quotes for the family, and she made the whole process a piece of cake! She was very knowledgeable about what she was doing and answered all of our questions in areas we were confused. Rene, the customer service representative, left me in shock. I had never experienced this best top-notch guest service at an insurance office before. I called in asking a couple questions, and he told me to rest assured he would call me the next morning for an update. That very next morning, he was ready with all the answers I asked for and even walked me through filling out some paperwork Farmers requested. He did not end that phone call until he made sure I was satisfied with the service provided. Alexis, Wendy, and Rene went above and beyond, ensuring I was happy and feeling I was in good hands. This office truly values its customers, and would no doubt recommend this agency to friends! Thank you for all you do! Alex get these staff a raise, they earned it !</text>< pics>

<Text>It was several years ago that I was looking for vehicle insurance, and I happened to find the phone number for Nunez Insurance Agency. I live in Northern California, the agency is in Southern California. I didn‚Äôt  see any problem, Farmers has offices everywhere. Without knowing it at the time, that moment has proven to be a defining moment. The first voice I heard was not a machine, it was Susie Sandoval. Taken by surprise, I explained that I needed auto insurance. She made it so easy and calm. I have called countless times over many years now, and I get help very similar. This team works with each other. But Susie has been with me every step of the way, through, cars, motorcycles, and we‚Äôve even looked at options for home and life insurance. Susie knows us, it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs a friend. And she always makes transitions easy. If there is some small increase in the price we pay by choosing this firm, it‚Äôs well worth it. The customer service is second to none.</Text>< Pictures>

I signed up with Farmers through Susie. From start to finish, Susie is a 5 Star Agent. She is very responsive to any questions or concerns I have and she is great at figuring out what policies fit best for your family status and income, giving you the best policies that you can afford. She has absolutely surpassed all expectations & I am grateful for her. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for insurance. She takes care of what‚Äôs most important to you.</Review>

If you want a great deal for car insurance and renters insurance Farmers is definitely the way to go. I have had their insurance for over a year and they have taken care of me in every way imaginable. Thank you so much Farmers Insurance for your help and support. They are quick and simple. Their app is very convenient and simple also.<//review>

I have my home insurance with Alex Nunez Farmers Insurance.  They have been fantastic.  I was a fist time home buyer and they were very patient with me getting everything set up and taken care of.  They explained how everything worked and made sure I understood fully rather than just brushing things to the side.  They were very easy to work with and have always made sure I had all the coverage I needed.  I would recommend them to anyone.< /review>

I love these guys. There genuinely care about protecting you and your property.  They are friendly, yet profession in all their interactions. They are knowledgeable about all of their products and they will research any scenario you may have to deal with. They are also proactive in their efforts to keep you fully covered all the time.   So if it's auto, motorhome, motorcycle, home, rental, life or liability insurance, Alex Nunez Agency deserves your consideration and patronage.<//Review>

I would like to say that I'm very happy to have gotten my life insurance with the help of Wendy and Rene. Wendy was very accommodating; I work around La Brea so I get home very late. We had a 7:30pm appointment and it shows that this team is dedicated to their job and is willing to meet later in the day. Wendy made the process go smoothly and answered any questions my family and I had. I would definitely recommend meeting with the agents at this location!< /Text>

Just wanted to shout out my amazing insurance agent Wendy Trejo. I appreciate her efficiency, professionalism, her ability to help me out every time I have a question about something and even if she doesn‚Äôt have the answer (which is rare) she‚Äôll point me in the right direction. It‚Äôs not often you find a person like her in the insurance world. I recommend her to all my family and friends. Thanks for all your help Wendy, I love working with you!< /Text>

A few moments later I'm saving over 30% with better coverage AND renters insurance! Incredible team, and I would highly recommend for anyone that values service, their time and savings.

If they are busy and the call goes to voicemail, they do a great job in returning phone calls on the same day! Thank you Nu√±ez Insurance Agency for your great service.

I've been  with farmers and the nu√±ez agency for a few years now, I've been involved in one minor fender-bender, and my daughter has been involved in an accident, in both occasions, everything has been taken care of immediately I really like how their first question when we call is "are you all right" what can we do for you, it makes me feel like they care about you you're not just a statistic to them and it's that great service that keeps me here!< /Text>

I have life insurance with Alex at Farmer's. When I first went there to get enrolled, Alex met with me and went over difference options and explained everything to me. We found the best plan for me and my two children as a single parent. He made sure the monthly payments would be affordable while still having me on a good plan. I've had it for a few years and it's set up as a direct deposit so I don't even have to think about it. Every year I have to pay a separate amount for one of my kids and I almost always seem to forgot to mail it in. Hahaha. However, my absentmindedness doesn't matter because I can easily call in to make the payment with no hassle. If I ever have any questions either Alex or someone at the office is happy to answer it. They also offer other meetings to go over your plan in a new unit of time to make sure it's still the right plan for you since your life could change, warranting an adjustment to your plan. I sometimes forget I'm even enrolled because it's so easy and is just something in the back of my mind that I know is there should something happen. Love this business!<//Review>

I recently got my Auto insurance with Wendy Trejo, and I must say her service and attention was something I've NEVER experienced in the past with other carriers. I was recommended to switch to Farmers (agent Wendy) by a familiar member. It was the best desicion I could of made ! I used to have state farm and Wendy saved me a lot of money. She explained my coverages in detail and her service was just amazing. I definitely recommend her, you won't be disappointed :)<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I have recently been learning about crystals and was looking if there was any crystal shops near me. I came upon this one so I went. When I went inside I was stunned. Even thought the store was small it was   just so beautiful. I didn‚Äôt get the chance to ask for her name but there was a lady working there and she was so nice. The lady was so sweet and helped me learn some of the properties and meaning of some crystals I was attracted too. If you are into crystals I definitely recommend coming here. The store is so beautiful and have such a huge variety of crystals! Definitely recommend coming here and this will now be my go to crystal store!!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>Gary's has been in business forever! Which tells me they must be doing something right! While I've never met Gary the lady (wife?) who runs  the store is very knowledgeable about beads, rocks, stones, silver, anything it seems she knows her business. It  has a very laid  back atmosphere and she is super nice. I hate to keep calling her "the lady", but never asked her her name. She makes lovely jewelry and helped me out one time years back with a beading question I had. We are very lucky to have this little gem of a store in our area!< /text><user_name>Samuella Ramsey<//user_name>< Response>

< Review>
I've been going there for sometime & getting my Native American craft's stuff. Like my beads & bones & different kinds of other stones & whatever else I need & I can truly say that this is the one & only best jewelry store around! Very honest people & knowledgeable about all of their stones & gems & all of their other products! I give them 5 Stars thank you very much.</Review>

<Text>It's great, if you're into gemstones and semiprecious stones. I've been going there for over 20 years, the prices are real good. I love going there and my family does too. The store is small but there is a lot to see. The owner is very knowledgeable on all the different stones and making jewelry. I always send my family and friends there. I have a really nice collection of Quartz crystals that I've purchased over the years from there. :)<//Text><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>BEST KEPT SECRET IN THE VALLEY, OR AT LEAST EAST VISALIA.  I HAVE HAD MANY ITEMS REPAIRED AND THE QUALITY IS FANTASTIC AND THEY ARE CHEAP.  I COULDN'T DO THESE REPAIRS AT A REGULAR JEWELERS.  I LEAVE STUFF TILL THE FOLLOWING MONTH SO THERE'S NO HURRY FOR ME.  IF YOU WANT A QUICK TURN AROUND I AM NOT SURE HOW FAST THEY DO AS THEY ARE SO BUSY ALWAYS AT SHOWS AND ALL.  BUT I LOVE EVERY REPAIR AND I AM ON A SM FIXED INCOME SO IF I SAY THEY ARE CHEAP THEY ARE. NICE PEOPLE.   THE SHOP IS A ROCK HOUNDS DREAM.  THEY ARE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE TOO.  THEY DO NOT CHANGE WATCH BATTERIES I JUST FOUND OUT.  BUT ANYTHING ELSE THEY CAN DO.</review><GmapID>0x80953025c6aa3991:0x52735becf1143e72<//GmapID>< user_id>

Found exactly what I was looking for! Great customer service to boot. Fyi, they will size jewelry, set stones and make jewelry with stone of your specifications. Really great find in a town with few options for holistic/metaphysical shops.</review>

This was the most I had with any training. Jay will give you that bit of extra confidence you will need to get the job done. His nack for explanation is top notch.  Also you'll learn concepts here you won't anywhere else.
Totally worth it. Thanks Jay.</Text>

American forklift training, so I took a course here with no prior experience. Thanks to Jay he is very helpful and informative. I was a bit nervous at first but Jay patiently helped me step by step with fun games that helps you learn the steps and later I'm a certified OSHA forklift operator. I went with no knowledge now I operate a forklift like If had years of experience. But Jay was a very good instructor. And he was very informative. I would recommend this place to others< /Text>

<Review>Went to this office a few days ago needed to open more options for myself, and i thought a forklift license would be a good idea. Only problem was I didnt have the slightest clue or idea about forklifts. But Jay, he made the learning process very easy and entertaining, which also helped with a lot of the information to stick. I highly recommended the classes here you wont be disappointed!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><GmapID>0x80c2ce0d84cb6b29:0x622fa19a88d250ac< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I went to American Forklift this past weekend to get certified and boy let me say, I highly recommend American Forklift to anyone or anyone they know that is looking to renew or to get there forklift license for the first time to come check them out. Well worth it. There very professional, place is nice and kept clean, they get straight to the point with the training, they help you look for work if needed, but most importantly to me, you get treated with respect as soon as you walk in the door. Big thumbs up to Jay for making it all happen. So again don't waste your time looking at all the other places and just come to American Forklift, you will not be let down. -Chris H.</text>

Jay‚Äôs methods of teaching are extremely helpful when coming in with no experience. He makes the class a warm and welcoming environment with the right amount of humor. I came in on a busy day and Jay went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable on the equipment.</review>

I had a great experience here. Jamal is a great guy he actually stayed after hours just to make sure i got the training down packed. I got my certificate for sit down, stand up, stand up reach, and stand up. They also send your resume to different companies and you should start getting calls by the next week. Overall great experience.</review>

Our company received reasonably priced, on-site lift truck training and licensing for 3 employees from American Forklift.  Jamal agreed to our short notice request, and responded thoroughly and professionally, arriving at our site early and staying late to ensure our drivers were trained and competent.   I don't see how our needs could have been better met, and I'm happy to recommend him whenever I get the chance.</text>

<Review>The instructor was awesome at making the class easy. He was very attentive with me and took his time to make sure I learned all the gears, and safety procedures. It shows they really care about the students and their futures. They give you as much time as you need so you'll be confident in driving a forklift. They offer different types of forklift training and at an affordable price. If you are looking for a school to teach you right, this is the place. I'm very happy with them. I'll be back in a year to renew my license.< /Review></record>

<Review>My son, BRANDON, attended the 1st forklifting class with JAMAL at American Forklift, and he said it was a great learning experience and was happy to walk out with his OSHA Certification!  He said JAMAL was nice and very encouraging and patient and even tried to help him personally by talking to him about projecting himself with confidence!  My son intends to take the other forklifting classes here when he can!  Every bit of this was a great learning experience!  Thank you, Jamal!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I was really impressed with the instructor Jay, he was very professional and had excellent communication skills, he was very patient and made me feel very comfortable. His teaching skils are 5 star, he was able to instill a greater level of confidence in me. Through his teaching I am more confident in operating the different forklifts mechaninery. I can now apply what I learned from jay's class and seek employment as a certified forklifts driver. I RECOMMEND anyone seeking training and certification at learning to drive and operate any forklift, American Forklift Training Center  is the best way to go.</Review>

Not only does he teach you virbally but also teaches you visually and allows you to train each other within ur class. Highly recommend for anywho who is looking for their certification. ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è</Review><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I super recommend this place, I had all my certifications expired, no job and still searching for a lift job and luckily I was hire by Michael Kors. Please go visit this place if you need to renew or want to get a better paying warehouse job driving any lift. The prices are so reasonable, the person in charge has a great friendly attitude that you won't hesitate to get your license here. The only money I had on me, I invested in my licensing and now I get paid 5 dllrs more than my base minimum wage were I work. So go visit my friend at AFTC in commerce and get license and get a raise pay workning doing lift at your next new warehouse job. Tell him that Enrique Garcia recommend you here and if he says who's Enrique...tell him the guy with the bit up blue mustang!!! He will know right away...take care guys!! ..and Thank you AFTC for your great reasonable services!!< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1546721963099, 'text': "Thank you for your 5 star review and choosing American Forklift Training Centers Inc.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) Jay is a good trainer. Jay guides thoughtfulness, ensuring you will be satisfied before receiving the certificate. The class consists of two parts. First you will see a video about safety when using a folklift car and at the same time complete a test while watching a video to prove you have an understanding of the safety rules when using the car. Then the practical part. Jay will thoroughly introduce all parts of the car and explain any questions. Then you will test drive and practice until you get used to driving the car. If you have a request, Jay will send your information to more than 72 job placement centers, so that you receive an invitation to work as soon as possible. I highly recommend to train with Jay, he's the best.

(Translated by Google) The boss and coach are both the same stylish Jay. The person is not only interesting, but also very teachable. The language is very vivid and vivid. He advocates concept teaching, which is to let you learn how to concentrate, so no matter which brand it is Forklift can pass Belden. Great! Also, if you can understand a little English, you will learn better!

<Text>(Translated by Google) I recommend this school to everyone who wants to be a forklift driver. I had an owesome experience in this school. Guys ask for Jay. He was very patient and he took his time teaching his students. They also send forklift drivers to 75 work agencies and that is a plus plus from this school.

This and the recommended school for those who want to learn forklift driving. What a wonderful experience in this school. Ask Jay if you ever enroll in this school. They also have 75 agencies that can get jobs as forklift drivers. They are very good to teach and trainer here. Name is Jay. Just to speak english and spanish.

Ito and recomendadong eskuwelahan para sa mga gustong matuto ng forklift driving. Napakagandang experience sa school na ito. Tanungin si Jay pag sakaling mag enroll kayo sa eskuwelang ito. Meron din silang 75 na ahensya na pwedeng makakuha ng trabaho bilang forklift drivers. Napakagaling magturo and trainer nila dito. Pangalan ay Jay. Basta marunong sa ingles at espanyol.<//Text>< user_name>

(Translated by Google) Jay, is a patient instructor, he takes his time to explain what is necessary in a theoretical and practical way, I came without knowing anything about forklifts and finished the day learning to use 3 teams, plus you can practice for more than 45 minutes to master the techniques of security and management.

(Original)

They run a very efficient business. There are multiple departments that gets you in and out of there quickly and efficiently. I was able to get right away. They have the latest technology so it felt painless. Katherine Chen, M.D. was also helpful in resolving my concerns. Thank you!< /Review>

<Review>Glendale Eye has been the best medical experience I‚Äôve had in ages.  Every single staff member I‚Äôve come in contact with, from doctors to transportation has been top notch.  When there was a last minute mixup about my surgery time and I was freaking out about it, the staff jumped to get things resolved.  Everyone there is knowledgeable, friendly and compassionate.......Special thanks to Dr. Paul - my eyesight is restored!  And much, much appreciation for the angel Annabel A., Nurse Beverly and Claudina.<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1571177357474, 'text': 'Thank you Joan for your kind words!'}</Resp></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>As usual I received excellent and professional care from Glendale Eye.  I have been going here for examinations for close to 30 years and have always received thorough and excellent care.  Dr. Wang is one of the best.  She is always very thorough, professional and courteous and pleasant.  Her calm demeanor always puts you at ease.  Her assistant, Catherine (I think that is her name) is also excellent.  I would recommend Glendale Eye and although I have moved out of the area I will always go here for examinations.  My only complaint has nothing to do with Glendale Eye but has to do with the parking.</Text>< Pics>

The staff is professional, efficient, patient and cordial, while the doctors instill confidence and provide the very best care possible.  Most highly recommended for anyone who seeks and requires the best care for their eyes.</Review>< pictures>

Outstanding care and very thorough examination.  Their optical dispensary on the first floor has excellent personnel to help choosing an appropriate pair of glasses and fitting them.  I was very impressed.< /review>

Dr. Marta Recasens is an absolute professional. Before I sing her praises, however, I need to provide some background regarding how I came into her care.

Roughly six months ago, I started hemorrhaging in my right eye. I soon discovered that my diabetes was out of control. Ten years of neglect had finally caught up with me. In my haste to resolve the issue, I searched online and found an ophthalmologist nearby. As it turns out, I would soon regret my decision. The ophthalmologist attempted to perform laser eye treatment without checking my blood glucose level and the result was a bruised cheek from an injection and pronounced double vision that persist to this day.

About a week later, after I had finally visited a doctor for the first time in 12 years, I was referred to Dr. Marta Recasens. I struggle to put into words how grateful I am to Dr. Recasens for all that she has done for me. Dr. Recasens immediately took charge of my case and made absolutely certain that my diabetes was under control before starting a series of eye treatments.

As I type this, I am on the road to recovery. The hemorrhaging has stopped and eyesight is clearer. The double vision caused by the other doctor has also subsided substantially. I do not subscribe to the notion of guardian angels, but Dr. Recasens comes pretty close. She is kind and gentle and absolutely no nonsense. Dr. Recasens will make certain that you know exactly what the situation with your vision is. She also has a gentle hand for the more delicate procedures.

I most highly recommend Dr. Recasens if you are looking for an ophthalmologist who is compassionate and professional. I also recommend her if you harbor any fear and anxiety regarding medical procedures. Dr. Recasens and her wonderful staff will put you at ease.
Thank you, Dr. Recasens.

- Andrew M.< /text>

<Response>None< /Response><Rating>5</Rating><Text>Having been around opthomalogy long before the Glendale Eye Medical Group became the practice that it now is and associated with its progenitors as well, it would be most difficult to find any collection of ophthomalogists better qualified to treat eye diseases of all kinds, as well as the very important aspect of exacting refractions, than the doctors who comprise the Glendale Eye Medical Group.  In the County of Los Angeles, Glendale has long been a major medical center, a claim which can be documented back into the 1930's.  The doctors in the Glendale Eye Medical Group are comparable to or surpass easily in professional competence  any which may be found in Southern California including the Doheny group at USC.  It should always be remembered that in any area of medicine, there are doctors and, then, there are doctors.  The M.D.'s at Glendale Eye Medical Group stand out head and shoulders in the latter group just cited.  Not only has this been a source of continuing satisfaction to me, it has been very successful for my wife who has had to deal with some delicate optical problems as well.  One can hardly do better in Southern California.</Text></record>

Hello There<//username>

I have only been going to this group for the past 3 or so years.  I was referred to Dr. Darlington (by the doctor who did my cataract surgery) when a friend needed Cataract Surgery. She thought that she was going permanently blind .  Dr. Darlington did a complete examination and explained that it was only severe cataracts.  He put my friend at ease and returned her sight to her in short order.  Everyone, including Dr. Darlington was so good to my friend.  Since I was working, they arranged for transportation to and from my home (close by in Glendale) before and after the surgery. I now count on Dr. Darlington and Dr. Drexl for my eye care.  The support staff is excellent too!

The new offices are great but I was always amazed at how they kept track of us in the old building - in the maze of rooms.  Now the maze of rooms are in long hallways organized to be as efficient as possible.< /text>

< review>
One of the best experience I‚Äôve had at a dental office.The min a walk in was greeted by Gabby their office manager she was very kind.RDA Erica was accommodating, sweet and caring.The hygienist Gen was  amazing, cleaning was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had, felt my teeth squeaky clean. If your looking for a honest dentist and professional I recommend you come and see Dr.Darabi extremely knowledgeable answer every question I had thoroughly. They go above and beyond with all the service they provide. Overall Hands üôå down best dental office, left very pleased happy I found this dental office.< /review>

<Text>Extremely welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable. The front office is polite and respectful of your time. The doctor takes the time to answer your questions and put your mind at ease as to what is about to happen. She listened to my concerns and did not push me into making difficult decisions. Lastly she does not rush off to the next patient like some other dentist.< /Text>< pictures>

They have a new team that‚Äôs fantastic.  Gabby was a friendly prompt receptionist!  She‚Äôs very on it.

Gen is the new hygienist and she‚Äôs such a sweetheart!   She was extremely thorough but totally personable.  I felt like I was talking to someone styling my hair not cleaning my teeth.

Love this place and happy to recommend it even more for their service during this crazy COVID time!<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I recently moved here and found myself facing the difficult task of finding a dentist. On my first visit I knew this was the right place because Dr. Darabi and her staff are so kind, professional and honest. They were even able to work with my insurance company to find the best rates for the treatments I needed done. I highly recommend you give them a try.<//Review>

Let me start off with how amazing it is to see all women staff! Then let me tell you about how friendly and uplifting these women are! If you have ever been self-conscience of your smile these women know how to uplift you and you are in GREAT hands! If you have trouble finding a dentist that cares about your needs, stop looking, she is here at Glassell Dental and her name is Dr. Darabi! She and her lovely lady staff care about what YOUR needs are and on top of that, they prioritize your needs based on what YOU want to be done first! I needed work done on my back teeth but my chipped and decaying front tooth was more important to me for obvious reasons. Dr. Darabi and her wonderful team did not hesitate to put that first as they knew that's what was first on MY list. Even more, they get so enthusiastic on every smile they help because behind that smile is a person, not a dollar sign and they see that! Thank you so much ladies!!!!!<//Text>

<Text>If I could give Glassell Dental ten stars, I ABSOLUTELY would. I can't even begin to describe how amazing Dr. Darabi and her team were while I went in for a series of appointments. I've had horrible experiences in the past but now look forward to my visits. I had a deep cleaning, a couple of crowns and fillings done and Dr. Darabi and Erika took great care of me. They knew my anxiety about getting dental work done and helped me through it. If you or anyone you know has hesitations about going to the dentist I would highly recommend checking out Glassell Dental.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1610604801809, 'text': 'Thank you Erica.'}<//response><gmapID>0x80dcd9e0c01c14e7:0x481c0ef9e0cef1c9</gmapID></record>

By far the very best experience I have ever had while sitting in a Dentist chair. Extremely kind, comforting, and welcoming staff. I had two extractions done the staff walked me through this process step by step, and I have very minimal pain or discomfort. Thank You all so very much!< /Review>

<review>THIS REQUEST IS ONLY FOR ERICA.
Talk about a hidden gem, with the nicest staff ever. I don't know why or how i have been going through my dental life, but I HATE DENTISTS they terrified me and I never felt like they cared. But Erica probably the heart of this dental office, with her sweet, calm disposition its hard to be afraid of this office. I never ever feel like i don't know what is going on, I for sure feel like i'm coming to visit my three awesome crazy aunts who just happens to be double as a dental office. If you've ever been worried about the dentist or feel like you don't matter or you are just another patient. I would suggest you drop your current  dentist office and run over to this office. They will make sure you are fully aware of whats going on, and if they don't trust me they will make sure that you are aware of what is going on and how to make things better or how to improve upon things. The dentist herself IS AMAZING. The energy these lovely ladies give off the vibes you need for your dental work. <3 thank you Erica for being amazing  and helping me find this awesome place<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_id>

I didn't know what to expect pulling up to the office with my girls, but as soon as we did the office immediately made me feel comfortable. it was nice and clean. Sarah is awesome, very up beat and friendly! Erica was also very friendly. So as I was sitting in the chair, Dr. Sherry Darabi, I got the feeling that she was very considerate about getting a plan in order. she was very nice, informative and professional. I felt that she cared about our well being and how we felt about our smile. I'm recommending her to anybody that needs a dentist.<//Text>

Well, unfortunately I put off Dental visits for too long.  I came here for a broken tooth.  The staff here treats you like family and are very professional.  Even if you don't like going to the dentist,  this is the one you should go to.  Very satisfied!</review>

The dentist knows what he is doing I have no fear when I go in for major work. I had a previous dentist that I would scream for a tooth removal pain I felt all the time even after numbing my gums. Here I don't feel anything. The dentist talks to you while numbing step by step what he is doing. I have been around different dentists places and I can honestly say this is the best place. I had a root canal procedure and it was a good experience.</text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I'm so happy to have found this wonderful office! After having a not so good experience with a previous dentist, I searched for what seemed like forever to find a good match for myself and my family. I hate going to the dentist, so finding one that felt comfortable was on top of my list. Dr. Darabi and her team made my husband and I feel so at ease from beginning to the end of our visit. One of the biggest pros for me is that they also see children. My son accompanied us and would normally be bored to death, but one of the sweet staff members offered to turn on a movie for him while he waited in the lobby. He was actually happy to know that he would be coming here for his routine dental cleaning from now on. The excellent reviews are no lie! Dr. Darabi is awesome.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1582787913822, 'text': 'Thank you Briana'}<//Response>< GmapID>

I absolutely love this place, I was looking for a new dentist for couple months and came across this one, saw the reviews and decided to get it a try. And I must say I love the doctor she is amazing so careful and above it all so honest with her work, she tells you what she thinks is best for you etc. The staff as well is amazing the vibe you get from all them is awesome. I would hands down with no doubt recommend this place to everybody I know!.</text>

Dr Darabi is patient, gentle, and thorough with her work. When her staff found out I hadn't eaten all day and I wouldn't be able to eat for a while after my dental work, she even waited for me to get food real quick so I wouldn't be starving afterwards.

<Review>Dr. Darabi is the sweetest most honest dentist. She is all about preventative care and doesn't want to upsell you on unnecessary treatment which most dentist do. She is recommends, explains and let's you make the decision unlike other experience I had with several other dentist.

I recently got a few filling done at her office and she showed me the work she was doing with pictures which was the 1st time a dentist ever did that for me. Her transparency with me demonstrates that she cares and wants us patients to know and be aware of the work she is doing.

Dr. Darabi and her staff are very gentle with their work and do all they can to help us patients feel at ease and comfortable. GREAT TEAM WORK! Come see these lovely ladies. You wont regret it.</Review><Rate>5</Rate>< gmapID>

Sure, I was just fitted for my retainer today, but I was in and out lickety split! Whenever I get a cleaning it is very thorough and the hygienist is never afraid to tell me when I'm doing something wrong!< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Dr. Darabi is the best!

Glassell Dental is filled with kind, heartwarming, real people.  Guadalupe and Yadira gave excellent service and were very down to earth and made me feel very comfortable.

Dr. Darabi gave the most gentle and thorough dental cleaning and examination I've ever had!  I was pleasantly surprised to see she was making sure to check for every possible issue.  She made sure there was no risky x-rays since we're trying to conceive.  She double checked for any potential oral cancers (never had a dentist check for that before).  And she made sure to start out by letting her know if I was ever feeling any discomfort or sensitivity.  She had a system to have me raise my right hand if I did.

My teeth feel great and I feel great.  I'm recommending this place to all my family + friends!<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Love this place. I've always been a nervous dental patient, but Dr. Kwon and his staff make it an incredibly pleasant experience. They are accommodating, flexible, and the most friendly group of people. Dr. Kwon made my visits quick and painless. I hate the sound of the drilling so they offered me a tablet and headphones and I was able to listen to some music while they worked on my teeth! He provided thorough explanations to answer all of my questions.  If you need a fantastic dentist in Orange County, I highly recommend Glassell Dental. I will be telling all my friends and family to come here.</Text>< user_id>

They deliver the cheapest flowers all over the world. Their mission is to assist you in making connections with loved ones and expressing your feelings for them. Their flower bouquet will undoubtedly be of assistance to you! They reduced the cost of their goods in order to assist you even though you were thousands of miles away.

Emily was an utter pleasure to work with. She knows what she's talking about. She worked within my budget and was extremely accommodating during the process. She also sent flowers to the hotel where we were getting ready in the morning and assisted all of the men with their arrangements. The mothers' flowers were attached with magnets which was super cool and my bouquet was everything that I had hoped it would be.<//review>

In this town, this flower shop has the most beautiful flowers. When I bought my wife a flower, I went there. Fortunately, the florist was a child, and she gave me a flower that my wife would definitely enjoy. She planned it and wrapped it in such a perfect way. Big thanks to the girl from the florist for helping me out. My wife is so fond of flowers.</Text>

I had the wonderful experience of delivering these flowers, and the recipient, was so happy. They were so beautiful, I had to snap a photo! It's rare to find roses that are opened!  The manager was so kind! A++++</review>

<Review>You deserve to be highly recommended to everyone! Last Monday, I went to your flower shop to buy a bulk of flowers. I was so happy because your florist helped me to choose the best flowers for my mother's birthday celebration. I was so happy with the pricing because it was so affordable. Thanks, guys! Strongly recommended!< /Review>< pictures>

I've been coming here for years. And as long as I live in this area this is where I'll go for all my plant and flower needs. The staff is friendly and there selections are also fresh. Be mindful that like any other flower shops, big holidays like mother's day will be busy or sold out of a lot of popular arrangements or roses etc. But calling ahead of time for them to set aside something for you will guarantee your arrangement. They have their own parking lot that's shared with a Starbucks. BUT! they have spots reserved specifically for the flower shop.</text>

This flower shop is amazing. The flowers exceeded my expectations and the service was impeccable. All of their staff was extremely pleasant to work with and I loved their same-day delivery. The florist is very expert, creative, and professional. It was totally smooth and remarkable experience. I highly recommend this flower shop to everyone.</Review>

Amazing customer service and quality! Ordered from Dallas to deliver locally in LA to family and needed to make sure it got delivered when they were home. Called me personally to let me know they hand delivered, and they were blow away. I would highly recommend!<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>American Flowers just created the most beautiful flower arrangement for my Mom for her funeral. She always told me she wanted a lot of stargazer lilies (her favorite) on her casket. Ibrahim called all over town finding stargazer lilies that were in bloom. They created the most amazing display for my Mom.

I've been buying her flowers from American Flowers since I was in high school, over 30 years ago. I'll continue to bring her flowers from them when I go to visit her at the cemetery. They have always created such lovely arrangements that my Mom loved!</Review>< pictures>

<text>I ordered a balloon bouquet delivery and Abraham was wonderful. Efficient and friendly service with a very diligent and personal touch! My friends were thrilled with the quality and presentation!  Delivery was quick, which was unexpected as I placed the order that same day and requested local delivery within 2 hours. Abraham made it happen, with a smile! I will be using American Flowers without hesitation and also recommending them with full confidence.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I LOVE this florist!! Every single arrangement that I have ordered or received as a beautiful surprise from my guy has been simply amazing! Great prices and the arrangements arrive just as shown or better from the website. The owner is so kind and the person that delivers is always kind as well!  Thank you American Flowers for great customer service and supreme satisfaction!!</Text>

My mom and I wanted to stop in to get some arrangements made for a funeral. Their website says they open at 8am. We were standing in the front for 47 minutes. We knocked and yelled hello. We called but there phone isn‚Äôt setup and the voicemail isn‚Äôt activated. For a business that says open at 8am, they weren‚Äôt. They should change their website and set up their phone because it‚Äôs not professional to keep potential customers waiting, especially if you they were going to spend money at your store on your products. It irks me when business are not open on time. It‚Äôs sad too because I hear your arrangements are lovely but unfortunately our business will be taken elsewhere.

An update: it‚Äôs now 9:10am and they are still locked and still not open. My mom wants to go here because supposedly they are open and all other florists are either out of business or not open till 10am. It‚Äôs pissing me off though because your competition isn‚Äôt open for another hour and yet instead of using those two extra hours to service potential clients and earn money, you piss customers off instead by not being open which in turn gets you this awful review. Sorry for the rant, hopefully this will change when and if they decide to open.<//Text>

<Review>Wanted to treat myself to a bouquet and stumbled across American Flowers on Sunday. Huge huge selection. Found a lovely bunch of flowers but was hoping to add a few sprigs of rosemary to it. They happily added the rosemary at no charge and now my whole place smells amazing. Will always come here for my flowers!< /Review>< Pics>

Fantastic!  I needed three large stage arrangements for a culmination ceremony at our middle school.  I placed the order the day before.  What I picked up was amazing!  The arrangements were beautiful, full of color and variety.  Way beyond my expectations.  I will be back and would highly recommend American Flowers to anyone!< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Simply perfect! It may be surprising to you, but nowadays, finding a great local flower shop can be very challenging. My experience with American Flowers was perfect. I found them through a Google map search, but I paid attention to their star rating. As soon as I entered into this place, I received a warm welcome from the owner, who spent a lot of time with me discussing about the arrangement that I needed to order. The arrangement was really beautiful and the designer put a lot effort creating it with great choice of high quality and fresh flowers. I am so happy having found that place and will go back again.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Updated 2-14-19
This place closed on 12-31-19. So sad.

I've been to this little hole in the wall on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. First and foremost, it's a dive bar, nothing fancy.  There's no charge to get in.  It isn't a club so check your expectations, it's a bar. The bar is long and has stools with two tables and a couch to the left of the bar but you have to call and reserve the tables.  Happy hour is until 8 PM. There's a dart machine and automate music player which plays music for a fee, it also closes up when the crowd starts showing up.  Around 9:30 - 10 PM a live DJ comes and plays all kinds of music.  It does get crowded and its mixed with young and old people with primarily young people. Toward the end of the night the line to get a drink increases but this is standard across most bars I've been to.  The bartenders, especially Jess are awesome.  If you treat them respect they'll reciprocate, simple.  This is a nice alternative to a club and I highly recommend checking it out if you want enjoy drinks, good convos and live music.<//text>

<Date>1534738156461< /Date><Rating>4< /Rating><review>I came here on a Saturday night with a few friends around 10:30pm. There is no entry fee. When we entered the bar you can tell it's a dive bar on a typical night but more of a lounge on the weekends.
The bar was starting to fill up around the time we arrived and within an hour had a line to get inside, so early arrival is suggested if you want to get inside. The environment was chill,  so jeans and a cute top with sandals was the perfect outfit.

The drinks are good and are decently priced; I had a double Grey Goose for $14. They had a dance floor where they played top 40s and hip hop. Almost everyone was dancing. It didn't get overly crowded since they only let people in as people left, so you still have space to move around and not feel like you are constantly bumping into others.

It's a fun place to check out with a few friends if you're on the first side of the town. It's nice to get off of Ventura Boulevard or Hollywood.< /review>< pictures>

Such a weird atmosphere. The music is always horrendously loud - seriously, way too loud - and the inside is so open it just doesn't have a welcoming feel to it. Service was HORRIBLE one evening around 6pm...took forever to get ahold of a bartender, and then once I finally ordered a beer he poured it and let it sit on the opposite counter for a whole 6 minutes before giving it to me. It wasn't even busy at the bar.</Text>

I did an oil change today and with their $20 discount they had the best price for my entire neighborhood! They also made sure my tire pressures were correct. Quick and professional service! Thank you! I will be back again next time! üòä< /text>

Called to get a price on getting my motor mounts replaced on my escalade, got a price which was very reasonable and brought in the same day, had truck for a couple of days cause I asked for a couple more things to do which they didn't have a problem with, the staff was courteous and very friendly. Got truck back everything was done perfectly and on time, will definitely bring my vehicle back again. Thanks.<//review>

Only giving 4 stars because it's only a few months have passed after my visit.
Brakes are fine and the service given was good.
I would recommend this business.< /Review>

I feel the workmanship at this Brake Masters is complete.  I thought I needed more work on my car.  They said it was not necessary, the work they did took care of my concerns. I drove 2500 miles and still no issues.</text>

<text>Went here last week to get brake pads changed on both axles on my 07 Honda Civic EX. Manager told me I needed four new rotors which probably wasn't totally inaccurate since my car has 85k miles on it. Decided to just do the front axle. Rotors were $100 each (really high price). Cost me $400+ out the door for one axle. My fiance's BMW 328i cost far less due do the same service at another place with the brand OE parts. I would never go back here for anything but maybe an oil change and even that would be a stretch as the manager is pretty unfriendly and seemingly upset constantly.</text><resp>None</resp>< name>

<Text>Referred there by America's Tires. They performed an alignment with my existing worn out tires. I then purchased new tires from America's Tires. My wife said, 'why didn't I get the alignment with the new tires on?' That bugged me for a whole week until I finally called Brake Masters and they said, 'bring the car in.' I explain to them my idiotic dilemma and they did not hesitate to help me. Superior customer service! Side note: I will bring my other car in to Brake Masters for an Alignment Service soon. Thanks gentlemen.<//Text>< rate>

DO NOT TRUST THEM! They use very cheap parts that break soon after they install them. They installed axles on my car. I had to come back to them a week later because the car was shaking badly.
They replaced with no extra charge, but the car continued to shake. I brought the car back in and they told me that it takes time for the axles to behave correctly. Because the car was still shaking, I brought it back in after a while and they told me the reason for the shaking was because the engine mounts were old and needed to be replaced.

They assured me that the car will stop shaking. They replaced the bottom and top engine mounts, but the car was still shaking. I brought it back in, but they couldn't find anything wrong. I went to Pep Boys. They checked and said that the top mount was not installed correctly.

I brought it back in. I am not sure what they did, but they told that everything is good. The car continued to shake. I brought it in again and this time, they told me that one of my tires is not in perfect shape and that is what causing the shaking.

I went to Big O in Tarzana. They checked my tires and said nothing is wrong with the tires. I came back again, and again they insisted it is the tire.

At this point, I decided I should take the car to another mechanic. I took it and was told that the top engine mount is broken. That mechanic also told me that something wrong with one of the tires.

So, again, I took it to Big O. This time in Canoga Park. The manager there told me again that nothing is wrong with my tires, but he confirmed that the top mount was broken (and this is only 3 and 1/2 months after Break Masters installed it).

To make a long story a bit shorter, eventually, I had to go to the dealer. I had to replace the engine mount and one of the axles, since one of the axles Break Masters installed, was too short, and that was what causing my car to shake.

Trying to get my money back is another issue. They refuse to give me my money back unless I give them the defective parts back. Unfortunately, I do not have the broken engine mount, since the mechanic did not give that to me.

Beside that, I feel they put my life in danger by installing cheap and uneven parts that break immediately after.< /review>

I went in to have front break pads replace on my Lexus suv. Break Masters decides to open the hood of my suv and remove all four of my tires. I received an ESTIMATE OF $398.98 for front break pads and replacement of two rotors. I also received an estimate of $408.98 for rear break pads and two rotors.  I just had my rear break pads and one rotor replace 4 mos prior. My boyfriend texted me that was to much, so I informed break masters that the ammout was to high and I only asked for a replacement for front break pads. The price was then dropped to $368.98 I stated that was still high and that I've paid around $260 before. Then he gives me his personal employee discount and the price was now $308.98. Still high I decided to get another estimate. The place I went to before was over 30 miles away and I didn't want to drive that far. I ended up FINDING ANOTHER PLACE, that replaced my FRONT PADS FOR $160 pads & labor no rotors needed. Im now a customer for life because of the honesty..<//text>

On three separate occasions this placed has been closed with a be right back sign stating 12:15pm and it's 12:40 pm with door still locked. On another visit they didn't even put up a "be right back sign". Something has got to change.< /text>

Leticia was quick to respond and so professional. She fixed our iPhone battery charger in record time for good value. Much better than having to pay for a new phone! T-Mobile recommended this store. Thank you for your great job!<//Review>

Mike Is a great guy. If you need a phone repair I would definitely recommend heading over to RepairAll. The price for the repair may be a little more, but nothing beats having great customer service that you can trust if you end up finding a button or something goes out after the repair. Not that common these days to find that in a business.< /text>

A few hours later my phone completely shut down and started going in and out of re-boot. I tried everything I found online like hard-reset and even updated by connecting to iTunes. No-luck, iTunes was trying to force me to do a factory reset. This wasn‚Äôt an option for me because I would lose all my work on my phone. I started searching Yelp for a phone repair.... it was Saturday night and 9/10 spots were closed the following day (Sunday) but not repair all. I requested a quote through Yelp and got a response within 5 minutes to bring the phone in the following day on Sunday @11am to their Manteca branch. I dropped off my phone wotofo Leticia and she took care of it for me. She opened my phone and repaired the water damage. My phone is good as new and she charged me only $50 for it. Thank you for the wonderful service.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>I went here because of there rating and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. I had just went somewhere else ( manteca computer services) and had some faulty screen replacement that ended up frying my motherboard and top it all off screen didn‚Äôt work properly.... So I explained my concern and frustration and the young lady here assured me she could fix and she had it fixed in 30 min unlike other place that took a week also said I would have a year warranty on the screen, so super happy wish I would have went there to begin with</text>< user_name>

Went in today to repair my granddaughter‚Äôs iPhone.
Was helped by Luis, who provided excellent customer service. He was helpful and very patient. He also helped me restore the phone after he repaired it and was friendly during the process.  I will definitely be back.< /Review>

So my phone got stepped on and my phone stopped working completely, first it was a blur then it would not turn back on. It was my first time taking it in and the customer service Greg provided was absolutely great! I thought it was going to take a while to get my phone fixed but it ONLY took 30 minutes and the price was reasonable! He did forget to give back my screen protector back because he had to leave as soon as my phone was fixed due to a family emergency ‚òπÔ∏è But overall, I would highly recommend this place if anything happens to your electronics.< /review>

<Review>Called 45 minutes before they closed, Luis assured me he could replace the screen on my granddaughter's iPhone 7 if we could get there soon. Now 20 minutes later we were there and it's Luis replaced the screen and the world was perfect once again. We've dealt with a lot of repair stores, this was by far the most efficient and affordable, we will be back!!!< /Review>< Response>

< review>
A couple weeks ago on Friday I brought my laptop with a replacement battery to be picked up the next day.  Prior to closing I received a call informing me that I had the incorrect battery and the technician provided me with specifics from the battery in my laptop, which I was able to look-up on Amazon. A week later the correct replacement came so I returned with my laptop and was able to pick it up Saturday afternoon. I appreciate the quick turnaround, I‚Äôve noticed an improvement over the past few days.</review>

I really was at my wit's end with my daughter and her I phone screen that was damaged. And if it were not for this place and the gentleman who was very nice and professional I don't know what I would have done! If I ever need something like this I will definitely be back and tell others about my great experience at RepairALL<//text>

Absolutely loved the customer service and the speedy repair. Claudia made sure I did not leave without a good protector case and screen protector. whatever questions i did have she was able to answer them. She even went above and beyond to help us in our time of need. I highly recommend this repair shop.<//text>

Bryan was great, service was perfect some of these reviews on here are horrible, if your device is non function when you take it in, liability is on you if something is not working. Bryan quoted me over the phone for a screen and battery replacement on my iPhone, he was able to get me in right away, he kept me updated along the way which I thought was nice, phone was repaired and I had it back in a few hours, he even gave me a discount for replacing both items at the same time. Their policies are written out in the shop, as is their warranty, read it. I‚Äôve already recommended this place to a few people.< /text>

I was so excited to find my screen was not broken, but just the tempered glass screen protector I had bought here a few months ago.  I was so happy, I bought a screen protector for that phone and for another family member.  Claudia was superb in service and professionalism!</review>

< Review>
Last night my iPhone XS Max screen got shattered, I was looking for a repair shop, and found this shop. I walked in and Talked to Moe, although I didn‚Äôt have an appointment, he was able to take me in and was helpful and told me my phone was going to be ready in an hour. I left my phone and returned later. My phone looks and feels brand new! Moe even helped my find a better tempered glass screen protector with better warranty then Zag. Prices were more than fair and I would come back the moment I have an issue with my phone or iPad!< /Review>

<review>Brought my phone in to get the charging port fixed. My screen worked just fine. When I went to pick it up the screen was broke. The guy working said since the phone was dead when I brought it in we couldn‚Äôt do pre tests to make sure the screen wasn‚Äôt broke they wouldn‚Äôt replace it. I know for a fact the LED part of my screen was just fine along with the outer part of my screen. He offered a discount on the screen even though he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt break it.‚Äù I would recommend going somewhere else because who knows how many things they  ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt break‚Äù then offer to fix for a small discount later.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>Phone screen is acting up and having a hard time responding to touch. Sometimes it will be fine but then it won‚Äôt let me press my screen and use my phone. I never had this problem until I got it fixed and it‚Äôs messing with my day-to-day usage. Even just typing this message it is causing me to constantly go back and fix what I have typed because it is not typing some of the letters. I even reset my phone thinking that would help but it didn‚Äôt. I am Very disappointed with the service, not worth the money spent on it.< /text>< Resp>

The staff are very helpful and friendly. One employee, I believe his name is Ke‚ÄôShaun, replaced my phone screen in a matter of minutes and explained the process as he took it apart. They also have a pretty nice selection of cases and accessories. I definitely recommend RepairAll to anyone who needs phone repair!</Text>

<Review>First visit they were courteous,  fast service, affordable prices

Had a second visit to have a tablet fixed. Parts had to be ordered. It took to two phone calls and a visit to find out after 4 weeks that the parts were never ordered. After a total of six weeks to get it back.<//Review>< name>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Went in for warranty claim because the screen on my iPhone was acting up after a few months when they replaced it. I was promised that it was under warranty and will be replacing for free. Came back 45 minutes later to check on the status then Keshawn told me that my screen had a big scratch which was not there before I gave him my iPhone so he said that the warranty is void. (ended up paying $83 for a new replacement screen) on top of that I was never given a receipt because he claimed that he ran out of ink on his printer. Really? What kind of business are you running here?! I will never ever go back to this place ever again because they don‚Äôt treat their returning customer right!<//Review>< pictures>

Knowledgeable, courteous young lady that helped me. She stopped what she was doing and gave me her undivided attention. Answered all questions ( pricing, sizes and etc)
Nice place. Looks like they have every type of case and screen protector that one would need.</Text>

<Review>I thought I needed to replace the charging port on my iphone. Greg  could have done that.  But he was honest and told me it only needed to be cleaned, which he did at no charge.  I wanted to buy something to say thanks and help keep this business growing.  So I bought a charging cable!!! Thanks Greg!!  I'll be back!< /Review>< GmapID>

I called around to get quotes on my phone and found out that RepairAll was the only repair store to offer a free diagnosis in the area. So I took my IPhone 6 to RepairAll  the next day as soon as the store opened. I could tell that Gregory knew what he was doing because he fixed it within 15 minutes! The repair was affordable and the customer service was excellent. I definitely give it 5 stars!< /Review>< UserId.>

Honestly, now I won't go anywhere else. My phone screen completely shattered on the kitchen floor. I called on a whim and I couldn't ask for more! Excellent customer service, affordable prices, super helpful and got my phone fixed in minutes! I definitely recommend!!</Review>

<Text>I had talked to someone two days prior to coming in to get my screen fixed and was offered a good deal, called after a few days talked to someone new and asked about what the other guy had offered and he said he would honor it, I thought that was pretty awesome! Super fast, only took 20 minutes to fix and not super expensive like other places! Very nice as well. Highly recommend my screen looks good as new!!< /Text><time>1524767752269< /time>< rating>

The store is super clean & organized - they're always available & ready to assist. Repair costs very reasonable and are completed in a timely matter.  This is the part that sets RepairALL above it's competition - no matter if they get my business or not, I know Greg & staff will guide me into the correct direction.</Review>

I went in and he took 30 minutes to repair my phone which I thought was a little odd because most places say 2 hours. When I got my phone back my screen was ghosting and he repaired it again that day in 30 minutes again. My phone works perfect now great service and prices< /Review>

2nd time in for service. Yes, I dropped it AGAIN.
I cannot say enough for their business and service,
Honestly!
Last time in I purchased a new screen. I was told a screen protector could save my screen from cracking, so I had them put one on.
When I dropped my phone, I could see the glass was shattered.
I brought it in to have the glass replaced and when the gentleman removed the screen protector, I was shocked. For once, I had been sold something that actually worked. I had a new screen protector placed and my phone is like new again.
I would recommend this company to all. You will not be disappointed.<//text>

Really great customer service! I messaged Repair All Phone Repair and another local phone repair shop through the maps app with my phone info and what I needed fixed. Repair All promptly replied within 30 minutes with a quote and also notified me that the part would have to be ordered. The other place read my message, but never answered. So I went in store to Repair All and paid, about a week later I got a text saying my part was in. I called and asked if they had time to fix it now. Dropped it off and an hour later was ready to go. Employee even left the protective plastic on there, and left it up to me if I wanted to take it off or leave it on, which is a nice gesture in my opinion because I know some people who do like to leave it on. Basically, I would DEFINITELY recommend that you go here for any phone repairs.</Text>

They were friendly and nice. I went in to replace a screen for an iPad Air first generation. Cost me $90 with a lifetime warranty. I happily paid it. Dropped it off and picked it up the next day. I will definitely go to them again.<//review>

<Review>I was referred to this shop by the ATT store almost a year ago. . I am a repeat customer and I will continue to use this repair shop for all my electronics. I needed a screen replaced on my iPhone 6. Repaired while I waited and with the coupon the cost was $30 less than batteries plus. Recently had another phone fixed and was given a generous discount for an inconvenience caused by a new employee. This shop stands behind their customers with courtesy and great service, I would recommend this shop to everyone.<//Review><GmapID>0x8090419fdd420aed:0xdf55209257e51f99</GmapID>< response>

I found RepairAll online with great reviews and I walked in with an iPhone nightmare- multiple broken phones that all decided to have problems at the same time. I picked up my working phones an hour later and they are as good as new! The price was great too. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anybody that needs repairs done. I wish I had found them a long time ago!<//text>

<review>Took iPhone 6s in to get a new battery. Left with phone and realized when I got home that it wasn‚Äôt charging properly. Couldn‚Äôt go back until next day. Store did not have another battery. I was told delivery would be in about 2 and to call back at 2:30. I called at 3 and was told, oh yes it‚Äôs here, I‚Äôll get right to it. 5 minutes later I received a call that this battery was bad also. The manager drove from Manteca store to Modesto store and got another battery. I finally got my iPhone back with a good battery installed at 7:00pm. Manager was very apologetic and made extra effort to get me my phone back. Maybe they need to change their source of batteries.<//review>< Gmap_id>

I shattered my IPhone 7 Plus screen completely. I came in to repairALL mid day on a Friday and he told me it would take 40 minutes to replace the screen. It was done 40 minutes later. Same cost as taking it to the apple store but way faster and more convenient. No hassle.< /text>

I also invested in a fireproof case for better better protection and they gave me a great discount on the case and $10 off for signing up on their rewards program! They were great and I‚Äôd strongly recommend the guys at RepairAll! Thank you!!!</review>< resp>

<text>I shattered my IPhone 7 Plus screen completely. I came in to repairALL mid day on a Friday and he told me it would take 40 minutes to replace the screen. It was done 40 minutes later. Same cost as taking it to the apple store but way faster and more convenient. No hassle.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Review>I broke my phone screen and use my phone for business and needed to get it fixed. I went to RepairAll in Manteca on Hulsey road and they fixed it within minutes! I also invested in a fireproof case for better better protection and they gave me a great discount on the case and $10 off for signing up on their rewards program! They were great and I‚Äôd strongly recommend the guys at RepairAll! Thank you!!!< /Review><time>1518797345535</time>< name>

The guy was super nice and quick, the only reason I‚Äôm giving 4 stars is because the first screen he put on was defective and he had to replace it again. I would just say check your new screen before you leave. But all in all, we had a good experience!</Review>

I broke my iPhone screen and wasn‚Äôt sure if there was more damage because before the screen cracked all the way my phone glitched out terribly, so today after my daughters soccer game I went to this location to get a quote and after speaking to the technician he told me that they could do a free diagnostic which was great because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I need a new phone or just a new screen. The diagnostic was done in less than 10 minutes and it turned out I just needed a new screen (great news) so I was in and out within 30 minutes which is notable because I couldn‚Äôt get an appointment with Apple until a week and a half from today! The technician was super friendly and made the whole experience wonderful from beginning to end..the apple store is good at what they do BUT as far as expedited repairs and customer service they are lacking.  I will be taking our phones here from now on not just based on that but the price as well!  I don‚Äôt always leave reviews but when I do it‚Äôs because the service was above and beyond or extremely lacking in quality and I‚Äôm happy to say that this was a great experience and have already told family and friends about it!
-thank you again!</Text>

<Text>Going to Repairall in Manteca was
a great experience. Greg, the store
Manager, is a very personable and
Knowledgeable representative who
repaired my antiquated 5 iPhone
with 30 minutes, after advised by
my carrier to just get a new phone.

Well great customer service never
never goes out of style and I highly
recommend the repair service of

I stopped into Repair All to see about replacing the battery in an iPhone 5. Ten minutes later the problem was fixed and I was on my way. The service was excellent and much less expensive than replacing the phone.</review>

I waited 2 hours to jus be told my daughters phone had a touch disease, meanwhile at least 5 other people came into the store an the young man working alone was unable to fix any of the phones, I personally feel he doesn't know what he's doin an should receive more training, I'm quite upset I wasted that much time, for him to tell me to contact apple, very disappointing, if the staff isn't trained properly this business we be closed down in no time..<//review>
