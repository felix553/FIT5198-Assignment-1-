The main issue is that unfortunately, our (registered) service dog was discriminated against.  After waiting 30 minutes past our reservation, we were rudely informed that our table had been given away to another party because our dog was not allowed on the patio. This is a trained, well-behaved dog that provides necessary medical assistance to my friend. The dark-haired hostess was entirely unapologetic to the entire situation until I threatened to write a review. I will be filing an ADA complaint.< /review>\n",

Once they opened, the woman was quite friendly to the other 2 parties. One of those parties let her know we were there first but she proceeded to help them first. Then she turned to us and said hi. My fiance said hi and and after that, the woman just stared at us for 10 or 15 seconds like we were nuts; she didn\\'t ask how many people or indoors or outdoors etc. like she did for others. Instead of making us feel welcome, she made us feel like we were a nuisance. Finally, my fiance said we had two people. She abrasively asked what the name for the reservation was (as if we needed one) and silently walked us to our table. I then heard her ask another table (after they were already seated), if they \"happened to have a res, by chance.\" The first impression that someone in the customer service industry gives speaks volumes. I considered having my wedding rehearsal dinner here but am so glad I had the opportunity to experience the poor customer service of the main hostess. I wouldn\\'t want my wedding guests to have the same experience so we will be going elsewhere and I will not be returning.

The intimate patio has individual tables for privacy, but also has two long communal dinning tables. The staff was instantly warm, hospitable, and attentive without hovering. The Andalusian omelette with Spanish chorizo was mildly rich in flavors that went perfect together. A great dish for brunch where quality flavor is desired without sensory overload. The Spanish chorizo was a bit difficult to cut the way it was presented, however, the flavor more than made up for it. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the greens were a wonderful compliment to the dish. I can’t wait to return and experience a dish from their dinner menu.

For cocktails, try a Sage Wisdom (created by GM Marie) - refreshing aperitif and great palate cleanser after the warm, rich spiced harissa potatoes (do not miss these!). Then, try the shishka spiced tenderloin- sharp garlic sauce goes well with what I think is a citrus/zatar rub. Delicious and tender, perfectly med rare. Have a glass of Far Niente pinot for a silky accompaniment to the subtly warm cardamom rice pudding with a hint of crisp tree fruit - grilled to produce a sugary, sandy mouthfeel against the creamy pudding. Cozy, intimate environment and excellent service from beginning to end, especially by Marie and bartender JP.
