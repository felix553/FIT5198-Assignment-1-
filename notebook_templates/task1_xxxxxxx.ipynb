The main issue is that unfortunately, our (registered) service dog was discriminated against.  After waiting 30 minutes past our reservation, we were rudely informed that our table had been given away to another party because our dog was not allowed on the patio. This is a trained, well-behaved dog that provides necessary medical assistance to my friend. The dark-haired hostess was entirely unapologetic to the entire situation until I threatened to write a review. I will be filing an ADA complaint.< /review>\n",

A woman poked her head our and just said, \"Yes?\" We said we had a reservation for 2 people to which she replied \"We don\\'t open until 6.\" We didn\\'t know this and waited 8 minutes until they opened. Once they opened, the woman was quite friendly to the other 2 parties. One of those parties let her know we were there first but she proceeded to help them first. Then she turned to us and said hi. My fiance said hi and and after that, the woman just stared at us for 10 or 15 seconds like we were nuts; she didn\\'t ask how many people or indoors or outdoors etc. like she did for others. Instead of making us feel welcome, she made us feel like we were a nuisance. Finally, my fiance said we had two people. She abrasively asked what the name for the reservation was (as if we needed one) and silently walked us to our table. I then heard her ask another table (after they were already seated), if they \"happened to have a res, by chance.\" The first impression that someone in the customer service industry gives speaks volumes. I considered having my wedding rehearsal dinner here but am so glad I had the opportunity to experience the poor customer service of the main hostess. I wouldn\\'t want my wedding guests to have the same experience so we will be going elsewhere and I will not be returning.

The Andalusian omelette with Spanish chorizo was mildly rich in flavors that went perfect together. A great dish for brunch where quality flavor is desired without sensory overload. The Spanish chorizo was a bit difficult to cut the way it was presented, however, the flavor more than made up for it.

Then, try the shishka spiced tenderloin- sharp garlic sauce goes well with what I think is a citrus/zatar rub. Delicious and tender, perfectly med rare. Have a glass of Far Niente pinot for a silky accompaniment to the subtly warm cardamom rice pudding with a hint of crisp tree fruit - grilled to produce a sugary, sandy mouthfeel against the creamy pudding.

The receptionist stated that they were fully booked and could not see my kitty. I\\'ve never had that happen before - I\\'ve used that vet for 17 years! I did a quick Google search for vets in Poway (not a fan of the other 2 Ramona options) and ended up calling the Poway Animal Hospital (PAH) (powayah.com). That phone call was a complete 180, as the receptionist heard the worry and fear in my voice and said, \"bring her in now, we\\'re busy, but we\\'ve got you\". I drove down there and they promptly took in my girl - I dropped her off due to the estimated wait time they gave me, and the Dr called me before I even got to CVS in town. The Dr clearly explained what he thought was going on AND took the time to answer all my questions (I had many). The next day, I received a call from PAH, following up with my visit - asking how my girl was. The following day, I received a beautiful card in the mail, thanking me for choosing PAH and wishing me & my girl all the best. Hands down the BEST veterinary experience I\\'ve ever had and PAH has made me a lifelong client. I\\'m so glad I chose PAH, as kitty would have died without treatment!
