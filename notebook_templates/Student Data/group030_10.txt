<text>Nice ambiance, actually. Couches, lounge chairs are available for seating. Situated in cozy clusters, like a living or family room. However, the seating is only provided to those who are willing to pay for bottle service $200 and up. Comes with the whole set up.< /text>< Pics>

This place is nice staff was very personable as well. Only small issue that the flooring changes heights in certain places which could be a little tricky but after making your way around the room a couple times you figure out those spots and you able to navigate pretty smoothly through the room...</text>

This spot be tripping. The owner stands outside the club and black ball people even before they get inside the club. There is no dress code list up on the property. I wish we can do better as blacks but I guess not. But from this response that these cats just gave me. They didn't even have a full bar... You asked for a drink and they didn't have it.... I gave this 4 dumbs down...</review>

<text>Ambiance is a great lounge spot. My husband and I don't like packed clubs so it was nice to come, have drink and talk. There is a dance floor if you want to dance too. Beautiful black people everywhere.  Dress code is nice. No tennis shoes, tshirts or hats. I like that fact. I did see a few people out of code but I didn't care, I think a classy establishment needs a dress code that speaks to sophisticated individuals. Our bartender was awesome. The price of the drinks are average for downtown. Good lean though.  We kept ordering. No menu though. Waitresses and security were cool, polite, and friendly.  Only downfall is the cook wasn't there. I was hoping we could eat here too but we can try again another night. Also the bathroom is upstairs next door little odd if your drinking in heels.  I Loved it otherwise. My suggestion would be to have a specific menu for food and a couple crafted cocktails particular to the establishment. We had to go down the road for food and it was gross. So next time I am hoping to be able to eat there. And there is a cover charge after a certain time I don't know if it changes with the day or event. Not over priced though. We will definitely be going back. It was my husband's 30th birthday and he really enjoyed it.  He is hard to impress lol.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>wow...SUPER chill spot. The ONLY negative i see is that the dance floor is small. Not an issue for me cuz i go to lounges to chill; not dance. Not sure what the food menu is but i know they serve brunch. Lounge has PLENTY of what would typically be plush VIP booths; but anybody can enjoy. Has an outdoor patio area with hella space, huge tv, and ample comfortable seating. Another den-like area, with a huge tv and comfy couches, is located right before the patio. Staff is hella cool. Will pop up here EVERYtime i come to Old Sac< /text><Rate>4</Rate></record>

<Review>This place isn't only awful, it's crooked. They sat and served three parties at the bar while I was sitting there waiting for someone to serve me. I finally called someone over to get a glass of wine and some food. Ordered another glass than asked for my bill. I was charged for three glasses of wine when I'd only ordered two. It took twenty minutes to straighten things out when the manager finally told me I was being comped. Checked my statement online the next morning and the full charge was there. This place is a rip-off. Avoid it at all costs.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1549646326748, 'text': 'Hello, we at Ambiance are convinced that you possibly visited a wrong location.. We typically don’t have our Cocktail Waitresses seat customers at the bar due to our bar area being open seating. Our wine selection is limited at the moment because we pride ourselves on supporting local Vineyards through our liquor distributors. If you could let us know what wine you consumed if you were indeed at our establishment at the time it would definitely help us improve as we move forward. Lastly in your review you didn’t confirm what your food order was. That information would also help achieve the level of service that we are striving for. If you were at our location we thank you for your business and invite you to return in the near future.'}</resp>

I was the first “Smiles for Teachers” contest winner. For the past two years now, I have absolutely loved my time with Nalchajian. Every single person I have worked with has been incredibly kind and helpful, always happily willing to serve in any way. They work to make every visit as smooth and easy as possible, making for an incredible experience. On top of it all, the treatment was absolutely top notch! My smile has completely transformed and looks incredible. Thank you so much, Dr. Greg and Dr. Nicole!!< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Dr. Greg explained his recommended treatment plan very well in addition to explaining other options that were available to me so that I could make the best decision. Amanda was really helpful in the financing department. And Beth was always a pleasant voice and face when I came in for my appointments. Everyone in general was so nice and excited for me which put a smile on my face which was great because now I have the best smile to show off!<//Review>< name>

A 10 on a scale of 1 to 5! They are very easy to work with, they communicate well, and don't make you feel dumb when you ask a question. They respect your opinion and your concerns, and go out of the way to ensure you feel like you are in control of your treatments. They did such a terrific job on my teeth that it has taken a little time for me to accept that they are really mine. The results were beyond what I imagined they would be, especially since I refused braces. I recommend them to anyone, and everyone!< /text>

Love this place!!! All of my 3 children have had braces and their teeth look fantastic.  They have a friendly and professional staff and Dr Nicole and Dr Greg are gentle and empathetic to the needs of my children.  Thank you Again! I would highly recommend Nachaljian Orthodontics.<//Review>

We have had a wonderful experience with Nalchajian Orthodontics! So far we have been with them about 4 years since both our children have been in braces.
Dr. Greg and Nicole are fantastic orthodontists! They take the time and care to make all the fine tuning adjustments until they are confident in the work they have done. My daughters smile is beautiful and we know once our sons treatment is complete his will be as well.
They have truly created an office that cares about their patients. Every time we step into the office we are greeted with kind and happy staff. I’m not sure what more you could ask for!</Text>

Great staff was on board especially Sasha Sanchez with her great skills and friendly behavior on visits! I highly recommend anyone to do Invisalign. Less hassle than braces and they’re easy to keep up with. Definitely will be bringing my future kids here one day.<//review>< pics>

I requested a consultation online, and Heidi called me the very next day to book a consultation. Dr. Greg was so thorough in his explanation of what he could do to help me get my gorgeous smile back. It was like he was experiencing all of the problems I was having; I was so impressed with his consultation that I did not shop around for another orthodontic consult! Do not shop around, you'll love these people! Everyone makes you feel so welcomed and so important! You're not just another patient, they really care. Dr. Nicole phoned me last evening to check in to see how I was feeling since my braces were put on 2 days before. How kind of her! I've never had this VIP treatment from any dentist/orthodontist before, and this is not my first time with orthodontic treatment. I can't wait to see my smile once everything is finished.

Dr. Nicole and the assistants are all really nice, friendly, and answer any questions you have about your braces. All the medical jargon can be a bit confusing, so it's reassuring when they explain to you what is actually happening with your mouth. I'd recommend this place to anyone that wants to have a new and improved smile!< /Text>< pictures>

We loved, loved our experience with Nalchajian Orthodontics!! We primarily went to the state-of-the art Clovis office. We have four kids in various phases of treatment including one who just finished. Dr. Greg and Dr Nicole were fantastic, approachable, friendly, and got great results!! The front office was great and always worked to get us the appointments most convenient for our family! We never had a wait which I really appreciate!  The RDA gals in the back were fantastic, always worked seamlessly together, and truly feel like friends. Everyone always went the extra mile, even meeting us in the Clovis office on a day they weren’t scheduled there to deliver a retainer before a holiday. Truly great people and a great atmosphere and they delivered results! We will miss going once our other three finish treatment! Thank you, Nalchajian Orthodontics!<//review>

<Text>Our daughter needed orthodontics and unfortunately had a small palate. We did not want to have to pull any teeth. It was very important that we find someone to help us accomplish this for her. I asked  my circle of friends for recommendations.  We were given a recommendation to Nalchajian Orthodontics.

Dr Gregg provided a thorough and comprehensive evaluation. He gave us options that required no pulling of her teeth. He was kind, and answered all of our questions. All at no charge!!

A move out of state changed all of our plans. Dr.  Gregg found us an orthodontist in our new area that he felt would give us the treatment plan we desired. We loved the orthodontist he set us up with!!  After our daughter was finished with her treatment, my husband and I both ended up in braces too!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>
<Text>Great experience here with both of my teenage sons. We were referred here by our dentist and loved the staff, the doctors and the convenient location. Great results, and the price was comparable to the other places we got quotes at. I would definitely recommend Dr. Greg and Dr. Nicole.</Text><resp>{'time': 1551219874483, 'text': 'Thank you!

All of my family went to Dr. Greg and Dr. Nicole for their orthodontic needs. I wouldn't take my family (or advise my friends!) to go anywhere else. Both Dr's, assistants and office staff care about every patient and their family! They offer the highest quality, most professional care around. After three kids in braces, they feel more like family than they feel like an orthodontist. Don't waste your time or your money going anywhere else!< /review>

Both my Daughter's had their braces done with Nalchalgian's Orthodontics and it was a great experience.  The office is fun, it is always decorated differently for each appointment, with games and prices the kids enjoy. They even have a video game room for them, my girls never used it because we never had to wait long enough. But if you have siblings you have to bring they can be entertained.

All the above is great, but most importantly is that they did a great job. Treatment lasted as long as they said it would.  The strive to do only one set of braces when the kids are about jr high instead of the two phase treatments some orthodontics do. The office is friendly and efficient. Check them out.</Text>

<text>We have had three of our five kids use Dr. Greg and Dr. Nicole for their orthodontic needs (three down, two more to go!).  We absolutely love both of them!  They have been able to address many different needs (overbites, crowding, etc) and produce a beautiful result in each smile.  But what is more important to me is that they saw each child as a person and they were each made to feel important in the process. The staff members are all amazing, patient, and friendly...and HALLELUJAH for them opening up the Clovis office (think coffee for the parents and iPads for the siblings who are waiting). Such a great location for Clovis families!  Just a hop, skip and jump away from Clovis High/Clark making it super convenient.  Dr. Greg and Dr. Nicole and their staff are simply the best in town!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80945c7a82f88703:0x818b73bc655f98f5<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>In 2014, I took my son, a third grader, to get an orthodontic evaluation. During the consultation, Dr. Nicole pointed out my son long chin. Of course as a mom, I seen nothing wrong with my son. She ordered a lateral x-ray of his face. While my son was out of the room, Dr. Nicole preceded to ask me questions about my son; does he wake up often during the night? Does he have allergies? The questions continued, I stopped listening to her questions and focused on the past.

My eyes filled with tears, as she showed my son's lateral x-ray. His adenoids were enlarged pushing his chin downward & causing to block his airway.

Your probably wondering why I was so emotional. When my son was 2yrs old, after a week of being hospitalized, it took five doctors to come to a conclusion & diagnose my son with asthma. After his diagnosis, the hospital became our second home. He had a lot of asthma flare-ups. Almost every pulmonary x-rays were clear. He was given different medications. I am not sure if they even worked. I felt like the worst mom ever. Every time we visited the ER, I always felt attacked. My house looked like a pharmacy. One night, when I called 9-1-1 because my son was pale & having a hard time breathing. My son took a deep breath & yelled out to me "MOM! HELP ME! I NEED HELP! HELP ME MOM!" I cried uncontrollably because I wish I could take it all away. The paramedics got there and immediately gave him an epinephrine shot. He looked zoned out. That night he received two more epinephrine shots. Nothing was working. Again hospitalized. one occasion, I was asked to take a CPR class, just in case.

A few years of this routine, I was so upset. I yelled at the nurse, "this is ridiculous! We are always here! You guys make me feel like a bad mom! I'm doing everything you ask, and I am still here! THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE YOU GUYS ARE NOT DOING! So they ordered him an allergy test. After we got the results, we had to change our living conditions. Our house began to smell like cleaning products because he is allergic to dust & mold. We had to keep our pets outside. He was allergic dog & cat dander. I finally felt like something was getting done.

Boom! Another ER visit. What am I doing wrong? More tests were ordered. Many visits with the pulmonologist. I began to feel hopeless! The hospital bill's began to pile up. I was not working. My husband was in and out of jobs. Our financial situation was spiralling down. Obamacare was not ideal. Not qualify for medical, but had to chose between eating and getting my sons medication. Finally, my husband got a stable job & we were keeping up with mortgage. A few months later a blessing in disguise. My son teeth were so crooked. I felt we were financially stable to get him braces.

After our consultation, I got in my car & cried uncontrollably because Dr. Nicole had no idea what we have been through. This was my blessing. This was the prayer that was finally getting answered! After my son got his adenoids taken out, our lives, his life changed dramatically.

No more hospital visits. His medication was reduced or taken away. He read for a longer period of time. The list goes on, but the best part is that we can finally plan mini vacations without worry.

Getting my son's adenoids taken out, was the best thing that can ever happen to our lives. Thank you Dr. Nicole & the whole staff at Nalchajian Orthodontics!</text>< Pictures>

<text>Very popular place in Chinatown, especially during lunch.  This is my in laws go to place because it's cheap, tasty, and they give huge portions.  Decor/cleanliness is about average for the price.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>This is a budget cafe only take cash. Food is good.  I have been eating there since the cafe was opened many years ago.  Lunch special comes with choice of soup or hot drinks.  Dinner price is under $10.00 per fish.  Watch out the afternoon delight dishes in smaller portion with big discount , afternoon delights run from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm  then again from 8:00pn till 10:00 pm.  Cafe closed at 10:00 pm.  There`s also a 3 course meals with soup and rice included.  This cafe saved me a lot of trouble in cooking.  I give then a 5 stars because of price and a good variety of dishes.  I just picked up my 3 course meals instead of cooking my dinner.  I shared with my son and have plenty of left over for lunch and dinner tomorrow .< /Review>< pictures>

<resp>None< /resp><review>A  "hole-in-the-wall" Hong Kong style cafe that can steal my heart any day. The place is frequented with the local elderly Chinese patrons so that means 2 things:

1) the food is a great taste Hong-Kong style classic meals (beef chow fun, baked pork chop rice, you know the deal)
2) the prices are cheap ($6-$10 are you kidding me?)

Yes, the place is cash only so do come prepared. As mentioned, this cafe is shabbier in interior decor. Manage your expectations with that and the service, which you shouldn't have too high of a standard for, especially with some language barrier.

They have special lunch specials with different dishes on each day of the week. ($6.15 includes a HK tea, which can be upgraded to a milk tea or any other of their cold drinks for .50 cents more)

I had the baked porkchop for $6.05 during their lunch hours (11am-3pm). The porkchop was juicy and tender, the sauce flavorful, and a hefty portion. I left quite happy. Parking can be difficult around here but usually there should be metered spots a block or two nearby.

I'll be back.</review>< Pics>

<Text>The food is good but the service is not. The food is say 4-5 Star the service 2-3 star so say 3-1/2 stars about right. It's inexpensive Hong Kong style food. In middle of Oakland Chinatown.< /Text>< pics>

A la carte dishes at dinner are a bit underwhelming.  The samba Kang Kong was under seasoned for my taste (could use more samba, heat, garlic, and salt).  But their afternoon snacks are pretty good.  Definitely a step up from the previous operation (e.g., ABC)</text>

< review>
I have eaten my lunch and dinner at this restaurant since the new owner took over.  Some waitresses are not  very friendly.  One  or two waitresses never serviced to me. I have to wait other waitresses to take my order. Sometimes, I have to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes to find a waitress during the busy time. The food is not very good, but there is a lot of food on the plate. The price is cheaper than other restaurants.  I heard some people who I know. They told me that some waitresses were not nice to them. They treat some customers very good, no addition charge for drink or soup. They always charged me when I requested a drink or soup. The soup is not fresh at the lunch. They give the customers that the soup was yesterday.

That restaurant is always dirty under the tables when I eat there.  The restroom is not clean and smell. Some waitresses are not very friendly. Now, I feel that I will not go back there.

I give this place in 2 stars.< /review>

Daily happy hour 1000-1100, 1500-1800; weekday lunch specials 1000-1500 $5.55.  During the happy hour window time frame, you may order items like wonton $3.75.  I like there lunch specials on Wednesdays (sauteed rock cod) & Thursdays (double mushroom chicken).  They offer lobster $13.99, with noodles add a dollar.  I usually order to go.  Service isn't very good here, cash only.  Food is pretty tasty for a very reasonable price here.  Lunch time may experience even slower service.</text>

<text>Really tasty food at good prices, relatively speaking.  Here you may order a lobster for USD 15, with noodles add a dollar.  synch with their happy hour offered at: 10AM-11AM, 3PM-6PM, 8PM-10PM to order off their happy hour items, like Wonton mein USD 3.75.  Their wonton has a deep, rich complex taste at such a bargain price.  Certain dishes they excel at, others are not good, usually the deep fried stuff that Occidentals who don't know would usually order.  Weekday lunch specials 10AM-3PM ate a good buy, again avoid the deep fried offerings.  If you check their restrooms, you wouldn't want to dine here, but such as it is, their food here is usually quite good and tasty.  Cash only.</text><user>110850296356097865285</user></record>

<Text>Have been meaning to try out this  place for quite a while. It was around 1.30 pm when we arrived, after luckily found parking just outside. We wrote our name on a board for a party of 4 and then a friendly waiter came out to greet us and told us it would be a 15 mins wait. When we sat down another waiter came to greet us with his French accent and took our order of two crepes $12 each and two mussels $16 each.  Fries $6 and ice cream $3 for one scoop. They were delicious. French bread and water was provided.  The atmosphere was kinda noisy but the service was very friendly.  Will definitely go back to try other items or maybe try Chez Papa next time!  Bon Apetite.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Date>1482769648242<//Date><user_name>Castle Guy<//user_name><rate>5</rate><gmapID>0x808f80b6078e80eb:0x326c8e80e3b67545</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>For beer, the selection is good, but most is not cold.  Check the date as I found several past the drink by date.  Beer prices are OK but you can find better deals.  A good place to find particular beers that are less common and not local.</review>< username>

<review>awesome gym! everything seems to be brand new and always clean. they have tv's on each cardio machine. top that 24hr! doesn't get too crowded. pool facilities are real nice, but wish it was a little bigger and kinda wish membership wasn't so expensive, but i guess you pa what u get for and this place is top notion.</review></record></dataset><record>

After years of not going to a regular gym, Bakar became my choice for its rooftop pool as well as being close by to home. Spacious facilities, ample parking, and mostly friendly staff are a plus. The only downside is that it's pricey, though I'm paying a premium for the pool and newish facilities, and I'd prefer that over some cheap but overcrowded  facility elsewhere.< /Review>

Wonderful environment for kids to learn to swim. The family pool is great for a pre-class warm up and to get my boy liking the water.

The girl is very good with progressive instructions. She always seems to have the right tools for each time my boy got scared.< /Review>

Also a great kiddie pool(splash pad) Complete with fountains and such.Parking is VERY limited so get there early or find street parking(metered) nearby. I recommend this pool 👌👍<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMghGW_wPIEiEuU7KQJMBHY9ZkKflaQmPuRzc7s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><gmap_id>0x80c2c66220952891:0x4f8ff44f0fe21bd6< /gmap_id><rating>4</rating>< Date>

Pool great for kids. They have nice 🏊 classes. Parking is usually a problem and showers need reconstruction. Quite often is crowded. But honestly with all bad thinkings I wrote we like it and will be visiting this Center.</review>

<Text>Great service and great food. Cookies are amazing. Steak sandwiches, chicken quesadilla, and salad are all great. Space smells well and is clean. Our 11 y.o. said “Oreo” ice cream is the “best she ever had.”<//Text>< Rating>

I tried the galletas de maiz which I purchased  at Lola’s Mkt. The first time I tried them they were good. A good gluten-free cookie, which are hard to find. I bought a package recently and they were absolutely horrible. It seems the salt was mistaken for sugar. Apparently there is no QA, these cookies  should have never been sold to the public.<//text>

First time in and immediately greeted by the owner. My wife and I had no idea what kind of bakery this was. Turns out it’s a Mexican bakery with a gourmet twist. They serve delicious baked goods, coffees from around the world, tortas (sandwiches), and salads. If you visit here, be sure to pick up their cookies. The smell of their cookies brought an instant homemade feel and flash backs to when grandma was baking at home. Come on in and taste it for yourself!<//Text>

Delicious sandwiches, alfajores and ice cream. The asada torta is amazing and the dark chocolate-dipped alfajores are incredible. Every now and then they come out with new products that are worth trying, like the macaroons or the strawberry cake. Service is always welcoming as well. I would highly recommend a visit, this shop does not disappoint.< /Review>

EXCELLENT PASTRIES!!!!! Theres not very many options in Pastries or at least at the time I was there which was around closing time. So they possibly have much more during the morning time.
But the Pastries are Very Rich & Tasty! Wasn't too sweet but Great balance!<//Text>

<Time>1563844700206<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) A quiet clean place, there they make the jalisco crunchy birote (The birote is a variety of bread of Mexican origin that is baked until golden brown. It is of consistency similar to the bolillo and its shape is very similar to that of the baguette, but its flavor and consistency are different.It is produced particularly in the state of Jalisco, in the city of Guadalajara) they prepare delicious drowned cakes that remind you and will transport you to the beautiful state, apart from a rich snow-type carafe mmmm

Un lugar tranquilo limpio, ahí fabrican el birote crujiente tipo jalisco (El birote es una variedad de pan de origen mexicano que se hornea hasta quedar dorado. Es de consistencia semejante al bolillo y su forma es muy parecida a la del baguette, pero su sabor y consistencia son distintos. Se produce particularmente en el estado de Jalisco, en la ciudad de Guadalajara) preparan deliciosas tortas ahogadas que recuerdan y te transportara a el lindo estado, aparte unas ricas nieves tipo garrafa mmmm< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHZnHZgfZSEJBJzlGhK1b1u8z8MvBJOjjgr3Rp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObDhnzOtrDd_j5PdFm8JV9Oah0QQ57E4AvNWX_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

For many years now, I have been a committed and loyal Verizon customer. I have frequented a number of stores,  but my allegiance is certainly with the Riverside Plaza location. I am always immediately and warmly greeted and I noticed that the employees seem to work together very harmoniously. They also seem to have a mutual respect for one another and this is impressive to me.

I would like to take this time to SINGLE-OUT a particular employee, however. Heaven A. is exceptional.  He is friendly, courteous,  and respectful. His interpersonal skills are outstanding. He is attentive,  patient, and detailed. His comprehensive  product knowledge and skill is noteworthy, as he activated my new phone and transferred my data in record time. I was extremely particular in what I asked him do and I was completely satisfied with the end product. Heaven made my experience nothing short of EXTRAORDINARY and I thank you for hiring such a dynamic and enthusiastic employee.

Kudos to Verizon!!

Sincerely,
Joyce Reid<//Review>

<review>David, one of the service reps is horrible.  He tried to separate me from my 11 year old daughter and tried to charge me $50 for helping me activate my phone.  The Canyon Springs store was able to help me in 2 minutes without charging me a dime.  When I explained to David that my 11 year old could not go in without me or be left outside the store alone, he called me a Karen and told me to have a nice day.  A formal complaint has been filed with Verizon.  Apparently this location is not recommended even by Verizon and is not a corporate store.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Terrible customer service and not willing to help my elderly grandparents who needed some assistance with setting their phone up that was giving them issues with the 5G setting and did not bother to want to talk to them not once but twice in person and told them to call customer service and didn't seem like they wanted to help them.Verzion is commission base and doesn't care to help anyone only worried about sales not not quality and care of their customer's.This location has Rude and unhelpful staff and terrible management.Do not recommend shopping at this location or in general to use verzion services not worth it.</text>

<text>David was extremely helpful and informative on all my questions. Helping me find everything I needed + more with deals and discounts. Kevin is the reason I visited this store today. After calling multiple stores about one phone. All other stores were short with answers and did not offer help. Kevin set me up to go in and take care of everything I needed. In the end I was helped by David. I was never satisfied with any Verizon store and their customer service before this. They take every precaution with keeping all employees and customers safe during this covid crisis. I was not uncomfortable or uneasy at any point during my visit. Best Customer Service I have experienced at any mobile store. Thanks again Kevin and David. Hope this review helps.</text><username>Rafael Morales</username></record>

<text>Heaven, helped me today in the Verizon store came in worried,  stressed and sad . To my surprised Heaven was truly send to assist from Heaven.  Honestly he is the first wireless consultant who is awesome a super star trained excellent. Every Verizon store etc offices new hires should be train and coached by Heaven.
Thank you Verizon for hiring him.

I was desperate to replace damaged phone and forgot my Verizon code.  Heaven made the experience a positive one, thinking ‘outside the box’ to solve the problem I was having.  He provided helpful suggestions, was efficient and thorough.  I later left the store with a new phone and Apple Watch, happy with my new purchases.</review>

I will start by saying Brandon, the assistant manager is the one that deserves 5/5 stars. He helped figure out the best deals for me and my sister, helped us transfer lines, and worked with our time frame so we didnt miss our movie. The only downside was how busy they were, we had to wait an hr for them to finish helping other customers. With the help we received, and the recommendations Brandon provided, it was well worth the wait! Thanks Brandon!!</review>

I was told I could set an appt.( on 6/19) and talk with the same guy I was on the phone with (Richard) on 6/21 as my daughter was driving for 45 minutes to their store, come to find out, he was 'loaned out' from another store and not even there. Nothing could be salvaged from their side so we went to Sprint and got good service and prices, thank you Sprint. May I never set foot in a Verizon shop again.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

It was one day in the afternoon that I decided to go to Verizon, and when I arrived there was an agent who was there but did not attend to me, because he thought maybe I don't speak English.

Let me tell you that there was another agent named (Austin Shelton) and he attended me and treated me well as I was my friend for a long time and he understood my English.

I bought a new iPhone and he explained very well step by step and he asked me if I had questions for him to explain it to me again.
and he also offered me another product that we all need the product is the Wireless + multi-USB + Portable Battery

guess what? I bought it :)

I am very satisfied with the great service that Austin Shelton gave me,

Thanks Austin Shelton! God Bless you Bro!< /text>

I went in to buy a phone charger. He then, right away pulled out the most expensive charging cord. I informed him I only paid $20 for my last one. He in turn tells me that's all he had. (He grabbed the first one he saw and didn't bother looking) Needless to say, I walked out paying over $30 for a charging cord🤨<//Text>

I went into the store just curious what the current price of an IPhone 8+ was, Cristal wasn’t at all pushy, but very informative.  She informed me about a promotion for an iPhone 11, which would’ve been the same cost of the iPhone 8+, so I jumped at it.  I’ve been to other Verizon locations where they did not provide such offers, Cristal was patient, professional all while informing me of all my phone options & ridding me of my outdated iPhone 6.  No upsells, just exactly what I desired even though I had no intentions of buying a new phone today.  Thank you Cristal for all your help, I know to come back your way for my future upgrades.< /Text>

Working with Marilyn and Brandon was a great experience. I had trade in’s, account credits, a large amount of data to restore to my new phone, etc. your basic nightmare customer, but they handled my  transactions with a great attitude!  They were both wonderful and I would recommend anyone that needs help to go see them at the Riverside Plaza Verizon store!< /Text>

Last night I discovered my cell was dead and the cord had developed a short and it wasn't charging. I got to the store just before closing and the manager said they don't make that cord anymore, but he found one in the back that would work and he didn't charge me for it. Now that's service!< /Review>< pics>

I visited this store yesterday to resolve an issue.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately, they could not resolve my issue and I need to visit a different store to do so.  Not their fault.  If I ever have another issue I'll come back here again simply because of the friendly staff.<//Review>

< Review>
Terrible customer service. Needed to pay bill and took over 30 minutes. Girl agent nice but guy was very unprofessional. After being there over 30 minutes just to pay a bill, which cost 3 extra dollars because I was paying cash, instead of apologizing for such a delay, he told me if I wasn’t happy I could leave...who does that? Never going back.< /Review>

We went into the Verizon wireless in riverside at the plaza, it was a last minute stop 20 minutes before closing and the young gentleman Simran Gonzalez was by far the best customer service representative we have been helped by from many different places. My family as well as myself were very grateful  for his professionalism and his patience, thanks to Mr. Gonzalez my son is now enjoying his iPhone 8. Amazing experience 100% customer satisfaction.😁<//Text>

Had to get my phone's Sim card fixed, and, as it turned out, replaced. Carlos was outstanding-worked on my problem for well over an hour, including multiple phone calls to other locations. When I walked out, I had a new, cheaper-and better-plan. And phone worked flawlessly. It really was excellent customer service!!!< /text>

<Review>I stopped here after getting a new phone from another Verizon and they didn't back up my information from my old phone to my new phone. I went home to try to transfer it myself and it just wasn't happening. I rushed over before they closed and before my dad's birthday dinner to try and get it transferred. Simran was so nice and helpful! I can't thank him enough for doing that for me. And telling me that the other Verizon was in the wrong and should have transfered everything or else I'd have to pay another 50 dollars to transfer.<//Review>< time>

I would put NO STARS if it was possible!!! I've been trying to resolve a problem since May 10th and we are now in JULY going on THREE months. I walked into the store to buy a new phone and was told that Verizon no longer does the 2 year plan and that I would automatically be switched over to a new plan that allows me to upgrade my phone every year. I though "Oh wow, that's nice".. But the sales man forgot to mention that I was paying an extra $80 for this ADD ON plan. The next day I was trying to figure out why my bill was so expensive and I realized I was charged for an extra plan. Naturally I called, said there was a mistake, and asked for a refund. Since than I have talked with a total of 4 different people whom have ASSURED me that they've talked to corporate and my check is in the mail. Have I seen a check? NO. Now every time I call asking the status of my refund they extend the date that I'm going to get my money back and have a huge attitude like it's MY FAULT THEIR COMPANY HASN'T REFUNDED ME!! It's extremely frustrating and I DON'T recommend this location to anyone.<//text>

Unfortunately, the bill amount each month keeps changing and it never is the promised and informed amount that I learned from the store or the customer service. Very disappointing line and device purchase with Verizon.<//Text>

<Review>I went to get a plan for my new phone. They wanted my license and Social Security Card! Who carries a SS Card? (You're not supposed to carry it with you BTW). Of course I didn't have mine, and I haven't seen it in 30 years, so the idiot sent me to the SS Admin on the other side of town, where I waited for 45 minutes, only to get a receipt saying I would get a card in 2 weeks. I went back to the store and showed them the receipt, and told them I had birth certificate and passport,  but that still wasn't good enough. At that point I had enough. I went to ATandT who didn't even ask for my license, and I got hooked up for $15 less a month. This kind of bureaucracy drives people insane.< /Review>< rate>

Scam.  Avoid this place at all costs.  They will offer you a free upgrade which will be attached with additional charges.  They will do anything to get you to purchase additional items solely for the commission.  Try to go to a corporate store if possible.<//Review>

The staff in this Verizon store are very informative and nice. I was able to upgrade my phone with ease, and they helped transfer my information over to my new phone. Very pleased with my iPhone 6S.</Review>

<text>Received a new phone from Verizon and had some questions about transferring some information. Was told they could set up my phone for $49.00 my phone was already set up and I only needed some direction on how to transfer my messages was told $49.00. This was absurd, I did not want them to connect anything I did not want them to do much more than answer a question, they refused. It is an insult to have such a lack of customer service. I know they are not a Verizon store and only brand themselves as such  my advice go ANYWHERE else but there if you need help. It is beyond poor.</text>< user_id>

<review>Employees and the “manager” are literally ass holes. They failed to explain to me about how they share data and charged me extra for stuff I didn’t agree on. Came back to change plans and explained to them why and with a puzzled face they said “uhh yeah that’s how Verizon works, you didn’t know?” Even though I had already told them I would be new to Verizon! So definitely had to say bye to them after that. And on the day I purchased my phones and plans there was already another couple upset and getting zero help from anyone, i should have taken that as a sign!< /review><Response>None</Response>< UserId.>

<resp>None</resp><Text>Came in here last week with my girlfriend and son to take a look at our account, the store manager was very helpful and recommended a plan to suit our needs. We were paying over $60 in overages for the last few months, he switched the plan to a newer one and gave us a free tablet for our son, still saving us $30 monthly with twice the data. We've been customers for many years, and were considering leaving for TMobile, but after this great experience we are giving verizon another run. Highly recommend that store to anybody looking for great customer service.< /Text><user>106422402826070536392<//user><date>1458063491787<//date></record>

You then must fight until you give up to get your money back. I think the newspaper or the news needs a call. Are all Verizon stores doing this too? Hope not.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I finally decided to stop by a Verizon store since it was next door to the Starbucks and the door was locked. Sign says Mon-Sat 10am-8pm. Its monday @11:10am... guess I'll go to an actual Verizon store, instead of a "authorized retailer"< /review>

In a pinch (45 min before they were closing) I called to see if there was ANY chance they could squeeze my car in that was being sold. Thankfully they could 👍🏼 and my experience was awesome! Would definitely recommend and will go back when my next Smog certification is needed.< /text>

Great customer service! Called when they opened and got an appointment at 10am that day. Very friendly, quick, and efficient! They were also offering a special which was great. Cheaper than all the other places I looked at online in Roseville. Would definitely recommend!<//review>

You know it's a great place when the owner greets you himself and updates you every step of the way. They don't make businesses like this anymore.

The first time I came here some years ago was by chance with a coupon I found.  I've been returning ever since and I don't even care about coupons anymore.  I just simply trust this shop.  They're honest, efficient and customer focused.  I highly recommend this place .</text>

Not only did we get treated with excellent care by their tech Sunny but he was willing to stay after hours to make sure that we were taken care of and ready to go. I have never been so impressed with a shop that actually cares about the customer. I would give this a better rating than 5 stars but that was the maximum rating possible. I am sold on this place and will never go anywhere else and I would highly recommend this shop to anyone else looking to get their vehicles smogged.</Text>< Pics>

Nice people and quick service, I have been bringing our cars to Roseville Smog Center for sevral years, they are friendly quick and easy to work with. Price is always better than any other Smog Center. There are no tricks and price does not change.
Even, when I forget to bring the coupon they give us the diacount.< /Text>

I showed up this morning at 9am and was out in about 25 minutes. $40 for the smog and $8 for the dmv registration certificate. Both employees were friendly and helpful.<//Text>

</dataset><record>
<text>One star for existing, I suppose. They sceduled my appointment at 9 and never opened that morning. There was no answer by phone as well, no response to messages. I gave up on them after 40 min and continued down to Vernon Street to Roseville Auto Smog, great service.< /text><Name>one lilbirdee<//Name>< gmapID>

Flat out lied. Said my timing was off 4 degrees(up to three allowed). Shop tested and was off by 1 degree. Said my Catelytic converter wasn't legal...been smogging it three years, with it. Everyone else retests, free, they do 1/2  price...fail to retest and collect. Avoid at all costs.<//Text>

Horrible smog place, the Mexican who works here is a jerk. After my car failed twice a month ago i had the work done to fix it and this guy said he wouldn't smog it because it failed and he didn't want it on his record.</review>

<pics>None</pics><Review>I have always wanted a tattoo but have always been nervous about it hurting. Byron was extremely nice and professional and really help to put my mind at ease. Everyone there we’re really supportive and complimentary to my simple design (line art of ocean waves on the inside of my wrist). I walked out very happy with the detail and color (True Blue). I definitely recommend getting work done here and will return to Byron for the next two I have always wanted.< /Review>< userid>

The people here are amazing artists who are friendly, knowledgeable and professional, the environment is clean, comfortable and welcoming. Keith is the only artist I go to for my tattoos and piercings and he's the best I've seen for cover ups. 1st pic is the mess I had, 2nd pic is after Keith worked his magic and the 3rd pic is 1 year later. I'll never go anywhere else and I highly recommend this shop!</text>

So.....made appointment fot piercing last week.  For 3pm on Monday.  Drive 1.5 hours from mountains to appointment.  We get to the shop, where I ask aboutbthe appointmen and am told that the piercer doesn't come in untill Wednesday. Would have been nice to know, so we didnt drive 90 minutes for nothing.</Review>

The entire staff is wonderful, great attitudes, very friendly and helpful. I've gotten many tattoos from Christian and I love them all! They healed great and look amazing! My boyfriend has also gotten work from Joe and it looks wonderful! Nicole did my industrial and it's healing nicely so far and I love it! 10/10 would recommend for any tattoo or piercing needs.</text>

Guy I got was very awkward didn’t make me feel comfortable at all over charged me and my friend for our tattoos and I think my little sister could’ve done a better tattoo keep in mind these were about as simple as a tattoo can get I called before hand asked if it was okay he said yeah he should’ve been giving his best effort he was done super fast probably due to his little to no effort on my tattoo this will be on me for life I will not be back... the artist charged me 60$ each for two tattoos the size of a quarter they are a sun and moon little to no detail very basic< /review>

This is my favourite shop in Chico!! I’ve been to a few other places and none are as friendly as Exclusive. Bryan is amazing and he’s done 2 pieces for me for great prices! I’ve walked in for all of my tattoos here and the wait has never been long!!! I recommend this shop especially if this is your first tattoo to go here, no stressful vibes at all! :)</Review>

Absolutely amazing. My friends and I decided to get our tattoos yesterday and they were super accommodating. Bryan did my numbers and my one friends quote and he made us newbies feel totally at ease. Keith did my other friends tattoo and did an amazing job answering all of our initial questions.

The shop has amazing and funny artists and employees. It's clean and welcoming. Don't let its location deter you. You can't beat their shop minimum either.

My friends and I will all be coming back for our future tattoos.

Pictured is one photo of mine by Bryan and my friends by Keith.</Text>

<Review>Exclusive Tattoo is the best shop I’ve ever been to! Very professional and friendly! They always have a smile on their faces! Every artist has a great personality and sociable! Nate Kaos is my personal tattoo artist. He has an amazing sense of vision, a great attention to detail, very light handed and quick! This is the only shop I’ll go to!

I recommend this place, him specifically to everyone I know because I am a huge baby and I can barely even feel that he’s tattooing me when he does it. Highly recommend checking this place out!<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Easily the best piercing experience I’ve ever had. Everything was very clean and the staff was so friendly. The piercing wasn’t very expensive and the piercing jewelry and an upgrade piece came included in the initial price. 10/10 amazing staff and experience. I highly recommend Exclusive</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I've been getting all my tattoos done by Brian Myrick here for a couple months now and everything he's inked on me has looked absolutely amazing. The shop itself is also a very welcoming relaxed place so you never feel awkward or out of place just walking in. Highly recommend this place to everyone! By far my favorite shop!</Review>

Mr. Sanchez has done artwork on my arms. I came in one day with an Autism tattoo idea and he took it a ran with it. It was more than I could have ever imagined. He also did a beautiful black and grey skeleton key on my other arm, the detail is just amazing.

The shop is always spotless and it is obvious that everyone that works there, wants to be there.

They are artists there, not just some guys that tattoo. Seriously, if you want some artwork, make an appointment and get a consultation. You won't be disappointed.<//Text>

One of my friends suggested this shop to me. I walked in just to check out the books and walked out with a killer tattoo done by Buffalo. He’s definitely my Chico artist. Not only does he do dope work he’s super clean very welcoming and has puns for daaaayyyss! Make sure you ask to see a picture of his cat, he’s beautiful! I haven’t gotten any work done by the other artists but they seem like chill dudes.< /Text>

I got my tattoo and my sister's tattoo done here for her birthday by Buffalo Brian after a different artist at a different shop failed to show up for the appointment. He got us in right away and banged out two amazing tattoo's for a very reasonable price. I will be returning for future pieces that I want.</Text>

Mr. Sanchez is the man. When I look for a tattoo artist, I am looking for quality work from the artist, but I am also looking for a humble personal experience,  because no one wants to be in an uncomfortable environment while getting something done that should be a fun experience.  Mr. Sanchez is a humble, professional artist and he made my experience a very positive one! His use if color amazes me, he is brilliant and beyond his time. A true gem in chico, ca.</text>

<Text>Since the moment I made my appointment, the customer service was great! I reached them through Insta, and they were very attentive. My tattoo artist Buffalo Bryan was awesome. He made sure I liked the flash he made for the tattoo and the size. He also made sure I had it on the exact spot I wanted on. He even told me we could move it as many times as I wanted until I felt the spot was right! My tattoo came out very pretty and the pricing was good! I also thought it was cool that you can pay through Venmo. Overall they're great 😄<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808327b71461d6bb:0x7e1165558a98f648<//GmapID></record>

Went in with a bunch of coworkers who all 6 of us got piercings! I was the most nervous one, but the vibes here made the visit bearable. Such nice people, and if the prices weren’t already amazing (our group even shopped around for best prices) They gave us a discount for the group with free jewelry change. I highly recommend this place :)< /text>

<review>I had Jose fix a rather large unfinished tattoo. I had been following his work and he is amazing. I let him Free hand fixup my leg piece. He was very attentive to every line and shape and shading. I was amazed to see what a transformation he had done. Professional and clean. I am very happy with the work done and a very reasonable price. I have many more I want to get done and Jose will be my tattoo guy!< /review></record>

All the guys in the shop are fun to work with. The shop is clean and they CARE about their clients and their work.

I heard septum’s are a pretty painful piercing but he was really quick about it I barely even noticed it was over Lol. Came in a second time to get my other piercings changed, they helped me out finding the right gauge, size, and colors I was looking for, and even offered me candy lol .. He tightened the balls on my piercings too which was awesome. This is definitely my new go-to place for piercings.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>I don't think I can put into words how much I appreciate the hard work that went into my sleeve by Jose GQink, I needed a cover up and I needed/wanted it now for my upcoming wedding 👰🏻 Jose took on the task and blew me away. Not only did he exceed what I was looking for but he makes sure your comfortable and puts your best interest at heart. He will be my only "tattoo guy"
As for the shop and the other guys AMAZING! As I sat hours on end for a couple weekends in a row I got to see the guys come together with ideas for their new shop, the way they worked together made me know I made the best decision to commute down to Chico. The artist all love the ART, the money is cool but they honestly take pride in the work. They all want to be the best and when it comes to a PERMANENT body modification I feel like that's important.
The shop is clean, they all have the latest and greatest tattoo equipment, the piercer has high quality jewelry, and you get a free comedy show! I will only recommend this tattoo shop to my friends and loved ones.
Seriously can not say enough good things.< /review><GmapID>0x808327b71461d6bb:0x7e1165558a98f648</GmapID>< Time>

Plan and simple, badass tattoos.  Clean environment, professional artists in the shop and expos, get inked at your own pace, real friendly.  Really good part of town to get inked.  Enjoy your new best tattoo!< /Review>

<Text>Me and my Roomate went in to get her nipples pierced. From the moment we went in the piercer (Crystal) I believe and so sorry if I’m spelling your name wrong, did an amazing job in no only making us  feel welcomed but also on the piercing itself! She definitely made me want to go back for a jewelry change on my nose piercing that I had gotten change before at Red Room where at red room when I went to go change it about a year ago or two the piercer yanked the jeweler out of my nose and put in a new stud in for me it was so PAINFUL. At exclusive tattoo crystal had a guy come in to look at the stud in my nose where he had to take it out and IT WAS NOT PAINFUL AT  ALL ! I was so happy and walked out with a smile . Thank you exclusive tattoos and I highly recommend anyone to go in for their next or first peircing here !< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I have a very low pain tolerance and Jose distracts me so I don't feel the pain as much.

< Review>
Mr. Sanchez is a GREAT artist! I went to Redroom for pricing on a tattoo and i saw their work and they suck ass and very unproffesional! Here at Exclusive Joe Sanchez does AMAZING artwork at an AFFORDABLE PRICE! They have a clean shop and they are really funny and welcoming. Will recommend to everyone and will only come here. Screw other shops in Chico Exclusive is the place to go! 😎</Review>

Came here on a Sunday, about 4p, and was asked by a younger man what we were here for (cartilage piercing). He said a different man would help us, but that employee was busy with a different person. He and the other man did not give us an estimated wait time, and no other staff checked in with us for half an hour unless we asked. There were three other staff members that weren’t doing anything, so we waited another five mins and left.

We did not receive attentive customer service and felt out of place at Exclusive Tattoo from the lack of customer service provided to us.<//Text>

By far the best tattoo shop ive been too!! Very friendly and professional. Mr. sanchez did my tattoo and his line of work is soo amazing. Plus pricing is very afforable unlike the other spots in chico that be rippin ppl off. Over all its a great shop with great vibes and Mr sanchez is beyond talented with his artwork  cant wait to get some more ink done ❤️< /Text>

I go with my wife to this nice place often! This is the best place to have a bite.  I go to this spot at least once a month. The meals are great, the staff members are welcoming and the prices are good. I like meeting in this spot over a good supper.<//Text>

Pretty good, fast and reasonably priced Korean food. Eat in or take to go. I find that only the kimchi can be inconsistent, sometimes too raw, others too fermented.<//text>

The best part was being greeted and spoken to in native language.  The to go order was prepared in two minutes upon arriving, after just ordering it ten minutes ago.  NO main dishes are served in plastic containers, just condiments.  That was very nice to see. They even have buzzer pods to notify you of your order.  Very welcoming. Kimchi was rotten.< /text>

<name>Francisco Alvior< /name><text>Great Korean comfort food at a reasonable price. Tucked away in President Square strip mall anchored by 99 Ranch grocery store. It's my favorite spot in the strip mall's Food Court.

Definately worth the find. The menu covers just about every Korean comfort food imaginable. I've had at least half of their almost 30 menu items and I can honestly say that all were good if not great.

Very nice lady always treats you kindly. You can order in advance by phone or Online for convenience.

Awesome place to get your K-food fix.< /text><date>1534046404370< /date><user_id>109012665056611968305< /user_id>< Pictures>

<text>Tasty and reasonably priced Korean comfort food.  Friendly ladies working at the counter.  Let's you choose 3 side dishes from a decent selection. This is a food court, so set your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, I think the food is comparable if not better than most Korean offering in SGV.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Craving for Korean food, Ktown Express will be a place for you. The foods here are inexpensive and very decent. My wife and I have tired some of their dishes and they are pretty excellent, except for JaJangMyeon, it is my least favorite. I especially love their Mul-NeangMyeon, and my wife love their YukGaeJang & Bulgogi. I would definitely recommend this small Korean food stall located at the Arcadia 99 Ranch plaza food court to anyone who wants a quick decent inexpensive Korean cuisine. By the way, you can even order the foods online.</text>< pics>

Been coming here for a while now. I eat at the real Koreatown regularly, and I have to say the food here is just as good, if not better than most of the places I've been to. Highlights are the galbi tang, chicken noodle, and the pork ribs and potato soup.  Only downside I can think of is that sometimes they get too busy and the wait is long for a food court place.<//review>

Fast Korean food option in an otherwise chinese food court. Food quality is similar to Koreatown food court options (hence the name) without having to drive to Koreatown. You get between 2-5 banchan per entree.</Review>

Very fast service. Delicious food . Thai tea is the best here. And only bad thing is parking. This place is way faster than the one on Vermont.</Review>

I arrive at this special place once a month since I love the good air that is part of this place. The crew is highly loyal and experienced. The service is impressively quick. Needless to say, the food they cook is magnificent. I came often and I was never disappointed. The payment is modest. I recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.< /Text>

<Review>When I see bbq I think fire.  Pretty sure the ribs were only baked.  The sauce wasn't great and the squid didn't taste the freshest.  Service was good and they have plenty of outdoor seating.<//Review>< gmapID>

Love the food, atmosphere and staff. They offer great service, even when packed they still bring your food out in astounding time. Sometimes the food can be a little pricey but it is genuinely worth it. Great service, food and staff.< /review>

You can eat inside or outside. The biggest change is, you order at your table and then pay (so you better get it right the first time, lol). Although service was great and didn't wait much for my food, the soup was cold. Relied on the fire to heat it up, but it only went so far... so that brings me to a 4 star.<//text>

My total amount i order was $110.00 I paid 110.00 and they went behind my back and charge a extra 22.00 dollars for tips without my consent. They are bad people I called and spoke to the manager and he said he didn't care to put a lawsuit or to the call the police. SMH im so mad I work hard for my money.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I would recommend this place if your bringing family or just big gatherings. The plates that you order are usually shareable, because of the big portion. Since its COVID there is no dine in, but there is out door dining. You order than they will give you your receipt so that you can pay before you get the food. It does get very busy and the parking is hectic. Plan accordingly 😌 👌</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b89dfb672b09:0x2927d7051ad4f9ff< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I celebrated my graduation this evening in this gorgeous place. Well we had a delightful evening and the venue was undoubtedly one of the reasons for this happy evening. The team  collaborated in a pleasant style, the cooking was great and my friends were so  happy. We shall surely come back again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.<//Review>

< Review>
Oh my god this soup is so good. This place feeds the soul! It is super barebones so don't expect anything fancy but this way the food shines over all. We get the soup with brisket and extra noodles. It comes with kimchi and delicious rice that you dip into the soup. The service is friendly and warm. Will return regularly to satisfy our Korean soup cravings!< /Review>

<review>I bough a sea food soup, white rice, beef on a stick, and bbq pork ribs. They were ok. it's better when you dine in as the food is hot. Soup taste gross when it gets cold. Lastly make you check all your items before you leave. They tend to forget an item. This is in the morning when they don't have any customers.<//review>< time>

Found this Thai place on a Yelp Ad while hanging out by Ocean beach.  Very glad we decided to come here for lunch.  The place is very clean, the decor is nice and relaxing, and the service is great.< /text>

I used to go here as a child with my family. I had not been here in about thirteen years. It felt good. Food was good I recognized some of the staff which was nice. My favorite was seeing they still give the Tommy candy after you eat. Brought back my childhood.< /review>

Mmmmmmm. My new favorite thai in CA, ties with Lers Ros but for different dishes. The pork belly salad is a must order and is my new benchmark for what $13 is worth. Everything is delicious, especially their chef specials and more unique dishes. Even thai food aficionados will find something new and tasty here.</review>

<Review>It's really good. It's my wife's favorite place to eat. Every time I go there I feel like I'm in a central American country, because that's who the main demographic is. They love that stuff. Which is why my wife loves it. If it was my favorite, I'd give that coveted fifth star.< /Review>< Pictures>

I used to really love this place, unfortunately over the years the food quality has dropped. The orange chicken is not what it used to be and the shrimp and mushroom soup has lost its quality. I can say it is better than many thai places but for some who has been coming here for 22 years I was able to witness the quality become poor.</Text>

Services was horrible
When we arrived we got sat fast they  brought out our drinks first.  Our food took more than 15 min it was cold when we got it. I complained and they took our food away and made us wait another 10 min for our food. This restaurant needs better customer services . Food was pretty good .<//Text>

Food Was Decent However The Service Was Less Than Welcoming.  Upon Ordering Our Drinks Were Forgotten And Our Main Dishes Arrived As If The Chef Had Anticipated Our Order.  Our Order Arrived Within Minutes Of Us Sitting Down. We Left After The Waitress Literally Walked By And Placed Our Check On The Table.  Didn't Ask If We Were Done Or If We'd Like Anything Else. Didn't Bother To Ask If We Wanted Any Boxes For The Leftovers, Nothing.  She Was Very Stoic And Expressionless. We Left The Leftovers There, Paid And Walked Out.  Never Coming Back.</Text>

< Review>
I used to really love this place, unfortunately over the years the food quality has dropped. The orange chicken is not what it used to be and the shrimp and mushroom soup has lost its quality. I can say it is better than many thai places but for some who has been coming here for 22 years I was able to witness the quality become poor.< /Review>

< Review>
Worse service i called and asked how long it was gonna take for a order to be ready she told me about 1hr we got there 1hr later the order wasnt ready they made my husband pay and gave him a number 98 i saw that people who came after us were leaving and about 45 minutes later my husband hear they calling number 5 and 7 to pick up and our order wasnt ready yet. We waisted 1hr and i order there because the other ocha told me 1hr30min to 1hr45min i know the other ocha would have had my order by the time they told not like this one.< /Review>

Very delicious food also wonderful service. I've been coming here for years an the food never disappoints me. My son enjoys the seafood soup with steamed rice very delicious, he can't get enough of it. The rice noodle, Chow Fun with shrimps and Chinese broccoli is tasty.<//Review>

This place is flat-out the best, fantastic, outstanding, magnificent all in one. The 7 Mares soup here is supper, added with a side chili they have there, it's the best! I honestly love this place, I've been coming here for the past 13 years and even though I have moved on from the area I still find the time to travel just to eat there.< /review>

I always go to the one in Vermont but I accidentally ordered over the phone to this one so I just picked it up. I asked them if the food was fresh and hot and they said it just came out so I said hey great and paid the 65 dollars .they hand me the bags and go to my car and start driving but I had a feeling it was not hot so I decided to check it so I pull over and the food was warm more on the cold side. Had to be out for over 40 minutes. I told them I was going to pick the food at a specific time so that I didn't get cold food and yet they still took the food out way before I asked. Never coming here again. I'll stick to the Ocha on Vermont.</review>

Delicious, amazing, fantastic Thai food! I always come here with the family. We love it so much! Best soups and orange chicken here. Not too long of a wait to get your food, and everything is tasty!</review>

Food was great as usual. Always get the soup and rice there. It's great for a family on a budget too. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to our server forgetting our drinks and taking a while in refills. Happens once in a while.<//text>

Average food and service. I wasn't really impressed by the food quality. The chicken dish had very little actual chicken in it but was marked up to over $10 for the entree. Seems to get a crowd that doesn't care about it being high quality. Mostly immigrants that don't have lots of money for their big night out.< /Text>

Ocha is one of my favorite l.a restaurants
Staff is like what ever they get a lot of the order wrong but it does t matter cause usually it's the drinks only.
This specific place doesnt get too crowded so that good

But ur not there for the staff or the environment. You ate there for their 7 mares soup, mixed chowmin , and rice .... if u live in l.a u must eat here at least once<//Text>

Good place for food. It's a little expensive base of the presentation of the food but it is what it is. Over all 4/5
Side note, the waiters are fast and very attentive to everyone.</text>

I went here with a friend. We had the Shrimp with Cashew Nuts and Chili and Spicy Beef Bamboo Shoot with coconut cream. Both were good and delicious. Food serving is good for two person. We end our meal with Thai ice coffee.< /review>

The food was incredible! As someone who lived in Thailand a few years ago, I found Nan to be really a very very good, authentic place. Not sure I agree with other reviews regarding the decor though, I found it plain and boring. The most recent time we were there, the service wasn't perfect, but still good.
My recommendations are the sea bass and the lamb shank. And steal some of your neighbors curry sauce for diversity.< /Review>

<time>1467617436291< /time><text>Good food and decent ambience. Reasonable price and service. Trouble is waiting, they seem understaffed when it comes to attend to the long queue waiting outside, to be seated...wish they  could do something about that. I visit here once a month or two as it is close to where I live. Visiting since 2014.< /text><Name>ABHIJEET SARKAR</Name><gmap_id>0x80c2b89dfb672b09:0x2927d7051ad4f9ff< /gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Seafood soup tastes like hot water with lemon and salt. Fried rice tastes like Vons boxed rice. Cat Fish is hard and chewy. Service is slow and servers are disrespectful. This place used to be very good. My father met the owner back in the 80’s and my dad loved the food. Now he comes back today and says what am I eating. Very bad restaurant. The only “classic” and “traditional” thing about it is the look nothing else really. This food is not authentic Thai. Go to a Thai House in Monterey Park, now that’s authentic Thai.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Food is acceptable but the restaurant is dingy looking.
The parking is a nightmare and sometimes the wait is too long.
Prices a great versus quantity.< /Review>

<review>The place is kind of run-down looking.

There is a wide variation in quality of the food. Some dishes look and smell great, and others don't. It seems like the same dish varies a lot from one day to the next.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b89dfb672b09:0x2927d7051ad4f9ff</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>Although this restaurant claims that it serves authentic Chinese and Thai food, the food is no way closer to the said nations. The food was bland and not freshly prepared. Ordered pork with garlic and basil but ended up getting chicken with garlic and basil leaves. Ordered the Thailand signature chillies and fish sauce, but was served a sauce similar to green chillie sauce. The restrooms were filled with graffiti. However this place for locals to hangout.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b89dfb672b09:0x2927d7051ad4f9ff</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
The service was horrendous, and the food even worse than the service. The food is pre-made, and the sea food soup smelled extremely bad. I don’t get how this restaurant can have good reviews because it isn’t worth spending so much money on food that doesn’t taste good or smells good. The place is also dirty, the bathroom extremely disgusting.<//review>

Food is fantastic.
It takes a while to get a table if you are having dinner but it's worth the wait.</Review>

Terrible service I barely rate a place, but everytime i want to give another chance at this place, the service worsen..  Lack of good customer service.  Almost as if they dont know how to treat customers. Idk if its a culture or language issue but, why will you deny service or waiting seat to anyone who has been waiting and hr for service. Mind you quiet and patient.< /review>

Well there is kind of a wait before entering the restaurant and when we got our soup there was a hair and they replaced with a new one but I found a hair again in my soup! Service is great but their food should be examined<//review>

I've always loved this Ocha Thai Classic since I was small,  and I never changed location, they are always nice to me and my family, and always get the order correct and on time for when I order over the phone or even when I'm eating there with my family.< /Review>

Bad service I waited 5 mins and no one noticed me Until I had to ask for the manager for assistance. And they were not busy with waiters standing around . The food is really good but service is so so. I would deff. go by myself , I wouldn't recommend this place to friends being that you may get emburressed for recommending it to your friends with such bad service.. I've been once before and the same thing the serive was so so< /review>

Food is good only when is arrives to your table before it gets cold. Service is OK other than sometimes when they're busy you can wait for a coffee refilled a long time< /Text>

Food is not bad nor that good. However, one of the employees suggested not to tip since this place keeps all the tips. Tips are for employees not the restaurant.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The quantity is generous and the price is low. There is a parking lot, but if there are many cars, you have to wait. Staff are friendly.
Tomyangkung is the main. It is characterized by adding coconut.

(Original)
양이 푸짐하고 가격이 저렴하다. 주차장이 있지만 차가 많으면 기다려야한다. 직원들은 친절하다.
똠양꿍이 메인이다. 코코넛을 넣은 것이 특징이다.</review>

(Translated by Google) The two Thai restaurants add to the typical American Powerhouse Restaurant!
Great value for money
The menu is varied and suitable for wider space can accommodate guests for groups to the top
The food is not special at all and alright!

(Original)
전형적인 아메리칸 차이니스 음식점에 태국음식이 추가된 레스토랑!
가격대비 양이 푸짐하여 가성비가 훌륭합니다
메뉴도 다양하고 손님을 수용할수 있는 공간이 넓어 단체손님이 가기에 적합합니다
음식은 전체적으로 특별하진않고 무난합니다 !<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The food is good in the place, they are good the dishes that they serve, good products, they have quality and quantity. The staff takes good care of you only that they put pressure on you at the time of ordering.
Take the time that you think it is necessary to read the wide menu that they offer, since it is not easy to choose one of the almost 100 that come in the menu.
I recommend the 7 seas, the cold thai and the noodles whether you order them with any type of meat or vegetables.

A service dog is state certified and must bring a badge ...
The food was 2 than 3

(Translated by Google) Aaaah is not a good place, there are better in this type of food. I really do not recommend it. There are many things found, 1) parking is limited. 2) they pressure you to eat fast so you can vacate the table and then the waiters are not friendly and do not allow you to tip the few Latinos who work there picking up dirty dishes and cleaning the tables.

(Original)
Aaaah no es un buen lugar, hay mejores en este tipo de comida. En verdad no lo recomiendo. Son muchas las cosas encontra, 1) el parqueo es limitado. 2) te presionan para que comas rapido para que desocupes la mesa y luego los meseros/as no son nada de amables y no te permiten darle propina a los pocos latinos que trabajan ahi recogiendo las platos sucios y limpiando las mesas.</Review>
