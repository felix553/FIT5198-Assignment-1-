Love this place! Went the first time while visiting last year & came back again once I moved to LA. The food & service was great each time - love the happy hour deals & outdoor seating options. I plan to come back every time I'm around the Venice Beach area!</Text>

<time>1617190381195</time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>So I never knew this place had a gorgonzola burger that was fire until a couple weeks ago. Now sometimes I think about it in the middle of my week like a beautiful humble woman I met out day drinking.  (I hope I see her soon) This place has the best most hospitable local friendly staff from the hostess and door guy miguel (who is very knowledgeable about the local happenings) to the "Mr I can get you anything you want to make you feel welcome guy" I think his name was Will. Very good experience. Can't wait to go back.  Best local place around with excellent food.<//Review>< Pictures>

Such a gem! Went to Mercedes for the first time last night and it was an overall amazing experience. From the food we ordered (Mojo Chicken, Chimichurri Shrimp, Chicken Enchiladas, and Citrus Salmon- ALL AMAZING) to the service which made you feel like you’re at dinner at a friend’s or family’s house, it’s a place you’ll definitely return to.

Thanks to everyone that made us feel so special and hats off to the chef. See you again soon!</Text>

A Fun Place! In this restaurant, I really had a nice time and a full tummy, and thanks to the servers who attended to all of my orders. The food is really good here, and the service is very commendable. I couldn't ask these guys for more, because I was very pleased with the food and service. Nicely done!</review>

<review>Fantastic brunch spot. We went there in January on a break from the NAMM Convention. After walking from the hotel we stumbled upon this place and right from the get go it looks like a perfect place of something vibrant yet something cool and calm. And it was just that. Staff were excellent informative cool and casual. The cuisine was modern American Latino and other infusions of West Coast flair and food. I would not hesitate to go back there. In fact I will be going back there it’s just a matter of when this damn pandemic lets us back into this amazing part of America and this amazing part of LA area.
I had the eggs Benny. And it was perfect.<//review>< Pics>

Neat place to catch a beer and view. Food has to be ordered with a drink. We had the Spinach and Artichoke dip and it was pretty good. Great service and shaded outdoor seating available.< /Text>

<review>A very nice menu at a great location almost right on the beach!

The staff was friendly and the restaurant was nice. A little squishy with the seating but not too bad.

The food me and my partner ordered was vegetarian that we’ve never had the option to try before. Plant based chorizo and a unnpesto feta plant based burger. Very good!!
The plantain was a great touch, it was blackened nicely and carried a big flavour.

I would recommended this place for a nicer meal in the area!</review>< Pictures>

<user_id>105234362170523652866</user_id><user_name>andrew saetern<//user_name><review>A buddy of mine was visiting from Idaho and I took him out to Venice for dinner. Mercede's Grille seemed like a good option so we walked in for a late dinner. It was a slow Wednesday night, but it looked like they had their fair share of regulars. They were very friendly with the bartender. We sat at the bar. I had the Fish & Chips with an iced tea. It was delicious Fish & Chips, but super heavy for this time of day. The fries were fresh and crispy too.

Service was fast, as it was a slow night. Parking was easy at this time of the night. A bit pricy, but understandable since it's located along the beach. Worth giving a try if you're in the area. Your meal can be followed by a walk along the beach, day or night.</review></record></dataset><record>

Best tortilla chips! I am not a tortilla chip person, but I could not stop eating them! Every restaurant claims they make their chips fresh, but they do not taste like this place! Order the shrimp ceviche.. you will not be disappointed!</text>< Pics>

<Text>Food was nice. Cocktails so so, Moscow Mule was far from what you get in the bars. Waitress was very nice and helpful! I would rate it 4 stars but... I left restaurant for the beach and came one hour later because I needed restroom and security guy didn’t let me in(( He said if they let everyone in, there would be thousands of people in the restroom, but come on, I was your client one hour ago (I told them) , not yesterday, I spend 100$ on cocktails in your restaurant, and you know what? Now I need a restroom! They didn’t let me in and it caused so much inconvenience for me(< /Text>< response>

Ambience and decor : 5/5
Accessibility and location : 5/5
Food : 5/5
Service : 5/5
Price : $
Value for $ : Definitely yes 😊👍

My experience:

Me and my husband popped in for lunch at Mercede's. We were greeted by friendly staff and seated in the wonderful outdoor seating right away! Service was quick and prompt. Our server made sure we were comfortable.
Food ordered:
Truffle fries - 5/5 ..extra points to the habanero aioli👍
Hibiscus tacos - 5/5 😃It is a must try👍
Overall, the experience was amazing.
Will definitely visit again.</text>

<Review>Great food, good drinks, and great service! The food was excellent! Delicious!!! Great portions. A little pricey to me but maybe not for L.A. I was visiting. We had a great bartender. Pretty lady who gave excellent service to us tourists. The vibe was great and full oh people laughing, drinking and happy. This has become a new staple for me. Whenever I'm in town, I'll be back!!!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>Colton Lapp</user_name><Review>Me and my parents stopped into this place last Sunday and it was by far the best food we had in LA all weekend - so flavorful and delicious. Half the menu was authentic (as far as I can tell) Cuban food and half was slightly more expensive fresh seafood/seafood hybrid items, it seemed like there was something for everyone. Me and my parents all asked the (very nice) waitress for recommendations on her favorite cuban dishes and all three were amazing and so different. We left so full and so happy, and proceeded to talk about the food all weekend. Definitely go if you get the chance - the ambiance is quite nice as well, although people were a little more drunk than I expected in a place as well decorated as it was.</Review>< rate>

<review>Food is always great, seems like it's always full of off-duty, retired, or just plain-clothed cops talking about past narcotics cases.  Kind of weird but this cash only restaurant is still one of my favorite places to get food in the city.  I always have leftovers and I always leave full.  Comfort foods, no preservatives and nothing too fancy.</review>< pics>

Found this restaurant randomly while visiting Venice Beach and was completely wowed. Every dish was delicious, flavorful and authentic.

From Cuban coffee, breakfast muffins to the entrees our party of four ordered, there were raves all around. Great service, ambiance, I would highly recommend.</Text>

<text>Came here off of a recommendation and was happy I did, the food was amazing and the staff very friendly.

I recommend any of the dishes with pork as well as the hibiscus tacos, that's mainly because that's what I tried but everything looked really good! Plantains were amazing.

The atmosphere was good enough but then the food... Amazing! I had the Cuban pork enchiladas and it was tender. The avocado, cheese, and tortilla didn't overpower the pork which was perfect. The wait staff was extremely nice and professional. If I am ever back, I will for sure come back.<//Review>

Oh how I love this amazing balance of cultural beauty. From the people to the amazing Amanda this place is one heaven on earth. Steps away from the sunset, eat and then go watch it. Or watch it then come eat.. The order doesn't matter as long as you eat at Mercedes. Hands down, best kept secret in town.< /Text>

I asked the host when I walked in if this was a Cuban restaurant and he replied yes. This is definitely not a Cuban restaurant. I was so looking forward to authentic Cuban food but that sure wasn’t it . The breakfast was smothered with some greasy cheddar cheese that was so thick I had to peel it off in order to eat it. The rice was dry and the beans did not have a Cuban flavor more a Mexican flavor.  The sour cream had some weird consistency like it was curdled.  I would’ve told them what I thought but they never even checked to see how I was doing. Total disappointment!<//text>

Awesome Awesome Awesome! They catered for small gathering I had. Everyone raved about the food. Jerk chicken and yellow rice. It was all seasoned very well. I didn't have to add salt or anything or any seasoning...I'm the type that will throw some seasoning on a meal if it AINT right lol.  Will definitely be going back here.< /review>

Consequently, when the food came, they had to take it back to the kitchen. Someone drove up in a car with her puppy that she started petting and playing with out in the street. She then returned and handled people's food without washing her hands. Once again she returned outside to play with the puppy. She then shocked us by having it follow her into the restaurant at 11 pm with many people drinking on a Saturday night. Someone could have stepped on the puppy and injured it.

Excellent experience! Very friendly staff, good music playing, and the most important: great food. If it's really Cuban or not, I can't say, but it was very tasty.<//text>

Bonus point if you go for sunset and get a seat outside by windows.< /review>< date>

Excellent!
Garlic chicken

Only 1 bad experience with a bad waitress, but typically, the waiters are EXCELLENT!!< /text>

The Breakfast is Absolutely Amazing! I ate here twice this week. I ordered a mimosa and the Politically Correct Omelet drizzled with cuban sauce, but I did substitute the goat cheese with cheddar cheese. I've also shared the fresh mango and also the blueberry pancakes with my husband.<//text>

<Text>Sunset at Mercede's.just amazing.
We had a couple of Mojitos and tried the Spinach&Artichoke Dip and the Picadillo Bartolitto.small portions but just enough.
Tasty and not expensive.
Cocktails were pretty strong(thank God)...:-)</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) I loved the food. Very good value for money and the quantity also adequate. The waiter who looked after us or knew almost Spanish but was lovely as well as gorgeous. The place very crowded and with very good atmosphere

<text>(Translated by Google) The location is beautiful but the food and drinks were really not tasty.
The sangria was sour and sour and the snacks were actually not to eat.
There was a menu on the table that was back a month ago, so other dishes and different prices, so we paid far too much afterwards.

(Original)
De locatie is schitterend maar het eten en drinken was echt niet lekker.
De sangria was wrang en zurig en de snacks waren eigenlijk niet te eten.
Er stond een menukaart op de tafel die van een maand terug was, dus andere gerechten en andere prijzen, achteraf hebben we dus veel te veel betaald.< /text>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) Located very close to the pier.
A place that invites you to enter, with a small letter but well prepared and presented the dishes.
Good attention.

<review>The store is really clean and open. I really dislike going to get things printed, there are always issues but here with Wendy, she is super helpful and tries her best to make it work and make sure I leave happy or at least as happy as possible. Thanks Wendy for being a great and patient employee, I don't think I'd come here if she stopped working here so give her a raise. :D Today I went in with something that Staples couldn't figure out for the second day because the image wouldn't align and Wendy to the rescue she figured it out!</review>< Pictures>

I was in the store the other day to have some things printed because my laptop is wacked.  The nice ladies there advised that I bring in my laptop and have them do a free scan.  I did and the representative (John) advised that he can fix it, tons of malware slowing it down etc.  I picked it up today and it is AWESOME!!   They are really good folks over there and I recommend them!! Thank You John, my computer is screaming fast now!!<//text>

Was kept waiting in a line behind a lady ordering something offline for 20 minutes while 3 other associates stood behind the counter talking. All I wanted was some whiteout. I should have gone to a different store in the Plaza instead.<//Review>

Upon coming home, I reviewed my invoice re items that were supposedly checked.  Several item were marked as such which was blatantly untrue . Also, I was assured that 2 coupons would be honored,  however only one was. My first time here, Adam, my service guy was very polite, yet his supervisor seemed to be more interested in pushing customers through for the sake of expediency rather than attention to quality of service and attention to detail.< /text>

<Text>Had a great experience here. Marco helped me out and was very kind and professional. Recently I got an oil change at the Jiffy Lube in Encinitas, CA. They forgot to put the gasket on so I drove to laguna with oil dripping and burning. Wasn’t until someone told me there was smoke coming from my exhaust that i pulled over. Anyways, Marco and his team got it done right and provided excellent customer service< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

My favorite Jiffy Lube to go! been taking my cars here for over 6 years and they been just great and on top of it and I never had any issues. Isaias knows exactly what to do with the cars and he handles everything super fast and professionally. Angel took care of my cars this time and everything went smooth and great!  Thank you all</text>

Just bad service. They dont honor their own posted coupons. Lots of places offering oil changes. Don’t waste your time with Jiffy Lube. They don’t do what they say they will do. Just bad experience.</review>

He denied my refund request and He got a quote to change the compressor for 640 Plus dollars. When I complaint all of a sudden it went down to 440 dollars. This point I knew I was being played for a fool. He told me to complaint to where ever I want to wish while I was leaving and I just got ripped of for $130 which I am not going to get.

Jiffy Lube, is this how do you treat your customers and let your workers treat customers with disrespect? the times could be tough but we also work hard to make our money...</review>< Pictures>

This is my spot for car maintenance. I have been here numerous times for more than just oil replacement and everyone I have worked with is kind, honest, professional, and the work is completed quickly.  I highly recommend it!< /review>

<review>My past experiences at this location have been positive except for them forgetting to close the lid on my husband’s oil and messed his car up. Even with that happening I have been back because it’s so close to home. Obviously, I should have realized that this location and Jiffy Lube cannot be trusted.

I had several service lights on but only went with an oil change. Maybe the lack of me going through with the over priced services is what lead to the mechanic BSing me or maybe it was the fact that I went in around 6:30 when they close at 7. Anyhow, I took my car to the mechanic today (one I have had for years and trust) and he let me know I needed an oil change. He said it looks like my oil filter was replaced but the oil that is in my car is extremely filthy. He informed that with an oil change, the oil should be drained and the new oil will look clear or at least somewhat clear. My oil was extremely dirty. This leads me and an experienced mechanic to believe I was deceived into paying over $50 for a service that was not provided to me as well not sure how many times this has occurred.Not only do I expect a refund, I do not believe Jiffy Lube services are truly what they say they are, and will no longer be a customer.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>107362319639008926906< /user_id>< Response>

The manager was such a big help when I came in, my break lights were installed wrong by the previous person. He spent almost an hour working on them and was able to fix my break lights. I appreciate the help all the manager staff provided, they saved me from having to buy all new taillights!  Thank you again!<//Review>

My wife had her brakes done out of town when we were in Vegas at the dealership, they screwed us over, we took it to Jiffy Lube and they did the job right, they replaced the rotors and put new pads all around. I was so pleased that I had them do the same for my car. Very affordable and less than an hour to do the work. They even gave us a 10% discount for being AAA members. If you need brakes go to them.<//text>

Fastest Oil Change I ever had!  Under 15 minutes - and right before a Holiday weekend!  With a newborn - it was much appreciated.  No price gauging ... recommendations were fair and market (or under) market price.  Byron and Daniel were quite helpful.</Review>

Please do not go here. These people scams you. They causes damage to your car and offers to fix for a prize. Also on there advertising bored it said a certain price for an oil change and they were saying a higher price. When i pointed it out he was apologizing. Please dont go here.</text>

On September 15, 2014 my Father brought in his 2007 Volvo to get a simple oil change. He brings his car to get an oil change every 5,000 miles as recommended. When he brought the car in, it was documented that there was nothing wrong with the car. As he drove him he heard strange sounds from the engine. Upon returning home he found oil all over underneath the car. When he tried to start the engine again it made a loud screeching sound that was deafening to the ears. The car wouldn't move, it was inoperable, and the engine was blown. He called Jiffy Lube to tell them what happened and they told him that he needed to bring it to a mechanic, and that they didn't do anything wrong to the car. With further persuasion they sent out a representative to look at the car while it was still at their house. By the time their representative arrived it was already loaded onto a tow truck, and ready to be towed into the Volvo dealership for further inspection. Jiffy Lube's representative went underneath the car without the permission of my Father, tools in hand, and tinkered with something under the car. Of course we are fearful that he was covering up something they had done wrong. The car went to the dealership, the Volvo mechanic's review of the car was that someone (Jiffy Lube), must have emptied the car of oil, and then ran the engine because there were shards of metal laced into the oil. Not only that but the oil in the car seemed to be dirty as well. The engine was shot, and it was in correlation due to something that had been done at Jiffy Lube. We reached out to Angel Torres, District Manager and reported what happened, he came out and looked at the car at the dealership and heard their review of what they thought had happened. He spoke to the employees that worked on the car and they confirmed that nothing was wrong with the car when it came in. He says that his employee that worked on the car denys anything going wrong while he worked on the car. Angel asked my Parents for proof that they had been maintaining the car properly (of course looking for a reason why this wasn't their fault). We found all of our records and have taken impeccable care of the car, and it was perfectly fine when my Father brought it in. Angel told us today that his employee says he did nothing wrong, and there's no proof that they caused the engine to die, and that he can't do anything for us. To help you imagine how we feel, consider what it would be like to go get your hair cut and colored, you leave the salon, and later at home you find that your hair is falling out in large clumps. You call the salon to report the problem, and they tell you that it isn't because of something they did. Now you understand. We are going to pursue legal action against Jiffy Lube. We do not recommend you go to this Jiffy Lube or any other for that matter. The mechanics (not all of them), but some of them obviously are not trained well, and shouldn't be working on people's cars. The company Jiffy Lube which makes millions, doesn't like to be held accountable for it's mistakes, and won't care if it ruins your car. Now my parents are down to 1 car. My Mom is disabled and very sick, she can't be left home without a car in case of emergency. My Father needs to go to work and so he has to take the one car they have now. My family has been put in a horrible situation because of their mistakes, and they have been left without any help.<//Text>

He assured me that it wouldn't be a problem and he saw no reason why he couldn't change the oil. After waiting 35 minutes I was informed that they could not, in fact, change the oil because they did not have the proper tools. They were not apologetic and in no way made me feel better about the time they had wasted. I would not recommend this place of business.</review>< Pics>

< review>
Service was quick and the staff were friendly, however this place will try to tell you that your car needs this and that, when in reality the vast majority of their recommendations are without merit, and the services they suggest are very unnecessary.  They attempted to upsell me on ridiculous services (which were obviously overpriced), and I watched one of the employees enter the waiting room two times to inform two female customers that something else was needed for their vehicles, and they talked up the business saying that it is the cheapest deal around in comparison to their competitors, which is undoubtedly untrue.  I was also advised to change my oil after 2,000 miles, which is far too soon for a full-synthetic oil change.  I was very friendly and agreed to a service which I know I didn't need, but I will not be returning in the future for the aforementioned reasons.</review>

Unfortunately I had a bad experience. The service included checking all fluids and filling them.

The service manager, gave me all possible options to get this or something else done, but did not mention anything about the brake fluids.

I had a light on in my Van, I googled, filled the brake fluid and problem went away. I wish the service team would have informed me or fixed it. I had complained this to Jiffy Lube but there was no comments from them.

so NO MORE Jiffy Lube. Sorry!!!< /Review>

< review>
Transco is always professional and great to work with. Customer service is top notch and Jeff and Dave are awesome to work with. We've had multiple cars worked on there and have always found them to be helpful, honest, and willing to work with us. Repairs are always expensive no matter where you go, and the guys at Transco have always checked in with what's needed and let us know how much it will cost and any alternatives that could save us money before we are hundreds into a job. I've recommended them to my family and friends who have also been very happy with their service. Glad to do business with them and they remain our go-to shop.</review>

My experience with Transco was excellent. I felt like all of my concerns were taken into account. A thorough diagnostic was done and I felt the work that needed to be performed was necessary. I felt like they were honest and had fair pricing.
I highly recommend Transco.< /review>

<Text>Of course, not happy that my transmission went out during this epidemic time, but it did. I did some shopping around and happened to stop in for a quote. Later, I was attempting to go home but then my transmission really went out and just barely make it back to Transco at 5:10. They were supposed to be closed but I just caught them leaving. They loaned me a car, and completely repaired (actually replaced) my transmission. My car has 125,000 miles on it and it drives better than new again with a new 100,000 warranty!! Jeff and David were so honest, knowledgeable, good at communicating the progress and reasonable. Like I said I did my research. If you have a transmission issue, go out of your way (if you transmission can get you there!) to Transco on Santa Rosa Ave., and ask for Jeff or David. Thank you again!!< /Text>< pics>

Last week I took my car to a shop to get it looked at and they recommended I take it to Transco because it was a problem with the transmission. I dropped it off and an hour later came back for the diagnosis. Dave informed me that it was not the transmission but the wheel bearings!! Other shops might have found a more expensive "problem" with my car but he was very honest about the diagnosis. He gave me a reasonable price quote and asked if I would like to have the work done. I decided to go for it and when I told Dave to go ahead he was very enthusiastic and told me that he would have it running like new! It's great to see a mechanic that enjoys their work and takes pride in doing it right.

I am very happy to say that a week later my cars runs like new as promised! I am extremely happy with the work done and will highly recommend Transco to all my friends. I will be taking my car there for any future repairs. Thanks guys!</Review>< Pictures>

The transmission had very hard shirts to the point where I thought it would break U joints. Santa Rosa Transmission was the recommended warranty center, so I took it over there to get evaluated. Santa Rosa Transmission told me that that's normal for this transmission and I should have bought a better one. I took it to Transco to get a second opinion and they found a vacuum leak from the EGR valve that was not allowing the transmission to shift correctly. I thank Transco for their knowledge and thinking outside of just the transmission. You guys are great.  Transmission shifts smooth now.< /text>< user_id>

My car computer shut down my car in parking lot on a Saturday. Transco was about only shop open. Their engine diagnostics indicated my 2004 Trailblazer needed new computer and they got job done for me and have not had any issues for last 6 months. Nice people too.</review>

<review>Extremely happy with the work they did on my car. Called around for prices and checked reviews for a few days before I decided to go into the shop to meet them.  I would never bring my car into a shop for anything, unless I get a good vibe from the people working there. I felt very comfortable right away and brought my car in. I needed a new clutch and  everyone who drives a clutch  knows how difficult some clutches are and pray that after the repair, their car will be just as comfortable to drive. When I got my car back I was so happy that my clutch felt exactly the same. What was also interesting to me was they wanted to see the car again in 15 days to make sure everything was working right.  These guys deserve 5 stars from everyone! anyone giving them less than 4 stars don't understand the time and effort it takes for a job done right! If you love your car and want your car done right from people who care and have great prices,  this is the shop for you.< /review>< pictures>

Awesome service!!!! I went to several transmission shops in search for the fastest and cheapest service and thankfully found transco! My experience was amazing! Dave the owner was so helpful and honest. I'm a young girl that doesn't know too much about cars so it was nice to be in a place that didn't try to con me into outrageous prices like the others!! I'm so grateful I found them because now I can drive around worry free :)< /Text>

Transco has rebuilt the transmissions two of my vehicles in the last five years, a 2002 Volvo and a 2004 Honda.  Both have been running perfectly ever since.  They also do the regular maintenance and service on my cars and I'm quite satisfied.  David and Jason are a pleasure to work with, fair, and the pricing is reasonable.  I have found that their decades of experience have saved me a load of money by finding the simple fix, rather than telling me I need a new transmission or something.</text>

Had a 94 Mitsubishi 3000GT that ran fine until i brought it Transco and now it hardly runs and has more issues which include a ground wire getting so hot it caught fire from the engine to the fire wall. I now have the car at a Mitsubishi dealer I paid roughly about 2 grand to have my car molested and than they wouldn't even hold their warranty on the service they did and charged me again to fix their mistakes. Nice people but won't be doing business with them anymore. They seemed more interested in pushing other people's cars through the shop and just let mine sit there for a week than referring me to another garage where the work could be performed properly and in a timely manner.
UPDATE Mitsubishi dealer confirms error on last techs behalf don't take your car to these idiots.<//text>

<Response>{'time': 1461965813668, 'text': 'Dear Mr. DeBruyne, I am writing this in response to the review you posted.  You brought your 94\' 3000GT Mitsubishi to our shop with a badly slipping clutch and a loud clunking noise coming from the transmission.  You stated that the car had been sitting for months prior to you coming to our shop for service.\n\nWe installed a brand new clutch.  You provided us with a "used" transmission that you asked us to swap out with the one currently in your vehicle.  Reluctantly, we did the transmission swap and on February 24th you picked up your vehicle, drove away with the car working fine.\n\nOn February 25th you contacted us again, this time the engine was overheating and it would not start.  We towed your car back in for diagnostics.  We found a code for the crank sensor, which we replaced and the car was able to start but was still running rough.  Please remember, the original work was for the clutch and transmission, not the engine.\n\nIn an effort to help with Mr. DeBruyne’s bill, we discounted our labor costs.  He stated that he did not have a budget for the engine problem to be repaired.  He said that he would work on that problem himself.  If necessary he would return at a later date when it became affordable. We felt bad for his situation; did everything that we could to try and help him.  It is unfortunate that he was having so many issues with his 22 year old vehicle.\n\nWe aim to satisfy our customers.  Please let us know if we can be of any further assistance.'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x8084481ecb286ce3:0x9621a5cee38c4ec2< /Gmap_id></record>

When I reached 275,000 miles on my BMW, I recently had Transco overhaul the transmission in my 1992 5.25i Touring Wagon.  The transmission had been slowly failing for about a year and when it only backed up when it wanted to, I knew it was time to repair it.  It was a tough call, as the car had reached the end of its economic life, so to speak.  When I first took it in to the shop, David and Jason both took a look at it, drove it, and put it up on the rack for a look see.  To me a transmission is something foreign and mysterious, but they took the time to talk with me about the problems and how they would go about fixing it.  I felt so confident in their skills and experience that I just told them to go ahead and fix it.  It took nearly a week for them to take it all apart, clean it, analyze the issues, get a rebuild kit, and put it all back together.  But, wow!  When I drove it the first time it was like I was back in Germany cruising through the mountains again.  Smooth as butter.  It shifted at exactly the speed the manual said it should for each gear. David went from high school right to transmission school, so transmissions have been his whole life and it shows in the attention to detail.  The employees have all been there for years and that tells you a lot.  The shop is clean and tidy and that is a real challenge in that business.

The long and the short of it is that I strongly recommend you consider Transco should you have transmission problems.  They work on cars, trucks, and also handle all other automotive problems you may have.  They also replaced my brake systems' master cylinder and the brake work beautifully.</Text>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>I just spent $10,000. to repair the botched rebuild job performed by Transco.  They ruined the case by drilling out the pinion nut, put the wrong number of frictions in the clutch and drums, and used the wrong shims so the ball vent was smashed.  The shop that repaired my transmission after only 12,337 miles said they were amazed it lasted as long as it did.  Have contacted Transco, and of course have had no response.  If you have a German transaxle, don't take it to these guys.

Wow! I cannot believe the quality of service we received from David Vigil, and his crew.  I own a 2015 Ford Focus which had a recall on the transmission unit.  Even though the unit was under warrenty FORD was going to charge me ove $6K to get the repair done. I talked to Mr. Vigil to explain the situation and he asked that I somehow get the vehicle to him.  Thankfully, I had AAA and was able to get it towed for a second evaluation.  That $6K ended costing me und $2K to get a transmission problem solved thanks to the efforts and diligence of a trusted transmission repair speclist David and his team that went beyond their expertise to resolve a prolem they initially could not figure out but went to great lenghts to find the problem and resolved with a solution!   My Ford Focus is now running with quite a beautiful rev....and is a happy motor!   Thank you David and his Team for taking such good care of me and my vehicle!  We love you!< /Text>

Great detail for a reasonable price. Great service. Arrived a few minutes early and the staff was ready to go. My car looked great when staff was done and he delivered it back to my home. Would definitely use it again. Thanks for making my car look new again.<//review>

Great quality and fast service. Employees are very respectful. Got a hand wash and wax and it came out great with no left over residue. Would definitely recommend.</review>

<Text>Extremely unprofessional. I gave my car on a Saturday at 1pm and they told me it's a busy day and hence they would be able to give the car back only by 6pm. And I told them I am fine with it as long as today.

I did not get a call till 5.20 and that's when I started calling them repeatedly from 5.20-5.45 and no one picked up. I then worried about the car ended up going to the location only to find the whole place locked and my car parked inside.

Next day again I started calling them at 9 am and they picked up my call only at 11 am after multiple tries. They then told me the car is ready.

Really really bad customer service. The least you can expect is communication even if there is a delay.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcc7797814ee5:0xab8a3c5f916ed1c2< /Gmap_id></record>

This place reeks of disrespect. The boss has absolutely no respect for anybody other than himself. I would not recommend anyone who needs more than a regular wash (which can easily be done even better at machine washes) to go here. You will pay a premium for low-quality services and an awful attitude.

I paid for a $180 package which supposedly was original $250. The owner said it should take around 2 hours. Turns out, it was rushed and finished in less than 50 minutes. When I got home, I noticed that there were water stains all over the interior of the seats, and the exterior of the car was barely cleaned! Especially around the socket of the tires (and this is what I mean by a machine wash could do a better job).

The owner had the "courtesy“ for allowing me to take my car back the second day (perhaps due to him also feeling like he charged accessive money). Yet halfway through the process, he started disrespecting me, cursing at me, threatening me, pushing me around (where surveillance wasn't covering), and eventually having the guts to call the cops on me.

Btw, the owner also threatened to kill me, "fxxk" me up if he saw me on the street.

This would be the exact opposite of professionalism, value, or quality.
I was unfortunate to have chosen this place due to COVID 19 limiting my choices, but I hope this review can save you guys a whole lot of trouble.
I do feel bad for the staff though, feels like they were suppressed and depressed.< /text>

<text>Hard working group of individuals.  I paid $40 for "regular service" and gave them a $10 tip.  My car looked almost as new as when I first bought it. The workers were very professional and polite.

<text>I'm sorry that I had to give you 1 star but I'm really upset about the services that I received from you. I paid $42.00 for the full car wash package (interior included). I agreed that outside are clean - ofcourse but inside, the dashboard is so dirty, I also can see the coffee that I accidently dropped on my car seats, it still there. I'm not sure that staffs cleaned them or not... I have to say that the fee is expensive and not worthy to spend that much when seeing your car's still dirty.<//text>< Pics>

Good car wash. A little expensive, but still good place to wash your car. Owner operated, in my opinion that’s plus. On Friday they have a deal: full car was + wax for $69.99. I found it a good deal. Good location, right off 880 freeway. Fast and quality service.</text>

They were extremely thorough, and I could not be happier with the results. My car was epically filthy when I brought it in, and it’s spotless now. They even got tea and soda spills out of the seats that I thought were permanent stains. I definitely recommend Prolago!<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>More expensive than most, but a truly good job.  When I pulled in I asked the lady "How much" and she had to ask someone else that said $28.  A bit high, but did not want to go elsewhere.  I did not notice the sign that said $38 for SUV (I had a Lexus SUV; smaller than some, but larger than a sedan).  When I checked out I told the owner of the discrepancy and he immediately went for the $28.  I inquired about price, and he pointed out car washes now have to have a very high bond, higher than auto dealers, etc.  I mentioned that the car wash that was at Lawrence & Stevens Creek did as good a job, but went out of business.  I indicated he knew of that place and that it got too expensive for them.  He signed me up for membership, and agreed to $28 in the future.  I'll be back in a few weeks and see if he honors that price.  For $28, well worth it.  But $38 seems out of line to me.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcc7797814ee5:0xab8a3c5f916ed1c2< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Response>None</Response><Review>No one likes being screwed over by shoddy businesses, and this is a fair warning to whoever wants to do business with these guys.  I dropped my car for detailing and was told to pick it up after 2 hours.  I came back after 3 and it had not been touched.  I gave them an hour more and came back to see that they had only done the interior and not even washed my car.
After complaining to the guy in charge there, he said he could not help it and it had been a busy day.  So 4 hours later, I sat 30 more minutes waiting and seeing my unwashed car being 'detailed'.  I know the difference between a washed and unwashed car.  My complain about washing the car didn't go anywhere.  In short, I paid $120 for a shoddy touch up on the exterior without even a wash.  Fair to say this was my last time here; need to find a more honest place next time.< /Review>< name>

<review>This is an amazing place to give your car the TLC it deserves. They only use high pressure washer for the rims. Using low pressure on the body helps protect paint that has been chipped. They took their time to dry the car very well. I couldn't be happier with the service!</review></record>

<Review>Don't come here! I don't recommend this service at all. It's un-professional  with a bunch of KIDS doing the jobs like they have summer part time jobs.  The price was not cheap, so, don't expect to get any trade off from their quick-doings.  I had my car wash with $38 service, in and out, but when it's done after 30 mins, there's still full of dust on the air vent and cup holders, back seat hand rest area, and in the trunk. You'd better have your car washed at a touch-less station rather than here! Save money!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I never write reviews. But I have to share this. This car wash sucks. I went there just to get a quick car wash. After they were done, I was very surprised to find a lot of remaining spots on the car. They said that it would need 45 minutes to clean this! I ended up cleaning those myself using a microfiber cloth within 1/2 minute. After talking to the manager he said that if I didnt like the service, I shouldnt go back! Well he is right about that. I shouldnt! Total waste of money. I would give it 0 star if I could.</Text>

<review>Best service and price close to Milpitas. Went there today (Mon) around 9:30am and took 20 mins to finish. The car was cleaned up well inside out including the trunk. They were so kind to remove couple light scratches from side door without additional cost as well, definitely will go next time again. Paid $28 for regular service cause that's all I need, definitely well worth it.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

May 15 at 2:29 PM I thought I would try out the car wash since I live close by
I told the owner I was a first timer
It was $36 for a hand car wash
There were four Hispanic guys washing my vehicle
When they were done they handed me the keys
Not one of them washed my hood or the top of my truck
So I had to get a cloth from them and wipe it down with the manager
Next time I will have to do the truck wash myself

Thanks but no thanks<//Text>

Don't take your car here because if something happens they will call you a liar and not fix it.  I decided to get a Groupon and try this place out. I had a paint rub on my car and decided to take it in on a Friday for them to look at it before I got my detail on Monday.  They did a quick buff and said yes they could get it out.  Immediately I went to get gas and found out that I could not get my gas door opened to get gas  because it was pushed in from the buffing.  We immediately called them (and found a temporary way of opening the door) and left a message about what happened and we would be in on Monday morning.  When we came the owner called us a liar and said we had never been there (disputed by his employees).  Then he said we were liars and was arguing with us saying he would not fix it because then he would be responsible for it.  Really?  He was already responsible for it.  He was rude and unprofessional.  It would have been an easy fix for the company's and that is all I wanted.  Now it have to pay to fix there error. As a small business owner I am appalled at how unethical this place is.  Enter Prolago at your own risk!  Or rather go elsewhere to an ethical Auto Detailer.<//Text>

Hand wash was really a hand wash and not like at other places. The price for regular wash is $28 for my sedan but they clean the car very nicely.<//review>

I can honestly say this is one of the best carwash places that I have been too. While driving I had to make a sudden break & spilled pozole (red soup) on the back seat of my car & this stuff stains & of course will be smelly if you don't take care of it right away. I went to Prolago carwash & they did an awesome job my car looks like new.  Thank you guys love my clean car..</review>

<Response>None<//Response><text>(Translated by Google) I do not usually write this kind of stuff but today I went to this place because I was very full and I wanted to try it but it was quite expensive $ 42 dollars for outside washing and interior cleaning being that in any other place I pay 25 or 30 dlrs and I thought we're going to give it a try maybe it's another fart but it turns out not even a special treatment or even a complimentary bottle of water and aside from the moment the car is handed to you the person who does gives you the key with one hand and with the other asking for the tip and it turns out that at the time of paying they have a box on the side for the tips and I put money and when he gave me the key that happened and I told him that he had left a tip and the boy told me that It was very independent that they also wanted to tip. But finally, the first and last time I go to that place.

No suelo escribir este tipo de cosas pero hoy fuí a este lugar porque al que voy estaba muy lleno y pues quise probarlo pero se me hizo bastante caro $42 dólares por lavado exterior y limpieza interior siendo que en cualquier otro lugar pago 25 o 30 dlrs y pensé vamos a darle una oportunidad quizá sea otro pedo pero pues resulta que no ni un trato especial ni siquiera una botella de agua de cortesía y aparte al momento de que te entregan el carro la persona que lo hace te da la llave con una mano y con la otra pidiendo la propina y resulta que al momento de pagar ellos tienen una caja a un lado para los tips y les puse dinero y cuando me dio la llave pasó eso y le dije que adentro había dejado propina y me dijo el muchacho que eso era muy independiente que ellos también querían propina. Pero en fin primera y última vez que voy a ese lugar.</text>< rate>

This Hong Hong Express is really awesome! Talk about bang for your buck! Everything is made fresh and they’ve got all my favorite dishes. I’ve gotten party trays for many different events and they were a big hit!

I would definitely recommend coming here if you’re in the mood for Chinese food.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Best Chinese food in the nearby neighborhood. No need to try others. Yummy food with healthy amount of food. Service is fast and polite. No waiting in line currently because they work fast. Been there several times and they are consistently good. 👍<//Text>

I use to buy food from this place very often, but one day I stop by to get a combo and when I got home and start eating some pcs of the orange chicken was rotten and had a very bad smell. I got very angry and disappointed of this place. Since then have never buy from that place. They really dont care selling bad food.</text>

I been buying food from this place the last 3yrs. But this evening was dissappointed the food was cold. Orange chicken had a bone in it. When i called the lady said it could have been the powder. But i pull it out sure was a bone. And the BBQ pork was hard. This was my go to Chinese food. She did offer me a plate the next time i go. No thank you I will not be returning no more.<//text>

<Review>Only come if you want rice. Everything else has been sitting around and it's pretty hard and stuff. Go somewhere else unless you want rice, not sure about the chow mein but everything else sucks.</Review>< date>

The office will sell you product but when you drive across the street to pick it up surprise they dont have it. This has happened to me twice. The office refuses to make sure they have product before they sell it. Then they say we will order it after they have your money, with no firm delivery date because they refuse to check with their vendor about product availability. In both cases they did refund my money but it cost me hours of time for nothing. Dont trust them to tell you the truth, they just want to get your money.< /Review>

I am building a formal living room and a bakers kitchen, I ordered the lumber and dealt with Joshua he was real nice & said he would have the order pulled. All the lumber that was sold to me was the worst!!! It was very dry and the wood was chipped! I am very disappointed, especially because it is a family ran business! I would have ordered from  2 other companies that I had quotes from that I was referred to had I known this!!! Even if it cost just a little bit higher. I don't know who was responsible for the choice of the lumber that was pulled for my large order! I truly regret it! It was very hard to work with & the contractors did the best they could. I told the contractors they should have shown it to me & I would have returned it all!!!<//Review>

< review>
I needed to borate treated 4 x 4's they said they were special order those up or take a few days but I need to leave a deposit which is perfectly fine and understandable. They don't take deposits over the phone! no credit cards on hold or anything like that. I have to come downin person to put a deposit down.

Its a half hour drive away so this means another total hour of drive time just to give them a deposit. then I've got to drive back again a few days later to get the wood. I asked since I only need two pieces of wood with the order without a deposit. The answer is no. I mean God forbid I should change my mind and not pick up a couple of borate treated 4 x 4's. Like somehow they wouldn't be able to sell a couple of already treated 4 x 4's to somebody else. I guess I'm going to Ganahl lumber instead apparently guess they would prefer that.

I wasn't told anything like "well you could call back and talk to the boss and he might make an exception since your order is so small "no, I had to ask hey can I call back and talk to your boss and see if I make an exception. I mean I had to think of this, this idea let's make an exception to get a customer wasn't thought of on their end, so I don't have a lot of confidence in the way they run a business.
What kind of silly business wouldn't take a deposit over the phone? I guess this one apparently.< /review>

(Translated by Google) I bought wood for a first-class patio and it seemed that they picked it up from the garbage, it was badly damaged and beaten, the worst beaten and wet plawood, I would never recommend that terrible place

<Review>Everything was good, most staff was nice. The chubby guy at the ninja course was so rude to me and my son. He gave my son a pink helmet and said the red ones were for adults. They fit my sons head exactly the same! He insisted my son can only wear the pink helmet, when other kids the same size were wearing red helmets! He was rude and disrespectful and I can tell he hated being there! But why take it out on the customers kids!? Other than that my son had fun.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80945932f48d3c0b:0xad63a9876a191817< /gmapID></record>

Everything is brand new and cute but you are charged for each attraction in the facility as well as grip socks.

They charge you to enter in the trampoline/ball pit while the clovis location you dont have to pay you just have to have a wristband but this one even if you have a wristband they wont let u in and it was very irritating bc it was expensive already smh I Would not recommend this one but i do recommend no surrender in clovis ** i understand you have to have the card of points to enter but you have to purchase the card of points!!! The clovis location you dont!! You can enter as many times as you want!!! We didnt know that and my daughter was so sad we couldnt go in** response to the owner lol</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1614030694099, 'text': 'Hello Sarah -  The wristbands that were given to your party are used for checking-in and tracking and NOT used as pass for the attractions like at our Clovis location. PlayCards are provided with credits which are then redeemed at the attraction gate. To get into the attractions at the Fresno location you just need the PlayCard with credits which is issued with credits (40, 70, or 90 credits depending on which package you purchased) to each participant in your birthday party package.  Our attractions for birthday party packages have time limits,  2 Hour attraction time limit Fresno / 1 Hour attraction time limit Clovis. If credits on their card are depleted they may add more credits on the card by going up to our front desk cashier or at a kiosk.  We are glad you pointed this out and we will be addressing this with the team.  If you have any questions or concerns please reach out to our General Manager at (559) 551-4386.'}</Resp>< gmap_id>

Trampolines, ninja courses, arcade, small toddler area, and a buffet but it's not available due to the pandemic. BUT I won't be going back because on the day that I went, there was lots of adults that weren't wearing their mask properly and no one said anything. They do not wipe down and sanitize at all during my visit. I only saw one hand sanitizer dispenser. As much ppl and kids as there is, they need a sanitizer crew to carry wipes and bottles and constantly wipe down everything that ppl touch as possible. Especially the arcade area and the VR game which requires you to wear a device on your face. Ppl were going after another without cleaning it.

In all honesty this has to be one of the most superior arcades/ jump place in my opinion. Not only was the staff wonderful, the bathrooms were clean, it was covid safe, no wait list, big and open, amazing food, and the arcade and obstacles were clean and fun.Ike any other place it was pricey but worth the experience.<//Review>

Arrived a little late due to going to the wrong location, however; the staff was friendly and gave me extra time in my booked room. The only issue I have was receiving different information from different staff about having to pay or not having to pay for the trampoline area, and the adventure course area. It’s confusing to hear from one staff member that it’s free and then another that you have to pay 30 credits.< /Text>

Crossroads did an amazing job for me tonight. At the time of an absolute emergency, they went above and beyond for my pet. Their prices for an ER visit were higher than I expected, but all records were transferred on for me without even asking. I really feel like everyone cared and was doing everything they could tonight. Thank you all very much.< /review>

Many years ago i brought my cat here. The doctor was very nice and took his time examining her. Today was a completely different experience. Another vet saw her and pretty much sounded like her and her staff aren't good at handling older cats that are  stressed at the vet's office. She pretty much suggested other ER clinics and other vets. Said to examine her she would have to sedate her but seemed to be pushing me away to other places. Their confidence in their experience seems lacking. I've never had a vet encourage me to take my cat somewhere else. So weird. Don't come here if you have a true emergency and your pet is stressed. They don't know how to handle that. So for $100 consultation fee I was encourage to go somewhere else. Wish I had that money back to put it towards a vet that could handle examining a stressed kitty.</text>

< review>
I’ve brought my pup here 4 times (from swallowing foreign objects to kennel cough) and every single time the staff has been diligent and kind. I agree it can be rather expensive, but it’s an emergency room so you get what you pay for. Each and every time after they have evaluated my pup they have called me to give me options on what to do next - in my experience, they have never pressured me to choose the option that is more costly. In fact they have done the opposite, and have told me that certain procedures weren’t necessary which is why I believe they truly have your pet’s best interest at heart. They work odd hours and deal with many patients so the wait can be long, but I take comfort in the fact that if my puppy’s life was on the line they would take her in immediately and do everything in their power to save her (as I’ve seen them do in the past). Ultimately do what is right for you and your budget, but based on competency and care by the staff, I wholeheartedly recommend Crossroads.</review>

Friendly and helpful. Price is reasonable for an emergency clinic. People in here are just giving bad reviews because they complain about the price. Animal hospital meds and equipment are just as expensive as in human hospitals, people. STOP expecting Animal hospitals to be cheap or free, or don't you value your pet as much as a family member? If you go to a "cheap" place you should be concerned on what they actually do. And remember that this is an emergency hospital,  if it's for a check up I suggest you go to your pet's vet.<//text>

I'm so disappointed in this animal hospital the worst experience ever I took my dog because she was in labor and having complications and I was told to wait out in the parking lot for 8 hours or more and I was so  upset and sick to my stomach to watch my poor baby suffer and yet they still wanted to charge me a fee and they did nothing to her so I left and took her to a different vet. I don't recommend this place to no one at all this place needs to be shut down. We go to you for help and you guys give us no hope what so ever.< /review>

<Response>None</Response><text>To put my review in context, I must relate that in 2020 I dealt and am still dealing with doctors on an almost daily basis. Also, have been dealing with wonderful veterinarians at Washington Blvd Animal Hospital for 50 years. Thus, I have ample experiences to use as comparison with my 3/1-3/2/2021 interactions with Dr. Ortega. In 2020,  my daughter”s almost new car was stolen and then stolen from the first two thieves by another thief and was a total loss. Same.day daughter’s son, a lineman, fell from high steel electrical towers to be rescued by helicopter. Daughter then had open heart surgery and while she was in hospital, I had emergency surgery and spent ten days in hospital. Next daughter’s husband died on a Monday and on Saturday of same week daughter’s second open heart surgery left her in vegetative state. They fed fifty feral cats daily which friend and I are now doing. I am 73. Crossroads refused to let friend take very sick cat in for me and pay with my Care Credit card. My daughter is having a procedure today and I
needed to be rested. I offered to come sign for charges when visit complete. Nothing could be worked out and I had to sit in my car in the cold for four hours. Dr. Ortega never said one kind word with respect to my daughter’s condition (who has taken a cat there and spent a bundle.) Nor did she have an ounce of compassion for me. She wanted $900 to do blood and urine work and full body X-rays. I have never in 50 years had a veterinarian want to start out with both a blood panel and X-rays. A blood panel normally tells a lot about organs. I did the blood and urine tests and not the X-rays. Dr. Ortega told me the results but said without the X-rays she didn’t know the cause. I asked her to estimate the cat”s age which she said she couldn’t do. I know the rescued feral cat was at least 14 years olds and not having thousands to spend on X-rays, more tests, a blood transfusion and who knows what else, sobbing I made the decision to euthanize the sweet cat. I will never know what was really wrong with Butch because I would not trust one word out of Dr. Ortega’s mouth. I expect to pay a fair price for honest and compassionate veterinarian services. I would bet the equity in my house that Dr. Ortega’s number one motivation is MONEY! She appeared to be a cold, heartless individual who was incredibly rude and unreasonable. If money isn’t her primary motivation, she needs to learn some people skills. In all fairness, the staff was both kind and competent.</text></record>

They saved my boys life, and they were friendly. The vet was also empathetic towards my situation. Yes these emergency situations can be costly but if you love your pet it is worth every penny. Thanks crossroads for taking in my boy.</Review>

In a nutshell: any place that charges you $100 before even seeing/asking about your pet is NOT the type of care your pet deserves. Ashamed to have even thought of bringing my puppy here. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY, and ENERGY!<//Text>

<Text>Absolutely worst place you can take ur loved animal. All the staff are incredibly rude. While my dog was in critical condition all they cared about was the $100 up front. Gave me at least a 1 hour lecture and screamed at me and my grieving fiancé. No respect for the owners of the animal. Doctor Ortega said it’s “her job” to yell at us, but I thought her job was TO CARE FOR MY DOG! Was told they can not print out a receipt has to be through email. They never sent the email til I had to call and bug them.< /Text><Time>1615957708687</Time><name>Desirae Gutierrez< /name>< pics>

Do NOT take your pet here... I know some of us do things out of desperation because their hours are SO convenient but they’re just there to take advantage of your pets situation and charge you as much as possible. I took my cat around 8pm a few days ago, was told they’re were at capacity and wait times were 3-4hrs. We got there and the parking lot had no more than 3 cars. We ended up waiting the full 4hrs, they finally called me to bring him to the side past midnight and took him. They called after an hour or so to tell me they had to do xrays, blood work, full exam and I was looking at about $,1,250 but they would deduct the $95 I paid when I checked him in just so we could stay in line. I agreed to only find out later, xrays weren’t needed since the originali reason I took him in had nothing to do with the possibility if him having any broken bones or accident of any kind. They then called me around 4am to tell me treatment would cost me around $350. This would be fluids, antibiotics, probiotics and that’s it. I didn’t know any better and agreed. Total ended costing me almost $1,600 for NOTHING. They told me they would have his lab work in 3 days, never happened. I kept calling day 3, 4, 5 (always promising me a call back and results not being available) and today I told them I would not get off of the phone until I spoke with someone since NOW it’s been a full week since I took my cat there and he hasn’t ate anything since. I told them I’m not sure how he hasn’t passed away! They told me I should bring him in and hospitalize right away, I said no way, you guys already charged me $1,600 for what? No results. No diagnosis and want me to spend another $400 a night?!?! The guy told me I was looking at more like a minimum of $1,000 a night and that without treatment smh... I told them the only reason I took him there in the first place is because it’s damn near imposible for me to take him to a vet during the day because of my work hours and reason I had no choice but to take him to a hospital after hours. My kitty was bleeding from his rectum for a whole week before I decided to take him. I initially thought it was constipation because I read that’s very common and he’s an older cat but after he left that hospital, it was literally water/blood coming out if him for 3 days until he hasn’t gone anymore but then again he’s not eating, super sad, has tears in his eyes and can’t wait for Saturday to get here soon enough since his vet is open for a few hours during the day and my day off. Please pray for my cat guys, I’m trying to feed him pedialite, vitamins and he won’t let me give it to him in the baby syringe anymore. He also stopped drinking water and refuses to let us give him antibiotics anymore. By the way, around 11:30pm that night, a white Mercedes drove in crazy speeds, pulled in all the way past the gate meaning he worked there so I called again for an update to see where we were in line since we had been there since a little before 8pm. The nurse said doctor had just gotten back from lunch and things should start moving along faster. The truth is that doctor wasn’t there and didn’t arrive till almost midnight when they’re suppose to be open at 6pm and told me and others I’m sure they were at max capacity and reason waiting hours were 3-4hrs smh. They are liars and crooks taking advantage of peoples situations and their pets since they know for many, pets are family and many cases like peoples babies/kids.< /review>

Horrible. I took my sick cat in yesterday at The Crossroads. I called them in tears because I thought he wasn't going to make it.
I paid $95.00 for them to babysit him and stick a thermometer in my cat.
They call you from the parking lot as you wait for them to do the "physical" exam. 30min go by and they call you also depending on the many dogs and cats they see that night..
In order for my cat to "feel better" (their words exactly) it would be $2,000+ dollars for their services of x rays, blood work, medicine, ect. If you can't afford it, they will offer you a payment plan to pay for the  outstanding bill. If you tell them no thanks I'll take him to a more affordable hospital; They will get passive aggressive towards you.
They will have you sign dispatch papers  stating negative false statements on possible cruelty and abusive behavior to my animal and his surroundings for declining treatment offered from them. I refused to sign because I felt as my honest human right I don't have to sign and agree with any of their nagative statements accusations towards me and my pet. I know how I am with my pet and that's final.
They re-wrote the documents and have you SIGN. In order to receive your fur baby back you will need to SIGN guys, pay attention, AND if you call the sheriff's station  they can't do anything for you.
The parking lot is another story.. as you're waiting in their parking lot you see other random cars of who knows also waiting to be called as well. The lights will turn off for a couple minutes and it can be a little freaky like something feels a little off.
I don't know but I wouldn't want anyone to go through this experience that I went through last night. When your fur baby is in someone else's hands and you cant save him. Not good so I felt I needed to write this.<//Review>

I should’ve listened to the other reviews. If your pet doesn’t 100% require immediate attention at an odd hour of the day, go elsewhere. I came here because I was worried about my dog and was charged $95 for a consultation, $300 for bloodwork, and $300 for x-rays only to be told that they can’t tell me exactly what’s wrong with my dog. I was told we should just move forward with surgery for another $3500. And if you leave to think about it, you have to pay the $95 fee again. I went somewhere else with a free consultation fee and much more reasonable prices.< /Review>

Horrible! I am so disappointed in their services.  They charge you $95 before yourndog is admitted in the facility. You wait and theybtell you that you neednto do the whole works, xray, blood work and anything to help their bill increase. We said no, and then she said let me call you back. Called us back to negotiate a different solution. Half the cost. Now it wasnt about the money but the way they go about business.

Went to local vet next day, under 300 conpared to thousands. BEWARE!<//review>

<text>If I could give this place a minus 0 I would!!! During A time of this pandemic,  we,  animal parents, are face to see anyone who could help us bring health to our beloved furry family members when they are sick. First let me say that the staff itself is polite and pleasant when you call to make appointment and when you speak to the technician over anything but the less classy vet Claire Ortega leaves a lot to say about her professionalism! When you are faced with the fact that you brought your dog in for something that you “hoped”could be treated and this doctor tells you she is going to die if she doesn’t get the treatment vet is advising... it you take your pet home. When you question if there are options??? This woman is really something. All I could say is To never never never take your pet here. It is true! They ask for a credit card before they see your pet! And they charge you the $95 whooping fee! This place is not about your baby! ti’s about this placing making money! I wish I would have read reviews but I was referred by another vet that were full. Unfortunately my dog is really sick and it seemed she came out worse than what she went in.

Don’t want to make this supper long but please don’t go to this place and if you think I am lying... research Clair Ortega and you will see who this monster of a vet is. This whole COVID has made things hard but this person Clair Ortega makes things a whole lot worse! Stay away. You have been worn!< /text><rate>1< /rate></record></dataset><record>

took my puppy there(emergency) after a 3,000.00 vet bill from crossroads (my vet was closed) then took her to our regular vet who sent her to specialist and another 6,000.00 dollar surgery because Crossroads did not fix her leg properly in the first place it led to bigger problems. I do not recommend ! 000000stars  .<//Text>

I never write reviews but felt compelled to after the service I received here. I took my fur baby Luna here after she had an allergic reaction and her eyes/lips were very swollen. Because of covid-19, I was not allowed inside which was completely understandable. Over the phone, I gave them a brief description & paid the $95 exam fee. The vet tech met me at a side door and I handed my dog over. I was beyond nervous so I’m so grateful that I received two calls from them within 30 minutes updating me and letting me know how she was doing and what the doctor recommended (fluids, blood work, steroid injection, benadryl injection, eye flush, Benadryl tablets to take home, & an antihistamine).  I agreed to everything and was told the price would be $355. So my final total for the exam fee and treatment was $450. I was beyond relieved to hear this price as I was picturing something much higher. Once they were done the doctors assistant came out and gave me some discharge instructions, along with the medication and some complimentary Just for Dogs dog food (which my dog loved and I will most likely be switching her to)...

I was such an emotional wreck as she’s never been sick before but every single person I spoke to (the receptionist, vet tech & doctors assistant) was so kind and seemed genuinely happy to help. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. If anyone at Crossroads is reading this, I’m beyond thankful. Sending so much love to every single one of you who helped my Luna today.<//text>

<Text>This place only wants to make money out of your pet.   They are trained like car salesman.   They seem to get a commission from the charges.  That night, there were only two dogs that they were treating, with a staff of 5 people, they would lose money that night therefore they treated my dog like it’s money making time.    They recommend this cost and that cost like a appliance salesman getting a commission.      Of course I was desperate and agreed to all.   They seemed to be pleased that they are making the sales.  They over treated my dog , shocked her and she died.  Absolutely over treated her, sent her into shock.   May be the treatment was needed but it’s their salesman ship that made me sick to the stomach.  Even upon her death, they wanted to sell me casket or cremation for more money.   This place may look clean but under the cover are commissioned sales person.   It just seems they care more about their income or their commission.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2d2b24ef27af3:0x29927b7ee3e5612a< /gmap_id></record>

This is the second time I've had to take my kenai to this hospital, and both times they been amazing to my baby, I wish I could explain how grateful I am with everyone there, they all knew Kenai very well, called me to check up on her, I can honestly say that everyone from the receptionist, to billing, to nurses, and specially Dr. Camuso, were exceptional!!! Again Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!<//Review>

If I could give 0 stars I would. This place is so terrible. They required a 700 fee before even checking my puppy of 5 months. They knew I was so worried because she was having seizures and told me they were doing tests and I refused to hospitalize her over night because they wanted to charge me 2,000 so they asked me how much more money I was willing to spend. I said no more than 500 apart from the 700 because obviously I wanted my puppy to be good and wanted to know what was going on. I ended up spending 1,200 for them to just tell me NOTHING. They were not helpful at all. They didn’t know what to even tell me they just wanted more money. I went to my local vet few days after and showed them the paperwork of what they did and even my puppy’s vet said that was RIDICULOUS. They refused to give her any meds that would help the seizures but luckily my puppy’s vet gave her an injection that they should’ve gave her at this place. I only took her here because my local vet was closed. This place is horrible and robs your money. Plain and simple!</Review>

REFUSE SERVICES IF YOU SEE WENDY BUCKLE. This is by far the worst animal emergency hospital we have gone to. We had the unfortunate idea to come here since it was closer to us and our dog was vomiting clear liquid. THE VET (WENDY BUCKLE) PLAYS WITH YOUR EMOTIONS, do not fall for this. She'll tell you "you came in a right time" and makes the situation of your dog worse than it is and overcharges you. Not only did we decline the 2,000+ charge we notified them if he can at least get the injection for his infection which she refused to do so. After we stated we wanted our dog back she kept insisting that we wanted our dog to die and there's 95% chance our dog will die in the morning. She also told us she was going to call animal control and that they were going to knock on our door and fine us for animal negligence. YES SHE TOLD US THIS JUST BECAUSE WE REFUSED THE SERVICES AND WANTED TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR HIS TREATMENT. We went to another animal hospital that night and thank god we asked for the $500 copies of his results as well as his x-rays at Crossroads Animal Hospital. The other doctor reviewed his results and told us he isn't in critical condition and welcomed my pup in the morning (No, our dog was nowhere near death like she said he was). IF YOU SEE WENDY BUCKLE YOU SHOULD RUN.< /review>

<review>I had an excellent experience with this pet hospital. My dog, a four pound chi, swallowed a small bone fragment that lodged in his throat. He was unable to swallow it or to cough it up.I thought he was going to die. He was having trouble breathing.  The doctor at the facility had never performed a surgery  removing a bone, on this particular area, but he said he would try to save my dog's life. Usually the bone will travel into the stomach and cannot go through the bowel or intestine. Anyway, the doctor was able to surgically remove the bone, (at time of surgery it was just above the heart).  It was quite risky. But the doctor took such great care and the surgery was successful. I love my dog and will never allow him to have any type of bone again.  Thanks to the doctor, I am given more time to love and care for my dog.I cannot say enough, except I did put my dog's life in the doctor's hands and it was the best thing to do. So you can take my word that this is a good place to entrust your pet to.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>DO NOT BRING YOUR PETS HERE IF YOU CAN HELP IT.

This was an AWFUL experience.
I brought my 2 year old dachshund in here due to a urinary blockage. Xilo was in desperate need of help.

FIRST RED FLAG: They take your pet away from you right away. My little guy was obviously in a lot of pain, and he is often nervous and fearful around new people. I don't understand why we aren't allowed to see our pet after he gets checked in.

SECOND RED FLAG: The woman who came out to take him didn't have a chart, didn't even have a piece of paper! SHE WAS WRITING THE INFO WE GAVE HER ON HER GLOVE.
I should have walked out then, but I was too worried about my Xilo.

THIRD RED FLAG: My dog was THE ONLY ANIMAL GETTING CHECKED IN. The workers REPEATEDLY asked me his name. OVER & OVER & OVER. I was obviously very emotional & upset. Maybe it's asking a lot, but they could have at least PRETENDED to care about my baby by peeking at his paperwork. But then again, maybe they threw away that info glove right???

FOURTH RED FLAG: When they finally call us to the back we're escorted to this weird empty room, with 2 chairs, but my dog is still no where to be seen. Dr. Buckle walks in and tells us in the most insincere tone how "they'll take care of our baby" then an assistant walks in to explain the coming bill.

FIFTH (It Keeps Going!): Said assistant walks in, and begins talking to us in a hushed dramatic tone, like he's pretty much whispering at us how the Dr. needs $670 worth of tests JUST to diagnose my dog. He tries to convince us we need ALL of those tests to make sure we know what's going on. We could not afford to pay that much and still get him treated. All of a sudden he goes to talk to the Dr. about how they could bring down the price. This goes on 3-4 times.

Are we in a negotiation??? WE ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE CLEARLY ONLY TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE'RE WILLING TO SPEND.

SIXTH RED FLAG: When we tell whisper guy WE CAN NOT afford even the lowest option ($355) he sends in the vet. We tell her we'd rather check Xilo out and try to get a second opinion. We want to save him, not spend our already small budget on one X-ray. THATS WHEN THE EXTREME SHAMING, AND SCARE TACTICS BEGIN.

She tells us that if we take Xilo "without treatment" she will have to report us to animal control under California law. Because We were "informed he could be suffering".
Then she goes on and on explaining how his bladder could rupture if it was a kidney stone causing the blockage and he needs to be diagnosed.
Ummm OKAY. Who's the worse person? Me, because I can't afford your price gouging, or YOU Dr. Buckle, who have access to everything needed to diagnose/save him, but refuse because I can't pay you up front!!!

Then she tried to convince me I should put my dog down if we couldnt afford to diagnose him. Just like that. From 1 hour to the next I was supposed to give up on his life and kill him. Without even knowing what was going on.

They were 100% preying on our fear, worry, and love for our pet. It was clearly a mind game from the very start.
We told her she could do what she wanted and call whoever she needed to call. We were taking him out of that place.

We left there with a $130 bill for the exam and one pain injection. We have no way of knowing that he even actually GOT the shot, and we weren't consulted about it either. Apparently another "CA law".

Obviously we didn't mind paying for that, he definitely needed it, I just wish I had actually SEEN it happen. But the exam was a total waste of money. They told me nothing of value.

This Place couldn't even be bothered to take ACCURATE NOTES from his visit. Attached in images you'll find the paperwork we received. 9/10/18??????
& XILO DIDN'T RECIEVE ANY MEDICATION???
Again, at least PRETEND to care.

My Xilo made it through the night, and was seen by the wonderful people at Bellflower Pet Hospital who worked with us instead of focusing on money. He had emergency surgery with them the next day.

I understand an ER is an ER. But if I were you, I'd try a different one for your pet.<//text><Rating>1< /Rating><Time>1523698565811</Time><gmapID>0x80c2d2b24ef27af3:0x29927b7ee3e5612a<//gmapID></record>

We are so grateful to have chosen Crossroads.  The staff was extremely friendly!  The doctor made us feel at ease and took his time with us to explain his diagnosis and the treatment he would be giving our pit bull Ivy.  We felt comfortable and had no doubt that Ivy would receive the best possible care.  Their staff cares and it shows! We would definitely come back and would recommend Crossroads to anyone.  Thank you for the excellent care and service you provided Ivy and us.</Text>

<Text>Was unhappy and felt they were  dishonestt when evaluating my dog. The counselor said they needed multiple tests before even treating my dog and the cost would be 1140.oo ( before treating him).  I felt that they are taking advantage of people at there low point worried about there loving pets.</Text>< time>

<Review>I had a wonderful experience at Crossroads.  I was scrambling at the last second to find a good emergency vet for my dog that was suffering from bloat.  I needed to find the most cost effective pet hospital and I think Crossroads was the best.  They were honest about all possible outcomes for my pet and how that translated into dollars.  They were very friendly, very knowledgeable and had great communication.  I think I made the best choice for my pet and would not hesitate to refer Crossroads to anyone.  It was worth the drive.  Thank you Crossroads!!!!!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I've never done a review before - but I had to this time. I was so disappointed.  This was the closest ER i could take my dog who had a sudden allergic reaction - it was bad his eyes were swollen and his muzzle and he was covered in hives. They took my dog in immediately and soon after a vet came in and said what i already knew - he had an allergic reaction - he had had hives before but  nothing this severe involving a swollen face. She told me I did the right thing by bringing him in because his throat was starting to close. Typically, in the past, they would give him one shot of benadryl & another of a steroid. ( At other ER'S )I've walked out the door with about $200-250 tab including the visit fee. Not only did this vet make me panic that my dogs airways were closing but they came in with these quotations for two shots along with blood work and blah blah. Telling me I had to pay $707 dollars to help him! I didn't have this money - it put me in to a complete panic. I didn't understand if that flat fee was $75 - how could this be an additional 600+ dollars. After a few minutes of crying and panic - a nurse came in with a reduction of a little over $400 and a payment plan ( which was nice ) but, still way over my budget - and they made it sound like they were removing some of the treatments to lower the price and if anything happened to my dog it was my fault for not agreeing to the $700. Meanwhile, my dog is still struggling. I agreed to the plan to pay over $400 with a payment plan.

The next morning his eyes were still swollen shut and hives were coming back. I took him to a primary care vet. THIS is where it gets bad. They gave him the same two shots plus an additional long lasting allergy shot... i walked out with a bill of $105 including the visitation. I showed them the  bill and told him what I was quoted at the ER - no one could believe it. Ripped off completely. I don't recommend this place. Definitely not as compassionate towards the pets / owners as other places I've been to.

Please don't take advantage of people - Our pets mean so much.<//Review>

I am forever grateful for Crossroads ER. They have helped me with three different pet emergencies and this 3rd one saved my pets life. He is a diabetic and his blood sugar dropped to 31. There quick response and 24 hour care overnight...He has been insulin free for 3 weeks and holding. The doctors and staff truly love animals and I highly recommend them.<//text>

I was so pleased how my pet was taken care of. they took gentle care of her and really took time out to explain her procedure and care after surgery. we even had a follow up call to see how our girl was doing and were told if we had any other questions to feel free to call. I would definitely go back if my pets needed attention<//Review>

My little terrier was attacked in our backyard by a coyote at 2 in the morning. I rushed her to Crossroads where staff acted immediately to diagnose her injuries and calm my nerves. They were frank but gentle with their assessment and prognosis and clearly explained their plan of treatment. They were businesslike and understanding as to costs and financing. Their quick actions and expertise saved my dog’s life. When they discharged my pup to the care of our regular vet, they had already called my vet to explain the injuries and treatment and transmitted all her records. They made sure I had a copy of the records as well as a DVD with all xrays and scans. I feel very fortunate to have such talented and caring professionals so close by. Thank you Crossroads for saving my pup’s life.</review>

Was very disappointed my dog has allergies she was bitting so bad she was bleeding tried to get her in my vet, was a holiday weekend so took her to emergency no one at all there, I was told the doctors were going into surgery so I was told to go to another clinic or come back later, which is fine but then another dog came in and they seen him right away, I understand allergies is not a big deal but I guess I wasn’t paying a arm and leg for there services, I feel I my dog was treated very unfair not a good way to run a business   Shame on you< /review>

It was a Saturday on a holiday weekend and my Vet would not be open until that Monday. My dog went in to Crossroads Animal Emergency with flu symptoms. A cough that was causing difficulty breathing. Instead of starting off with the simplest and least expensive of conducting a blood test for her. They scared me by saying something could be wrong with her heart and lungs. They came at me with a cost of 800 for all the test. I was alone, they knew I was worried about my dog and fed off my fear to make as much money off of me. I told them I couldn’t afford that so they took out one unnecessary test at gave me a revised cost of 600. I asked if they can just do a blood test because I am positive she has flu symptoms or a common cold. I want her cough taken care of. They told me something can be wrong with her heart and I should have all these tests done because something could happen over the long weekend. Frustrated, tired and worried I ended up having to pay 580 and when the tests came back, my dog had a bacterial infection so antibiotics were prescribed. That’s it, her heart and lungs were fine. Which I had already told them, she had no history of problems. They are a rip off and out to take as much money from their patients. They know, if we take our pets to an emergency at odd hours then we will be willing to pay anything. I feel like they robbed me and took my kindness and love for my dog for granted. Horrible! Horrible! Avoid going to this business!</text>

<username>Rhonda B< /username><Date>1559275152666< /Date><Rating>5<//Rating><text>I took my cat Millie in to see our regular vet to treat a large abscess on her side. She had surgery with a huge incision closed with sutures. Unfortunately, the vet didn't leave a drain for any recurring infection to come out on it's own. Millie developed an abscess with pus coming out around the sutures. We took her to Crossroads, and Dr Thomas Camuso opened the wound and cleaned it out, and left a drain at the site.  It was a bad infection and the incision was in the worst spot. Every time Millie moved her leg forward, it put pressure on the stitches. We had to take her back in to get the wound debrided. Dr Thomas fixed it up and put staples.  We took Millie back to get the staples removed and all seemed well, but due to the location of the original incision, the wound opened back up.  Back we go to see Dr Thomas! This time he closed the wound with dissolving sutures and that did the trick. I'm so thankful for his persistance, knowledge, and skill.  It has been several months, and Millie is doing great.  Dr Thomas saved her life and for that, we  are so grateful. Thank you so much.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Great service! My cat was recently diagnosed with diabetes and her blood sugar dropped pretty low; I gave her honey and took her in to be checked out. The staff was very helpful, and the doctor and assistant did a great job at explaining the process of what would be done. When everything was done, they both went over the results and recommended to reduce the cat's insulin dosage and to follow up with the primary vet in a few weeks. In the end, the price wasn't as high as I thought it would be; I paid around $250 for the examination, blood work, fluids (the electrolytes were a little low, so fluids were given to raise electrolytes levels) and appetite stimulant medication (the cat wasn't eating well). It is a little expensive for what was done, but it was a medical emergency and the cat's primary vet was closed, but like I mentioned earlier, great service and great staff. One last thing, they do have coffee, teas and snacks in the lobby.

Update: The vet is caring because the following evening, they called to check up on my cat to see how she was doing and answered a few of my questions. They even called my cat's primary vet to give them an update on the emergency visit because the primary vet called me (and told me that Crossroads had called him) the following day to get an update on my cat as well. Great communication!< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I brought my dog in for severe allergies and within minutes she was evaluated,  Dr. Camuso sat with me to discuss her course of treatment and the staff couldn't have been more efficient, kind and understanding. It was a pleasure working with them and I would absolutely recommend my family and friends to take their pets if an unexpected emergency should happen.</text>

I was so grateful that Crossroads was open on Thanksgiving night. I brought my 3 year old choco lab in because his tail was bleeding like crazy from excitement. The staff was kind, understanding, and so helpful considering my pup is large and he was spewing blood left and right. The care of both my pup and me was excellent. I wish they weren't as expensive as they are but I'm forever grateful for their great care and customer service.</Text>

<Text>Crossroads helped us when we didn't know where to go, or what was wrong with our dog. They have wonderful staff, a clean, comfortable facility, and they know what they're doing. Our 12 year old Golden had shoulder pain and couldn't lift his head or stand; we thought it was the end. Crossroads staff diagnosed the issue, and set us up to help our boy recover. He's now doing great, and we're looking forward to more years of fun and love with him.

Thank you for saving our boy and helping us through a hard time!<//Text><userid>107579275619586116903<//userid><Gmap_id>0x80c2d2b24ef27af3:0x29927b7ee3e5612a</Gmap_id><date>1485634004217<//date><username>Jennifer Jenkins</username>< response>

What is an Emergency? What is your time worth? Go here only if it’s dire. I bet they could of saved my dog. But I didn’t go there after they overcharged me the first time I was there for my cat. It wasn’t even worth it though. Air and a bandaid 300$ But really if you need like an emergency surgery they can probably do it.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>On a late Sunday afternoon my Maltese, Dolly became very sick and basically could not even stand up.  I called our regular Vet and of course they were closed on Sunday.  They referred me to Crossroads Animal Hospital.  I called them, rushed Dolly there and boy was I suprised and pleased.  The facility was clean and beautiful.  The staff was exceptional and they took immediate action with Dolly.  I picked her up the next morning and she was much better.  I would recommend Crossroads to everyone.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>This place is such a ripoff. How can you charge someone money before your dog gets any treatment done?? How ridiculous can this place be. They couldn't find out what was wrong with my dog and yet kept suggesting other things to be done and nothing even worked after all. They take your money I really don't recommend this place. Bad bad experience.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>If I could leave NO STAR as a option, I would. They dont even deserve one star for their shoddy diagnosis. I never leave reviews but for this place I just had to let others know so that they will not be taken advantaged of.

My husband took our bulldog there because of breathing problems. They then looked at his mouth and proceeded to tell us that my dog has a tumor without a biopsy or a sample. They immediately wanted us to go for tumor removal at $2700. We asked to see the tumor and of course they claim that it would not be a good idea for my husband to see it because “the dog might get excited.” They did not want show it to us. We knew something was wrong there. Finally, They took a picture of a mass in my dog’s mouth and said they have to remove it before they can check the tumor. Really????? Surgery before a biopsy? They examined him and His vitals were all positive—an indication that he is not suffering from a deadly tumor that they claim “we should act on as soon as possible.”

We took our dog out of that place and immediately got a second opinion at ANIMAL CARE CLINIC in bellflower.
Guess what? No tumor, just bad teeth was the culprit. My dog has an appointment for dental surgery at a fraction of the cost of the supposed tumor surgery! Dr sal at animal care clinic showed us his mouth and could not find a tumor! We showed the new clinic the diagnosis from crossroads and they could not find this TUMOR after several examinations. My husband was in the examination room with our dog. Animal care clinic was totally transparent and made sure we are a part of the process unlike crossroads who separated us from our dog.

I would never recommend anyone to take their beloved pets at crossroads. They should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of pet owners at their time of need. They really work on the pet owner’s fear of losing their pet.

Go to ANIMAL CARE CLINIC in bellflower. They are great and professional! Hope this post helps others out there with their vet decision.</Review>< GmapID>

Always hate the bills, but always grateful they are there. Because when does an emergency ever happen when your regular vet  is in? Crossroads is more expensive, but so is an Urgent Care or ER visit for a human. The doctors are caring and compassionate, and the care is great.<//Review>

Summation: Shysters of the first degree. Crossroads Animal Emergency feeds on the emotions of animal lovers and instills fear from a position of authority with the ultimate goal of squeezing money out of you. Crossroads is the most disgusting establishment I have ever experienced. Completely devoid of ethics, honesty, and full of nothing but greed. Truly, they should be out of business. Anyone else who has experienced this awful place PLEASE file a complaint with the California Veterinary Medical Board (google it, you can file a complaint online). Also note the positive reviews appear fake and have few other reviews to their username. Read all of the horror stories the negative reviews detail here; based on my experience they are no exaggeration. Just thinking about this place gets me worked up and reminds me how low some people can stoop for a buck.

Full review of my experience:

I regrettably visited this emergency vet when my 5 month old kitten got a cut and needed stitches late at night. My kitten seemed fine and in good spirits, no blood was coming out, but I was obviously concerned since her skin was open with a ~2 inch cut. The first warning sign with Crossroads was when I called to get an opinion on the risks of waiting until the morning (6hr wait) or if I should take her in immediately. They made me fearful, "we really can't say anything unless you take her in", without asking any questions or listening to me. Fair enough, I'll take her in. I love my cat to death and I want her to live a long life. No need to risk her life for some sleep.

I take her in. Before I even sit down or sign my name they take my cat into the back. No place I've been to has taken my cat away like that. Not only that, she's taken to the back and the room my friend and I are taken to isn't the same room as my kitten. I'm getting a very strange vibe. This is more notable considering the experience at the hospital I eventually took her to where I carried my cat into the exam room, took her out of the carrier myself, showed the cut on her stomach myself, and stayed with her the whole time until I left her with the vet.

Back to Crossroads: Within 10 minutes of being there they have 3 different people talk to me and they all talk with hushed inflection as if it's a dire situation. Their play on fear did work on me.They tell me it will be $1500-1700 for the surgery to give her stitches. I was stunned, but as my mind was racing I reasoned that if that's what it cost, then fine. They're the authority, I don't know anything about animals or injuries. I should trust them to not gouge me in this difficult situation, who would do that when we all just want to care for our pets? Well, this place gladly gouges people. Luckily my close friend was there and convinced me to tell them that I can't do it because I don't have the money, because I really don't.  My friend also picked up on the bizarre vibe of the workers there too.

We told them we can't afford it, so what are the risks of taking her home and waiting, and how can we make sure my kitten is okay for the next 5-6 hours? They offer ZERO advice or recommendations, they go straight into describing severe infection, skin peeling back and rotten to the point of being unable to be sutured, as if that is what my kitten faces if we don't pay up. Fear. Nothing but fear and lies is what they gave us. We said we wanted to take my cat and go. The creep leaves the room and comes back a few minutes later, like a timeshare salesmen and shows us a paper with a reduced price. $1200. What is this insanity? This isn't a negotiation, I don't want to do business with you, give me my cat so I can go. And why wouldn't you offer the lower price in the first place if you could do it for that much?

They hold my cat hostage in the back until I pay $75 just for the visit. More greed. I kept an eye on my kitten until morning. She got the surgery elsewhere that day, I picked her up & paid $510 and she recovered in a few days to perfect health.

Please don't submit yourself to this horrible place. Find anywhere else.< /review>

<review>Don't go here if you don't have to.  Find another hospital.  I had to wait for months before I could write a review because I'm STILL upset with what happened.  Within minutes of the staff taking my pet in the back, she collapsed and could not breath.  I don't know what they did back there.  While all of this was happening the doctor was in the room with me asking the exact same questions the tech asked me before they took my pet.  In the meanwhile she is left with whoever was in the back not knowing what to do.  The doctor should have been there with the sick pet!  They actually ran in the room urgently telling the doctor he was needed.  She died that night.  It was a horrible experience.  I had questions two days later for the doctor.  Left a couple messages but he never called me back.   TERRIBLE!</review>< Time>

Went in on Sunday morning at 2am .  My pregnant dog could not push out her pups.  The receptionist was very rude and criticised me for not having my dog fixed
The doctors assistant was very rushed in explaining my payment options.  The only staff member that was an over all dear and sincere in helping my situation was the female doctor that examined my dog.
I do not ever plan to visit that facility again, if I can help it.  One star from me.  Poor people management skills.</text>

<review>On 7/9/12 the day after we got home from vacation my boys were out taking our dogs for a walk. The leash to one of our dogs (Nate) broke and he ran into the street where he was hit and killed. The staff here took excellent care of him and made sure we as a family were as comfortable as possible with the process and helped us grieve. We even received a condolences card front the nurse who helped us. The staff are truly amazing and care very much about the pets and their families.

<Review>This is a money hungry business, NOT an animal care center. Find another, emergency or 24 hr veterinary. They will compliment you and your animal as a coax to lure you into believing they have your best interest at heart. THEY DON'T!! They come back and forth into the exam room with different evaluations contradicting their diagnosis when you question them. They literally tried to convince me into having every test, scan, treatment they offered while offering no insight to what could be wrong with my dog. After I rejected all their EXPENSIVE (very over priced) tests, I asked for a fever reducer and possibly an antibiotic to start my dog, they very angrily refused and said she really doesn't have a high fever, while at the beginning of the visit they pleaded with me to get her started on an IV, catheter, rush blood tests because her "fever" was so high and she was in distress that required Immediate attention???? Please don't let yourself or your animal go through this manipulation in your time of need. They prey on the emotions and vulnerability of animal lovers. (They also inserted a catheter without my consent, while the receptionist assured me nothing would be done to my dog before consulting me)

This is the worst place to go for emergencies. All they care about is money. My poor puppy was having seizures and they did absolutely nothing because I could not afford to pay $500 just for tests not the treatment. They sent me and my puppy home but not without charging me for them doing nothing what so ever. They did not even offer advice on what to do if the seizures continue. I do not recommend. They didn't try to help at all. You really have to be evil if you can send away a sick 3 month old puppy. Hope this place goes out of business.< /review>

<Text>At the time that I went, the staff was actually kind and friendly.
My cat developed a bump behind one of her legs. It was very painful for her to move around, so I immediately called and was told to bring her in right away. It ended up being an abscess (most likely from a cat fight). I think I was overcharged and could have found a better deal somewhere else, but my cat was in pain and I didn't want to make my poor girl suffer any longer. It was busy that night and I remember waiting a long time, but they performed a clean service and gave me instructions for medication. My cat was immediately better.
I get paranoid about the competency of vets and their techs these days, so I appreciate that I had a good visit there. I would just recommend having multiple vet clinics on your phone in case of an unforeseen event. You might get a better deal.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><gmapID>0x80c2d2b24ef27af3:0x29927b7ee3e5612a</gmapID><userid>114522073692920957478</userid>< time>

I had a horrible experience at this hospital. My dog was bleeding from her nose the doctor told me they had to operate her from her nose because there was a little ball inside her nose. After the operation she got worst she didn't want to eat or drink water. She was weaker everyday and she also got an infection from this hospital
and now she is dead. This hospital killed my dog. I don't recommend anyone to go to this hospital. They just want your money and they don't care about the animals.<//Review>

Our dog got hit by car while we were visiting family in Downey. It was the worse feeling ever and we came to crossroads to get her taken care of.

<Resp>None< /Resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Date>1502160546692</Date><review>Me and my wife brought our dog here after she was ran over, I turned my dog to them and she was breathing normally. Supposedly she started panicking like crazy and that they had administer oxygen for 85$, and the office visit was 75$ (which is expensive when I have gone to clinics in the past for less than half that.) They administered something for the pain thankfully, but they have not done anything apart from that, they said they need to run diagnostics first which will be about 2 grand, each x ray is 225$ and they wanted six x rays, plus they wanted to run some blood work. Well I am wondering when are they going to treat her and at what cost? I request for them to cast the legs that where damaged so I can take her to a doctor in Tijuana because I live in San Diego. We wanted them clean her wounds too but they said they cant because they have to put her to sleep first. The doctor then came and said she is in critical condition and that she can die at any moment, that might not make being transferred to another vet. I took the risk and took her anyways because our bill was going to come out to 5,000 if she stayed the night at that hospital. In the end we paid 448$ for a cast on uncleaned, untreated legs, oxygen, pain medication, and the pain reliever they gave her while she was with them about an hour and a half. I took her to my doctor, as soon as I brought her in he started treating he. He immediately started cleaning the wounds, cutting the skin that was hanging off her legs. He told me luckily only her legs where damaged by the accident, that nothing was broken and their is no internal bleeding. He said she will recover in 2-4 months. I was so relieved because the doctors here at this hospital told me she was going to die, she would not be able walk anymore, and would not treat her until "diagnostics" were done. They tried to manipulate our fear to pay them thousands of dollars. My doctor even said that they could have easily cleaned her wounds at least to avoid infection. So....... if you are fortunate enough to have extra cash, do not come her, they will play on your fear and run every test and administer anything possible to charge you the most. (By the way my doctor only charged me 88$ for the full treatment AND the medications with extra bandages. If your pet needs expensive surgery, or something alike, its worth the drive, even flight. The doctors in Mexico genuinely care for the animals and they know what they are doing.) In the end I am happy she on her way to a full recovery :)< /review></record>

<review>DO NOT TAKE YOUR ANIMAL HERE. ....what a joke!!!!! My dog got bit and doc saying they need to prep him for surgery and will be there for a couple days. ...I told him no way. ..he hot bit but wasn't gushing blood...was acting normal and walking around. ...then doc says well let's do a diagnostic text. ...his assistant came in room and I saw  $895 JUST for diagnostic test. ...asked for my dog back ...declined services only to pay $130
Immediately went to VCA. .... said no deep bites.... no staples needed. ..gave meds and walked out at $232.
THIS PLACE IS ONLY ABOUT MONEY! !!!!

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>I took my cat to this office today (this morning) when she was lethargic and not able to stand.  I had her tested for the cat AIDS virus and I was told that it was negative, but this doctor tested her and said it came back positive for the virus, but that she contracted it from another cat who possibly came into my yard.  The initial fee to do blood work was 155.00, then they came back and told me that xrays would be an additional 401.00 dollars!  I paid it, because I wanted to save my cat.  Well, I'm still not sure if I was taken to the cleaners, but the doctor showed me her
x-rays and said that her kidneys were failing and that she had a mass in her chest.  I could barely see it, but I was very emotional and my cat couldn't stand up at all and was very weak, so she was definitely sick, but I could stand seeing her in any pain.  I guess I should've taken her to another vet, but I didn't know what to do, but I decided to take her out of her pain and they charged me another 375.00 to put her to sleep and to cremate her and deliver her ashes along with a paw print and her name on a redwood pine box to me in about 3 weeks.  After reading these reviews, I wish I had waited and taken her somewhere else, but at least she is not in pain anymore, but I feel very guilty for not taking her for a 2nd opinion.  I roughly spend around 1,000 dollars and feel horrible after the fact now that I see the bad reviews.

it's a horror, they only care about money and they do not care about the poor animals, they are still dying, they do not care, they have to pay for attention, where the love and professionalism of the animals remains! of course they had to pay but annoying that they first want to see that you have to pay then they charged $ 450 and they said take him home and if he survives they take him to a clinic tomorrow<//Review>

<Text>RIDICULOUS!!!! Terrible experience... do not come here. They do not care about your animal... they care about whats in your wallet. They are not passionate about helping the pets. They are more interested in what they can get from your creditor. But i give credit to one person (Beth) she was great.... overall, this place is a nest of vultures... wallet scourging freaks!!!!<//Text><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>These people are in no way animal lovers. They prey on the emotions of loving pet owners to squeeze you for as much money as they can. Took my aunt's dog in last night. He's a small breed who was bitten by a Rottweiler. The laceration to his abdomen was large but not life threatening. Doctor comes and paints a horrific picture that dog is in shock, and they need to stabilize him before surgery. This was after already having us pay $750, which only covered x-rays, vitals and diagnosis. Itemized bill said $80 for blood pressure!!
They wanted a total of $2,550 to close his wound. I told the doctor we didn't have this kind of money. She went as far as to tell me to ask friends and family for PayPal donations.  We brought our dog home, wound open and in pain but not in "shock". Will take him to a vet clinic as soon as it's open.
You people are crooks, and unscrupulous. I wish I would have read reviews before taking our pup in.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

My sister's dog got hit my a motorcycle a few days ago and we came to this hospital with some hope to save her. We knew she was in pretty bad shape but, we had blind hope.  As soon as we arrived, they were very gentle and made sure to keep informing us on what they were doing with Luna (German Shepard), one of the most comforting thing they did was inform us on how she was licking some of the employees. She was in severe pain and her injuries were worse than we could have ever imagined. There really wasn't much they can do to save her, so we unfortunately had to euthanize her (Rest In Peace, Luna). But I just want to say they were so sympathetic and patience with my sister and I. I really appreciate all they did for us even if there wasn't much to do. Luna was supposed to turn three today (Happy Birthday, RIP).<//review>

On New Years day my chihuahua pom mix, Kimmy, broke her nail and was bleeding a lot.  My daughter tried to pull off the nail at home but Kimmy was screaming in pain, so I had to bring her.  Dr. Southward and everyone there was very caring and helpful.  A tech came out and took her in right away.  The doctor later came out and explained what she wanted to do and made sure Kimmy did not feel any pain.  Thank you guys for being so caring!</text>

<Text>These people will prey on the emotional distress of anybody who loves their sick or injured animal. My little sister's puppy either ate a bee or got scratched by a cat which caused the left side of his jowl to swell over the course of 5 hours. The doctor on duty tried to tell my worried sister and mother that it was a venomous snake bite and that the puppy needs antivenom and over night observation as well as a laundry list of unnecessary treatment and who knows what the total would have been.  I study and collect snakes as a hobby and I know for a fact it was not a snake bite of any kind, yet the doctor insists it was a venomous snake bite...on my 23lb puppy. Were that the case, the puppy would have been dead hours ago. Absolutely predatory and pathetic.</Text><UserId.>109601991711260380243<//UserId.><time>1470812521816< /time>< Pictures>

< Review>
Back in August of 2015, frustrated and financially raped by another vet clinic who didn't do anything but test some blood, i brought my 4mo German Shepherd pup Heidi in. I had just gotten her two days prior, and she was already showing signs of Parvo. Crossroads staff was SO attentive as soon as we walked in, both to Heidi and me as well, and offered a couple of methods of payment that were flexible for my budget. The staff took her in and the Dr. on duty was quick and accurate, and i'm convinced that's why my Heidi is alive and doing typical puppy things, was because of THIS clinic. THANK YOU, i will come here again and recommend to anyone.< /Review>

Very clean hospital.  The staff and doctors are very compassionate.  They explained the procedures that would need to take place until I felt comfortable that I understood.  This is my 2nd time I've had to bring my pets here.  I would definatley recommend Crossroads to anyone I know.<//Review>

My experience at Crossroads Animal Emergency was wonderful. I was impressed with how well they treated my family and our Boston Terrier. I definitely recommend this Crossroads to any pet owner.</text>

<review>This place was horrible. To begin with, these people did absolutely nothing to help my dog. According to them they didn't have the medicine to cure ringworm on my dog. They charged me $110 for absolutely nothing. Keep in mind that ringworm is highly contagious to other pets as well as humans. I am 6 months pregnant and these people sent me home with a contagious pet after charging me $110 for nothing. I wouldn't even recommend this place to my worst enemy. WASTE OF TIME, WASTE OF MONEY, DON'T BOTHER EVER GOING TO THIS PLACE!!!!!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Poodle mix it better than bitten by a pitbull and thank God they were open. They tried to calm me down because they care about the owner as much as I do the pet.My dog had to stay for emergency surgery from the top of the neck I was going to have surgery the next day. My dog some small celebrity on Facebook so they ended up getting 12 or 13 calls asking how late she was doing the next night .It's nice to know you have friends like that then you don't have to family. I needless to say she came back and did fantastic. And I asked him why I couldn't bring lady and then bring the stitches take them out.Tell me calmly said a lot of people want to go to their vet to do that. I had no vet and use people were fantastic and they said of course the real be no charge that soon but the entire bill all the follow-ups are included. I would take my dog back in a heartbeat they just had a funny ours her sometimes are not open in the daytime and that's usually when pets have a shoes .What maybe crossroads does not know that, besides the lady being so nice to meet the manager or supervisor, should I had a cat that had broke his  in the daytime.Norcross words was an open at that time but what's amazing I'm in Long Beach and what they don't tell you is they have a little note on the top of the door in Long Beach at this other place and they said if we're not there or you need more professional emergency help to take your dog or cat to crossroads. That was phenomenal because they have no affiliation with this animal hospital whatsoever<//text>

<text>Staff and doctors were great to my wife, me, and my frenchie.  3 trips in 4 days for ivdd issues.  I get the prices are higher than your normal vet, but do you people leaving one star reviews realize this is an emergency clinic!?!?  Er costs more than my doctor.   Every time.  Especially after hours. Seems like common sense.  I am thankful to have an emergency clinic so close and to have a healthy pup.  Mahalo to all the staff that helped Hamsteak.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I went there last night with my dog who got run over by a car he had a broken leg and 2 ribs. They charge me 800 just to take the x rays and pain medication and wanted to do a surgery that was going to cost over 5,000 thats ridiculous. Plus they didn't know if he was going to loose his leg. They saw my 4 kids crying and didn't give me an option to take him somewhere else cheaper so I end up paying 885 dollars to put my dog to sleep.</text></record>

I had an emergency with my dog. He was having seizures. We arrive there and gave us an estimate of 75 dollar per the visit plus the medicine.  At the end of the night they charged us $1200 for the night. And even though we spend that much money they didn't give our dog medecine. They just give him a relaxing pill. And they said it will only work for that moment. He could have another one in the next minutes so it was just a waste money. Will not recommend this place to any dog owner.</Text>

<Text>I just wanted everyone to know that Crossroads is absolutely the best. I will always be grateful for all the love and care they showed to my little Kanga when she swallowed a piece of thread. I was already feeling pretty down when I had to put my dog to sleep,then I lost my job all in the same week just a couple of weeks before Kanga's incident with the thread... Now , I feared I would lose Kanga too. But thanks to the love and care of Crossroads she is still the lively and special cat I love!  I'm still   always looking for lose threads and any strings on the floor or carpet  because I know she's always carrying things in her mouth (like cat toys etc.)Thank you Doctors and Staff at Crossroads.</Text>< Pics>

This complaint is reguarding Claire Ortega DMV, who was supposed to extract hardened fecal matter from my cat's colon at Crossroads Animal Emergency at 11507 E. Rosecrans Ave. in the city of Norwalk, CA. on Nov. 15th, 2017.

Never during the consultation did Dr. Ortega or any of the staff mention to me that they would NOT be able to extract all the fecal matter in 3.5 hours. If that had been the case, I would have taken the cat to a facility that would spend more time on my pet and get the job done.

Why would I pay Dr. Ortega $1,175 dollars for incomplete work?

This facility also destroyed the x-rays of what fecal matter remained in my cat so that I could not see them. When I asked if they could retrieve them so I could see what they left they wanted to charge me another $100.00 for new x-rays!

Dr. Ortega was more concerned with taking my money and clocking out rather than completing a job she was paid to complete. She was willing to finish what she had begun as soon as the facility opened as long as I PAYED AGAIN?!

Now my cat is still suffering and I have to pay another doctor to finish what Dr. Claire Ortega DVM could not accomplish. This is robbery!

I have also filed a complaint to Veterinary Medical Board about Dr. Ortega's deceit and thieving approach.< /review>

<Text>They killed out cat, the story is the same as the other pets they killed. Biggest mistake you can make is taking your pet to these heartless jerks! They never treat, they just put pets on oxygen and talk to you about how many test you can pay them to do.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>I love you all! You fixed my Mocha's leg!  It broke at the knee when she was running, started screaming so loud the neighbors came out.  Mocha is Chihuhua, Poodle, Terrior.  Buff color with an attitude.  The doctor that put her back together is Amazing!  I forgot her name, she has blonde short hair and sounds like she is from Australia.  Robert in the lobby was also very helpful!  Kudos to your team.  Oh I must say, my Mocha after surgery was of course in pain, but we had the medicine for that and she took no problem.  That very next night I was going to put her in her kennel, when all of a sudden she started screaming!  I was oh god what is happening.  So I left her alone, I tried again and the same thing.  So I called my son Julian, I said she does not want me to move her.  I was thinking because she sleeps in my bed with me and hubby and my Sasha (Chihuahua).  So my son plays with her and she is still medicated from surgery, he puts her in her little house which I have on a chair next to my bed.  She's fine. That night was first night after surgery, so I took her back thinking she was in pain.  They said she was in Euphoria with meds, that it could be.  They gave me more meds just in case.  Well it was me she was screaming at, after the next few nights trying to put her in her cage to sleep, so my son Julian took over that task.  But Again Thank You For All You Have Done For My Mocha.</Text>< username>

< Review>
This facility saved my dog's life. My dog ate a brownie made with marijuana and almost immediately lost control of her legs. My partner and I flipped out, we didn't know what to do or where to go. Additionally, we were new to the area and didn't know who to trust. Crossroads was the first facility we went to, and I couldn't have been happier with their care. Thanks, y'all!< /Review>

< Review>
My dog got ran over by a car, took him here as I was recommended by pico animal hospital. They took him in, made us wait awhile before we got called in. The called us in and waited a while longer, I'm guessing to built emotional suspense. blow fish looking guy came in telling me " you are going to pay 991 sign here" I felt as if I were in a car dealership dealing with a salesman lol I told him as well. Regardless I signed because I honestly believed my dog was going to die. Waited 2 more hours until they called me again and said no surgery was needed that they would HIGHLY recommend me keeping my dog for another night for the small price of 1,700 dollars more. I said no way give me my dog back.
ANYWAY NOT RECOMMENDED. If you can wait until the next day, then do so.
They take advantage of people emotions.<//Review>

<Text>I took my puppy yorkie in because she was vomiting foam, had diarrhea, and shaking. As soon as we got there they refused to help my dog until they approved my credit card. By the time they finished all that my yorkie's heart had stopped beating so they did cpr and werent able to revive her. Even after they took their time, they still charged me almost $400 for the cpr that was done too late. If they had helped my dog when I got there maybe she'd be alive. Vets are supposed to love animals and care for them. These people only care about the money.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Emergency has always cost more that's a no Brainer what bugged me is they already have a amount before you walk in the door we were told it would be between 600 to 900 dollars for diagnostics like xrays blood work of course oxygen which I know my pet needed when I told them I had those and only needed him stabilized so I could transfer him to regular veterinarian my bill still remained in the 800.00 dollar range because now they charged for oxygen and every little thing they did at five times what it would cost at my regular vet and even though things are necessary and it's the middle of the night I don't think gouging people makes a good impression so had I known they were that corrupt I would have made the decision that I ultimately had to make at emergency and put my boy to sleep at his regular vet and avoided the thousand dollar bill for 45 minutes of my boys last time on earth</review>

<Review>Bad experience. Told me what my dog ate could have already done damage in first 30 mins. They took my dog in the back and I waited four hrs until I finally got an update. I asked what was being done this whole time if it was so important to get the treatment started? No good answer given. Said taking vitals? And, I needed to sign off on treatment. Really? I was in the waiting room the entire time. I don't care how busy you are, if you know what treatment needs to be done, bring me the paperwork, let me sign so you can take care of my dog. Never coming back here again. Vets and techs are not the greatest. Front desk staff is condescending. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

<review>when my chiweenie's belly was hard and expanded, had blood in the stool and had a yelping fit, we looked for an emergency vet on google and found crossroads. the staff was very friendly and caring (at first), the facility is clean and seating area is comfy. the staff was patient as we explained the symptoms: hard expanded belly, bright red blood in stool, and we explicitly told them he has a history of back issues. that's all the positive. now the negs... (the wait was very long, which they said was due to a critical case they had, but after reading other reviews, it seems making you wait a long time is part of their psychological tactics) my dog was taken to the back and examined there, which i would have rather had done with me in the room just to be sure it was thorough. the dr then suggested we do xrays, blood work and urinalysis.. which i understand is standard... but we have limited funds, and since he was drinking and eating and not lethargic, we decided to just do the xray first and go from there. the vet then went to the back and came back to tell us about the xray (without showing us the xrays), said there was no obvious blockage, but there wasnt much else they could conclude from just an xray and strongly suggested blood work.. suggested so strongly she came off as a condescending pushy jerk, like she was trying to make us feel bad about not being able to afford the extra tests.. she might have just been on the trailing end of a long shift, but that kind of attitude made me feel like they just cared about getting more money out of us. we have 4 dogs and have had a lot of experience with greedy vets and know enough about vet medicine to know that since it wasnt an obvious blockage, it could wait til the next day when we could see our regular vet.
so the next morning we went to our regular vet... and after looking at the xray for just about a min, he told us the whole problem. yes, he has a back injury, and could clearly see the vertebra that were damaged, 3 points near the tail have significant compression, one is almost completely compressed... that causes my doggie pain when he poops, so he doesnt evacuate completely, which caused constipation and gas... (he showed us on the xray the compressed areas and all the gas pockets which were very clearly visible, if the crossroads vet missed this, they need to go back to school)... the straining from the constipation caused a blood vessel to burst and that was the blood id seen in the stool. he gave us rimadyl for his back pain, and told us to give him gas x for the bloating.
we wouldnt have been able to find the problem without the xray, so thanx to crossroads for doing that.... but they definitely didnt need to do blood work or urinalysis to find the problem. they either were withholding the information about the compressed vertebra and gas to force us to do the other testing, or their vets just arent educated enough to figure out this very simple problem.
this experience just adds to the reasons why i would travel a thousand miles to get to tags a1 in santa clarita to see their honest vets.
in case of an extreme life threatening emergency, sure, get your pet to any facility that can help, even if they're greedy bastards.
crossroads' estimate for xrays, blood work, and urinalysis was almost $600 (just the visit and xray was almost $300) , and then there would be a cost for whatever treatment they would have recommended and boarding costs to keep him there for 'observation'. the cost at my regular vet for the consultation and medication was less than $100, and problem solved.
**and now that i have looked through their reviews, the positive ones are mostly vague and seem fake...  i hate how places like this take advantage of distressed people who love their pets. this is the reason why at hermon dog park's yappy hour we often have pet education seminars with honest vets to go over basics. we need to be educated so we dont get screwed over.

PS, not nice to try to hide my review just because it reveals your bad practices. erase it again and i will repost<//review><pics>None</pics>< Rate>

Friendly staff and very clean, but unecessary long waiting, after being check by the vet over 20mins wait for an estimate, dont like the fact that they take your pet away where you cant see to check virals an all, long wait to see the vet and long wait to leave, also a bit over priced.</text>

If your low Income dont come here.

My cat was attacked by a dog and the wound got infected, I took her as soon as I saw the wound.
If my animal has another emergency I wont be coming here.
I'll start with the good, they were nice, they helped me immediately, they explained thoroughly the problem and the procedure.
The bad, dont expect to pay less than $200, you have two options pay with care credit or cash. They pretty much wanted me to pay $1367 upfront though they said "we dont want to rush or push you into choosing the $1800 option" I chose the cheaper one since I wanted to help my cat but I only work part time $9/hr for 16 hrs, my brothers girlfriend had to loan me $867 to pay. First of all it was suppose to be less than that they called me at 1am to tell me they had to fully anesthetize my cat because the infectiom was too deep and it would be another $180, I didnt have anymore money I used all my savings to pay not more than 30 minutes before. so my friend had to loan me more but they needed her confirmation they called me several times because they wanted her to send it immediately or they wouldnt start! I told them she had to work at 6am but they still wanted me to call her, after I told them she wasnt answering probably because she was asleep they wanted me to keep calling her.
I went to sleep around 3 am and was suppose to pick her up at 9am. They didnt give me any medication, they gave her antibiotics and they stapled her up.
Well guess what 4 days later her wound had become reinfected what I took for discharge as they had warned me of was not. Her wound became undehescent and I was going to put her down because they wanted to charge me another $1300 for their mistakes. They did not clean the infection out thoroughly and she had to be stitched closed not stapled because of the type of wound plus they just folded the skin over and placed the staples which wouldn't promote healing. Then there was only one option left to put her to sleep which would be $200! Well I decided I would take her to the LA animal care & control and put her to sleep but a miracle happened the ASPCA gave me a coupon and she had her surgery again for $225. Shes way better now no thanks to Crossroads.  They're nice but their policy is one where money is what decides whether theyre gonna do all they can for your pet.  Go somewhere else, this place should be a last resort.< /Review>

<time>1388107707174<//time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Staff was great, though the vet Dr Mc Donald is a horrible horrible vet, will never go to this place again while he is a vet there. My dog had a seizure one night and we had just adopted him from the pound only a couple months before so we did not know he had them. When we took him there at midnight right when the seizure happened the staff were great making us know things will be ok and they would be able to work with our budget and do what they can, though as soon as Dr Mc Donald shows up he starts accusing us of giving our dog DRUGS! the heck is wrong with him... My mother who was not even there with us was brought into the conversation by the doctor he was trying to say she gave our dog marijuana just because my dog had a seizure! He wanted us to pay $200 just so he could give him coal to dilute his stomach.

We decided just to pay the visit and wait until the next day to visit our usual vet at the  Downey landing, there they told us that our dog naturally had seizures and that there were no 'drugs' found in his system ...

WILL NEVER NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE! The Dr. only tried milking money out of us just because we were young he thought we were stupid!! and TREATED US LIKE WE WERE!! He should not be allowed to work as a FAMILY veterinarian if he is going to be treating people like they are stupid or that they are poisoning their pets with drugs!

<rating>5<//rating><text>FYI: I am medical Professional and am familiar with the nuances of Orthopedic Surgery and have done countless HOURS of research to find Dr Blackwood, one of THE few proficient in CCL TIGHTROPE Surgery. We traveled from Las Vegas, it WAS WORTH IT!!

STATS: Mr Mighy is 75lb Pitbull Terrier
DEFECT:
Ruptured and Completly torn Cranial Cruciate Ligament [CCL]
PROCEDURE:
TIGHTROPE Repair using KEVLAR CARBON COMPOSITE
BENEFITS:
Decrease Surgical Recovery, Less Invasive than other more freq performed procedures
DIFFICULTY:
a. Finding a Orthopediuc Surgeon Proficient and comfortable enough to Increase the odds for Positive Outcome
b. The mass MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN by other Vets that will sell you what it is THEY are confined knowledge of.
OUTCOME: Found, Dr Blackwood, HIGHLY PROFICIENT ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON in CCL Repair. IMO: Dr Blackwood is a Sleeping Giant in this Field. Her mild manner and demeanor, dont let this fool you. She awakens the GIANT inside her when it comes to the OR ! UNBELIEVEABLE!

Our Letter TO Dr Blackwood and CROSSROADS ANIMIAL HOSPITAL:

Dear Dr Blackwood: I cannot begin to tell you one of lifes BIGGEST pleasures is seeing such a POSITIVE outcome w. the CCL Surgery you had done on MIGHTY.

Now 4 months out and watching mighty run in the field we take him for a walk at, and to glide so effortlessly.
That is SO FULFILLING and heartwarming.

We do owe his success story to your skilled and most excellent efforts! Thank You for being one of the few who are so proficient in this Tightrope procedure in the WEST.

Thank you again so so much! Words could never describe the Joy I have on a regular basis seeing this dog Do so well now. For sure we never know how lucky we are till we lose such a function, then regain it. PRICELESS!< /text></record>

They wanted to remove my cat's eyeball!!!!

2am...I hear a cat crying at the door. It was my black kitten. His beautiful yellow eyes were seeping red liquid. He had a large gash from his lid to below his eye. Immediately I took him into my arms and brought him in the house. All I could do was hold him and love him. I didn't know what to do. My poor kitten's eye was bleeding. A cat must have scratched him.

My boyfriend is a DJ, so I waited for him to come home to see what we should do and what our finances would allow. 3:30am...immediately we searched for a 24 hours clinic and we found Crossroads.

The representative was nice and welcoming on the phone and in person. Of course there was no wait. The took him to the room to be examined. The nurse said his eye has a scratch and must be removed for $2000 or it would be infected and he will die in 2-3 days. Another option is to put the kitten to sleep...Definitely not our option. My boyfriend hugged me tighter. We didn't know what our other options were. We did not have the funds to complete this surgery today. We did, however, get him antibiotics and a few other medicine. It's expected that cost will be higher than a regular vet. We paid $500 for examination and medicine to take home.

I held my kitten as much as I could knowing that he might die in a few days....

It has been 1 year now and his eyes look perfect. I can't believe he could have walked around with no eye and eyelid sewn shut. I cannot believe a hospital would do such a thing just to get money. My cat lady neighbor (she has had over 100 cats in her lifetime) said that was absurd. This happens a lot to cats who are not neutered and it heals itself. So, would I recommend this place? Not necessarily unless you absolutely have to take your pet in. There are other places that was recommend to me that I will go to next time if my pet has an emergency...that will not offer to remove my kitten's eye.< /Review>

My Dog Chico had a issue with his Jaw which I thought was dislocated from him playing with my other Dog ... it ended up being a piece of plastic from a zip log bag he got into,. the piece was stuck in far back which I could not see myself ... needless to say I was not charged and the staff was awesome ... shout out to Angela for taking care of my pup.</text>

They are EXTREMELY expensive. Like, 900 bucks for a  exam, X-rays and pain shot. Be prepared to spend a lot of money, they after your wallet< /Review>

<Date>1615095781423<//Date><rating>1< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) Bottom line: don't go here. They only care about money. The first thing they do is charge you $ 95 before asking about your pet. Absurd. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY and ENERGY!

(Original)
En resumen: no vayas aquí. Solo les importa el dinero. Lo primero que hacen es cobrarle $ 95 antes de preguntar por su mascota. Absurdo. ¡NO PIERDA SU TIEMPO, DINERO y ENERGÍA!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2d2b24ef27af3:0x29927b7ee3e5612a< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Went here on the advice of Yelp and it was a good call.  The guy who helped me out (Joey) was friendly & professional.  They scan you with this electronic doodad that tells if you have pronated feet.  I bought two pairs (both recommended for somewhat flat footed runners) and they were each less than $100, so pretty reasonable I think.  Before this I went to Fleet Feet, which is also good but a bit harder to get to from where I live in the Castro.  It's a toss up between the two but you can't go wrong either way as far as I know.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Really great customer service! The staff there were very accommodating in assisting me with returning my initial shoe purchase and special ordering a pair of work shoes that they didn’t carry in store.

In regards to industry specific work shoes, this location has a great selection to choose from.

Make sure you ask for Brandon, Aaron or Martha who were super friendly and patient with me. If they have don’t have a particular work shoe/style in stock, they’ll out of their way to help you find what you need.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808e345b75b1dd75:0xd678fd7bc084574c</gmap_id></record>

<text>I've quite literally never experienced customer service like this.  As soon as I walked in Matt addressed me by name, offered me water, listened to my needs, made suggestions but never pressured me into buying anything I didn't need or couldn't afford.  I'll be back again, selection was great but the experience reminded me of why it's always worth it to support local.</text>< GmapID>

I went to this store earlier today (03/13/2019) at around 7 pm.  When I went into the store, there were no customers  in the store but one man at the counter acknowledged and welcomed me.  I told the guy that I was looking for a pair of running shoes but also did not know what to look for when choosing running shoes. He led me to the running shoes section and also to a scanning machine and scanned my feet so that proper fitting shoes can be selected.

However when new customers (a couple, man and woman together) walked into the store, the worker's  attention completely went to the new people. He sat me in the chair, saying "let me get them some boots real quick and I'll be right back".  However he stayed with the couple, helping the man to try the boots and started ringing the cash register.

I don't know what prompted the worker to attend the other customers before me (maybe they looked wealthier and more likely to make the purchase?) but it was very clear that I came into the store first. I walked out of the store when the worker was ringing the cash register for the other customers.</review>

<Text>I came in to get boots for my new job.
My job gave me a piece of paper with the specifications the boots had to meet and woman showed me all of my options.
I described my daily activities and she helped me narrow down to a few boots that would suit my needs.
Very friendly. Very professional. Store is clean.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<review>Worst experience ever never got offerd help.

Great place for fresh food, fast! The other thing is most items are available in this location 24 hours a day. This is the closest place to where I spend most of my time so I am here day or night and rain or shine. The French Fries hit the spot when nothing else will do. -WE< /Review>

They served us cold hard burritos as if made the day before and refrigerated til the next day. The guac was brown and the burger was as thin as a sheet of paper! Very disappointed and will NOT be going back!!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

Convenient, close and good food. Offers senior discount. Good prices with wide variety of American Mexican food. Have chosen Del Taco over other AmerMex fast food places. Consistently good.<//Review>

I didn't have the chance to purchase anything.  After I placed my order and the girl gave me my total ($48.65) I gave her a $100 bill and she said " I don't have any change" and asked me do you have any smaller? I told her no and said I'm paying almost $50 and then she tells me well we don't accept $100 bills. I asked for a manager but she said she was one of them...so I cancelled my order and drove across street to the next Mexican Restaurant.</text>

Good food but this was by far the worst service I have experience. I've waited one hour just to order (six cars in front of me) and when I got up to the window the worker tells me, "only exact change" no friendlyness or sense of urgency what so ever.  WOW!</Text>

<userid>113763434483970067656</userid><Review>A complete disappointment. I stopped going to Del Taco near my home on Mission Trail as well as the one on Central. Looks like I will have to go out of the area to get Del Taco. This place butchered my order (number 1 combo and guac) then handed me a bag covered in guacamole. The employees do not know the menu. Stupid. Incompetent. Lazy. I asked for a clean bag. I was given a SMALL bag to small for my order.</Review>< Name>

Horrible service. Went here last night to order food well before closing time. Employees were not serving or answering the intercom. Stuck in the drive thru waiting behind someone who thought they were going to be served. Will be calling corporate. Absolutely unacceptable to not service customers during work hours.<//Review>

Something is off about this place lately. The food has not been good. They also clean all of their stuff VERY early (again, this is new) so your options are limited on what you can order. Basically if it requires a grill 3 hours prior to closing they won't make your food. We will continue to go to the location off Scott Rd. moving forward. Far too many disappointments in the last few months.</Review>

This drive-thru was the longest wait I have ever experienced to the point where I started honking. I only went for a gift card (inside was closed) and then they tell me they don't have any. So at that point I got a dam quesadilla and left.</text>

*Make the food as if it was you that was going to eat it and if it was your money you were spending.
*Handle Drive-Thru as if you were the one waiting. (Take one order inside and take one order Drive-Thru) keeps both lines moving.<//review>< Pics>

I dont know about you but Im not a BIG fan of cold food thru a drive thru. Fries were awful and the rest of my food order was as if the food had been made hours before... Not what I like.. Waste of money. One positive was the lady taking my order was nice and polite so hey not a complete horrible experience.<//Text>

Like some other reviewers have said, DONT COME HERE AT NIGHT. At first we found out they were out of chips, fries and carbonated drinks. We were hesitant but kept a positive attitude because some nights are crazy and it’s understandable. Then we got our food. It was FROZEN. The tortillas were frozen, the vegetables were frozen. It was inedible. We couldn’t just let it go. Whoever works at night needs to manage their shifts better, if I was the owner I would retrain or REPLACE them.<//review>

<Review>This place is an absolute atrocity. They either overcharge, mess up your order, or try and short you items you paid for. Only try this location if you have NO other options and be diligent in checking for mistakes. They straight up forgot about my order once. They’re also really slow too. -5 out of 5 stars. At a certain point I just had to reconcile with myself that they are going to keep messing up - so it’s my fault for going there in the first place.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc9dc6397e4819:0x9722a863891d46cd<//Gmap_id></record>

If they for whatever reason are going to keep these tiny Burritos for some price point etc then will they atleast give a larger burrito option on menu. Otherwise Del-Taco you will loose our business completely just like Taco-Bell already has.<//text>< Response>

Still the worst Del-Taco of all time, this location continues to break new bounds as to how awful a restaurant can be. It's mind boggling how atrocious this place truly is. I settle for this location probably once every two years because I know how much it blows. The food at this location is ALWAYS cold and missing ingredients, every single time I order here, and I mean every time, not just some times. Last night I ordered a classic chicken burrito and received nothing but lettuce and cheese wrapped in an ice cold tortilla, I'm not kidding.< /text>

We went through their drive thru about 8:30pm. We pre-ordered in the parking lot area because the dine in doors were locked. It took awhile to get to the window. They were out of the shakes we ordered with no way to remove them from our prepaid bill. The cashier offered me two new types of drinks to try. Both were sprite with little flavored balls in the drinks. The two flavors are mango & cherry. Both were tasty and fun. She gave us a choice of colored straws that were angled with a wide opening to get those flavors to come up through the straw. I appreciate the extra effort spent to make up for the shakes. The staff was under pressure and fulfilled the orders with grace.<//text>

Most of the time they are fast, unless you walk in to a rush. Good food, decent price, and decent service. I've been a Del Taco customer all my life. As a chain they are consistent. I always know what to expect.</review>

Honestly 90% of the time my order is correct but #1 issue lately for past few months has been almost zero salt on their tasteless fries. Frustrating cause that's almost the main reason I go there.<//review>

<Text>Just go inside to order, you'll have better luck doing that. Drive though is very slow and basically makes this establishment's fast food title void. I don't know why, they are just never fast. But that is just the service, I gave this a three star because I always come back for the food, if I have time, ill wait.</Text>< Resp>

<text>Stoped by here for lunch, I normally don't do fast food but I gave it a shot. The order taker was polite, seemed all was well until I got my order, I did not recieve my fries for my combo so got back in the drive thru line to correct the order and decided I wanted a chili fries also, I explained to the cashier if it was a plain chili frie and the frie they forgot in the new bag she said yes. When I got home Checked the chili fries it was jus fries no chili, the strawberry lemonades were so watered down it was disgusting, they also forgot my order of two tacos and ruined not mine but also my kids lunch no chilli fries and no tacos for my kids who I ordered for. Not sure of this is the worst DEL TACO or if I should jus give up on fast food in all. Triple check your bags and don't worry about cars behind you, hopefully the employees don't mind when you want to correct your order.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dc9dc6397e4819:0x9722a863891d46cd</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We pick up for postmates regularly. They never have anything prepared and it takes them forever to get it ready. They tell you to pick up your order inside but they always have their doors locked so you cant get in. They never know qhich order is ours and even when we order food for ourselves its not as good as other del tacos. I would just avoid this Del Taco if at all possible.</Review>

I’ve been in this drive through for 21 minutes now. (The line was NOT long at all). Still haven’t ordered my food in fact I’m still sitting here at the order intercom waiting on someone to say something at all to me. Only go here if you have nothing going on that day and no where to be.</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Tuesday and Thursday Taco night sounds great but they serve small tacos with very small amount of meat with more then plenty of lettuce in the center and cheese on top. Some of the tacos have one bite of meat and the rest of the tacos had lettuce and dry hard cheese. This Del Taco fast food store SUCKS!!!!
This is not the first time they served botched orders. They can't even get a Del Taco party pack right.
No more spending hard earned money at this sad del taco.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Wait for the drive thru was wayyyy too long and after all that they forgot one of our main items from the order.
No recpeit was given and we had to wait through their painfully slow drive thru again. They gave us the item no hassle about the recpeit so theres that I guess< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I'm not sure exactly when or why things started to go downhill at this location but they have. This  one used to be our go to & even when I get our food late nights this was the go to place. Food doesn't taste the same, the food is not fast, and multiple times that we've been here we've  been told that their system is down. It's not working and unable to take orders. Or we've been told that their grill is being cleaned they're not able to make food.  It's sad, hopefully this location can bounce back in all aspects customer service food, etc.< /review>

Worst Del Taco ever. They take forever, always mess up the order, and it seems like they are in crisis mode the entire time they are working. Don't even dare go through the drive-thru, because then you are trapped while they take their sweet time. The legend has spoken.</Review>

<Text>Gotta say this is the worst Del Taco I've ever been to. Why you ask? They claim to be open 24 hours, yet every time I have attempted to visit them between the hours of midnight and 5 am, they claimed to be closed for end of day shift or something? And can't take any orders.

The fact that I've visited this establishment multiple times and haven't even been able to order food is frankly ridiculous. And I am highly inclined to believe every negative review about this location.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

This place doesn’t even deserve 1 star! This is the closest Del Taco to my house and so I’ve been here a few times and question why I continue to return!!! It’s the worst, ever! Drive thru is ALWAYS extra slow and the they cover up their timer! It took 27 mins and there was 4 cars in front of me! They obviously don’t follow Del Tacos standards because none of their food is up to standards whatsoever. Their management is horrible and the customer is never put first! Corporate really needs to step in and make some changes! Avoid this Del Taco!!!!

6/4/2020
I was here about a month ago and had the above issue and called corporate and they sent me a $10 voucher. Anyway, today I went to that Del taco with a positive attitude in hopes that I could use my $10 voucher without having any issues. Boy, was that a joke! I went to go use my voucher inside and the manager said their register wasn’t working and I would have to come back another time. I said that this voucher expires in a couple days and I didn’t  want to come back and if  there was something else they could do for me. After going round and round for about five minutes she suggested that I get back into my car and go through the drive-thru )which was 7 cars deep) because that register will take my Voucher. I was super upset and asked her why she couldn’t just walk over to the drive-thru register and put in my order and she said that she couldn’t interrupt the drive-thru girl taking orders. At this point I’m fuming. I ended up walking out, going home and calling corporate once again! Management has to step up their game! This is absolutely ridiculous!</Text>

They've got the new El Carbone chicken tacos and the chicken crunch burrito boats for $0.99 and both of them are super delicious. And you can't beat the large strawberry lemonade with extra strawberry all smiles 😁< /Text>

<text>Del Taco has the best shakes! Theyre even better than In&Out, which a lot of people say are good. Their bean burritos are a little bland, but definitely more hearty than the other chain's burritos.<//text>< pics>

Horrible service. Bin here a few times because it’s closest to home but I always get the same BS. No fries because they’re cleaning, out of chicken or steak, they get my order wrong, or they have a bad attitude. I still don’t understand why this place remains open considering all the issues management obviously never addresses.<//Review>

Worst Del Taco ever! 30-40 minutes just to go through drive-tru. Then I get my food and they messed up on my order. Burned quesadillas and burned chicken in my burrito. This place is going downhill fast!!< /Review>

This has to be one of the worst locations. The employees make this a 2 star. The orders are often wrong, you have to repeat your order several times and they cheap out on ingredients. Cash only today. But why put a sign or tell anyone while ordering? So you can sit in line to waste food and your time. This franchise owner should just give up and sell to someone competent of managing a restaurant.</Text>

This is the second time I've been to this del taco where the person in the Drive-Thru was incredibly rude. I don't trust this place now because they probably will spit in your food.< /Review>

The restaurant is fairly clean at all times. However on occasion their staff is short handed and the lobby area seems to suffer. Kitchen and Flores are taken care of as well. The cashier also helped prep the food but took the time to put gloves on in order to prevent cross contamination. Overall, speed of delivery of food was good but could have been better. More attention was focused on the drive thru and my order took a couple minutes longer to deliver.</Text>

<text>I didn’t get my order correctly and I called they said they would replace it when I called. After picking up my son I’m heading back and hour later I go through the drive through and ask to speak with the manager because I had called. The manager accused me of lying and said that I came in through walk in when I called she said they close walk in at 10 p.m. I wasn’t going to make it there in 10 minutes. Then when I asked for more meat instead of getting free fries the manager says again she already replaced it and then asked how did I know about the free fries and I told her that she told me over the phone. I eventually got the burrito but because of how they are acting the employees and manager I am actually dreading eating it since I don’t know if they spit in it dropped the tortilla on purpose or didn’t wash their hands after touching anything that is dirty.  This is by far the worst experience here.</text><Pics>None</Pics></record>

The guy who works the counter hides around the corner while the line piles up. The kitchen doesn't make food in any kind of order. Some people are in and out in 2 minutes while other people wait for a half hour. No visible management whatsoever. Completely absurd.</text>

The difference in freshness between this location and any other is astounding. I've never had orders messed up more at any location in my life. Not even little things, I'm talking about nachos with no cheese on them, asking for no tomatoes and getting no meat along WITH tomatoes, being charged the wrong amount for something (95% of the times I've gone here) etc.</review><user_name>Scott Bendixen<//user_name>< pics>

SANITARY ISSUES. Employees don’t wash hands after walking outside to their car to turn off car alarm. Karen(mgr) is ask HORRIBLE. Her customer service is trash along with the service. Was told it was there fault when their employee hands my order off to someone else & I ask for a refund she gives me attitude.  The guy who gave my order away walks outside touching the entrance door & car keys to shut off his alarm, comes back inside & grabs a order of churros & puts them
In a bag to a customer. NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN.< /Text>

False advertising on the sweet treats, it shows three different item on the menu for a dollar but only the shake and the donut bite are a dollar. Why are  the caramel cheese bite, advertised on the same menu? Also the alarm on the fryers keep going off and not been turned off. That is so annoying.<//Text>

<text>Never been to a fast food restaurant where it's so dirty, messy and so slow. Clearly they were understaffed. There were crumbs and spills on the floor and table and nobody clean it.

< review>
If the front counter customer service wasn't so good, I'd give this location one star. The cooks always mess up our meals and they are always greatly understaffed. Not the employees fault but, whoever is setting the budget hours needs to rethink how they run a business. The employees are working hard but, waiting 35 minutes for two bean and cheese burritos that get messed up and you have to wait another 10 is way too long.< /review>

Make sure to get a receipt they have charged me extra multiple times and they never apply coupons to my order. If management sees this review then please retrain your employees if this has happened to me multiple times then its happening to everyone. I will be paying cash only at this location from now on no more handing over my debit card and hoping they don't overcharge me</Review>

Don't waste your money at THIS Del Taco. They always short your order. Food is poorly prepared. Drive to the other side of the 215 on Newport and go to that Del Taco, or any other Del Taco.<//review>

< Review>
This Del Taco is always busy. Only one time I did not receive some of my order and the manager corrected it immediately. The staff is friendly. Del Taco uses more fresh ingredients as compared to Taco Bell. The drive thru moves fast. Google says it is inside Stater Brothers, but it is not. They are separate buildings.< /Review>

<Text>The girl taking our order had an attitude,  acting lime she didn't want to be there, slammed on cup down, didn't take my order right, then my husband asked if he could ge t his cup, she told him his order didn't come with a drink after she had asked him if he wanted one, he said he wanted one having total attitude again w hen she was in tghe wrong, then slammiing her drawer twice, my husband asked if she was ga being a bad day, she walked away, then other customers came in and she disappeared, so.eone else had to take their order, NEVER have we experienced this at Del Taco.< /Text><rate>2<//rate><response>None<//response><pictures>None</pictures><name>Cheryl Cooper<//name><user>107203702124311151933</user>< Date>

Good food but they make you pay for sour cream, I guess equivalent to the other taco place calling it a supreme and charging more. Overall good<//Text>

Food was not bad but I  went  to  the  counter to ask for a bag and I  couldn't  believe  what  a mess  I saw  on the  floor. If I  would have  had the # to health inspector  I  would have called  immediately.  Never going back again.<//Review>

<Review>Food is cheap and good. Service is not. Wether you go through the drive thru or order inside, service will be slow. I understand they're busy and need to cater to others but if they are making the same food all day I would assume they would become skilled at working quickly.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Service normal as drive-thru used and line average in length. French fries had been refried a couple of times so the entire order of fries was not fit to eat for anyone! Rest of the order was palatable!</Text>

<review>Every time I go its an average 20 min or more wait in drive up. Than the orders are always wrong.  I should not have to open the wrapped food to check if its correct. *even then its hard to tell*. Horrible service. They have lost my future business.....</review>< pics>

My order here is wrong and/or cold every single time, I've been over charged, and disrespected. I condemn this location and all who inhabit it. Stick to Antelope Shell station or Mission Trail.. or Lenwood Del Taco ;)< /Review>< Pics>

<review>It was just ok. The Tuesday 3 taco special for 1.27 was so skimpy on the filling probably 1 tbls of meat and cheese. Had the burrito plate, burrito was ok, rice and beans had no flavor at all.<//review>< time>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>This is the worst del taco on the planet.  I've had to take food back so many times its ridiculous. If you ask (and pay) for extra cheese or meat - you won't get it. The employees couldn't pour water out of a boot with the instructions on the heel. Save yourself frustration and head down to El pollo Loco on Newport and Haun.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

They have the worst service of all the Del Tacos around. I'll eat somewhere else instead of being treated so rudley. 80 % of the time they get the order wrong.</review>
