*Buyer Beware - Fake Cards*
The guys running the place are inexperienced scalpers/flippers selling everything well above market value. I bought a Jungle Holo Jolteon and French Base Set Holo Raichu, raw cards for maybe $100-$120 for both cards, can't remember since I bought other stuff as well. Anyways, turns out both of the cards (on complete different sides of the shelf) were actually FAKE cards. Man, I thought "Real Pokemon Enthusiasts" could tell the difference between real and fake cards, or maybe they already knew...
Pictures attached
On the Raichu, it's a printed plastic sheet glued on a card that's completely foiled.
On the Jolteon, you can see the shiny metalic foil peeking through on the edges, all the way around the card. It's also sitting next to the exact REAL card that's non-holo and the color difference is huge. It was also ripped and the back side of it is shown in the last photo</review>

Recently went to the store it is still doing business thankfully. They were very helpful and patient as I looked over their inventory more then once. If you are of fan of trading card games such as Magic, Yugioh, or Pokemon then this store is for your. Once again walked away with some gems at a very reasonable price.</Review>< pics>

<Review>A/C didn't work, prices were really high on products, almost double on some items. Workers weren't willing to negotiate on prices and on top of all that, one of their team members straight up told us that they bought some of their stock (way higher prices then retail & whole sale) just to turn around and sell in their store for higher, not very professional, wouldn't recommend and suggest they buy whole sale.<//Review>< rate>

This is a great laundry, they have a lot of washer/dryer machines with different sizes. It is very convenient when you have a lot and little to wash. I like coming here because their customer service is excellent, especially Doris. She is always helping all customers being nice and friendly. I give her 100%.< /text>

I have been coming here to wash for about 4 years but I can say that for the last year this laundry has been the best place I had come to the place is always always clean (Doris) is always cleaning and very helpful with any needs the clients. The only bad side is that I wish it could be open 24 hrs so we as customers can come as we need without worrying they will be close. I would definitely recommend this laundry mat<//Text>

Although the sign says you get $22 credit, that's not true. It's clean, and they have great machines. When I called Brandi I was kinda mad I didn't get $22 like the sign says, she was so nice, had excellent customer service.

<review>In order to wash here you must purchase a card for 4 dollars, plus whatever money you need to wash. It must be exactly 4 dollars, and the dryers dont dry very good. The restrooms are clean, you need a quarter so make sure you get change if you know you'll be there a while. There are some vending machines, tables and chairs all the way to the left when you first enter. There is a door in that area that leads to the winchells next door. There is a little claw machine as well. Overall staff are attentive, and the place is clean. Just not the place for someone who only has a few bucks to dry.</review>< pics>

<Time>1589556025680</Time><rate>1<//rate><text>(Translated by Google) A few days ago I called and sent mail because when I add a balance to my card to wash, I do not add it, pay with a debit card and call and several days have passed and nothing has answered my calls except the emails.

It is clean but they are not responsible for anything ..

Hace unos dias llame y envie correo ya que al agregar saldo a mi tarjeta para lavar no me lo agrego, pague con tarjeta de debito y llame y ya han pasado varios dias y nada que me contestan mis llamadas menos los correos..

Esta limpia pero no se hacen responsable de nada..<//text>< Pics>

<Text>I hand my hair cut there on Friday. Ryan was the barber that cut my hair. He listened to my instructions, then proceed to cut my hair just like I asked him to. I was in and out in 20 minutes with a new look. The salon was clean, they sterilize everything after each new customer, and they only charge $23 for a cut. I will go back again!</Text>< response>

<Review>I did my haircut for the first time here and it was terrible. There was an old lady there that literally does nothing on your hair , I could get my hair done much better at home. Besides she was not friendly at all. If you wanna waste your money and experience a terrible atmosphere go check this place! Specially if u are not white American u will get extra sarcastic  complements from the old lady to add to your terrible experience there!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I got a haircut with Sheri the owner about 3 weeks ago. It was my first time there and I asked if they knew how to do fades. A co-worker responded saying that sheri was an expert. When Sheri started on my hair she asked me how I wanted it and never checked back with me on how it was looking. She took less than 10 minutes and when she was done she didn't even show me the results. When I got home i checked in the mirror and was very disappointed that it hadn't turned out how I wanted. Seemed like she didn't care how my hair looked as long as it was cut. I tried talking to her at work and wasn't there every time I went. I left my Phone number about 5 times and till this day waiting on her phone call. I would not recommend this place to get a simple haircut yet alone rely on her customer service.<//Text>

My son (4) and I went in to get our cuts. My son has only had a barber cut once and we were attentative to him as he had it done since our past experiences were difficult.
I was first up so I sat down and he sat in the chair beside me and watched. The next seat became available so the young lady came over and asked if he wanted to go next. I left it up to him and she quickly talked him into it all the way accross the room to her booth. I watched as she made him comfortable a kept talking to him and even showed him how safe the clippers were before going around his ears. Very professional and very sweet people. My cut was phenomenal compared to most places I've been to. I will be going back.<//review>

<text>Standard Dunkin Donuts fare from a kiosk. They say they will occupy a space next to Subway, but who knows when that'll happen. The lines can get very long at times, so they really need to make that move soon so they can improve on the time it takes to get served. The people that work here are very friendly though, and they are working as fast as they can. I'm not really a donuts person, but I like their coffee.</text><Resp>None</Resp>< user_id>

Wonderful park with a big USA rocket ship play ship. Some men are playing soccer on the field outdoors. And plenty of space to walk on the shade amongst the trees. Also, there another playground near the steps that go down to the elementary school where there are men playing basketball outdoors. Great park!< /text>

This park is so trim and proper. I come here to practice baseball with my nephew. The field is well groomed, the grounds are tidy. I love this place.< /review>

The play structure here is a little small but our kids love the rocketship theme. They have aptly nicknamed it Rocketship Park! 🚀 There are a couple of big kids swings, but no infant swings. Due to the height of the structure, I'd recommend this Park for ages 3+. It's fun for littles too, but will likely require adult supervision.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Very nice, it looks very safe. The only detail is that there are no bathrooms available.

<review>Employees are not educated practices of sanitation and mask wearing.

An elder 50s female long dirty blonde hair spoke unfashionably and profanity to a friend about differences in mask and face shield.

These Employees should be OSHA & HIPPA Trained. As well as have respect for their consumers.

It's open till 11 and the gass pumps work all night on gas cards or credit/debit cards.
Diesel.
Decent coffee, more than the basic food options.
Busy all the time.</Text>

<review>New gas pumps up and running!
Watch locals fight at the pumps like you're in Alabama 50 years ago. Give that dog some water you bloody tweaker! Friendly stoned staff wondering why their there and not working on the hill. No. I don't have any trim work for you.<//review>< Pictures>

I really wanted to like this place. It's within walking distance of my work.
Paid $10 for one of the worst burritos I've ever paid for. This is worse than fast food quality and the smallest portions I have ever seen. The CA burrito. I even asked the guy if it was a good size and he said Oh yeah. I literally have to go buy more food now.
Never coming here again. Wow. They were not even busy either. This literally feels like a trash taco bell burrito.</Text>

Excellent hot dogs and garlic fries! A real Dodger blue kinda place with a menu full of the teams stars.  Lots of pictures with the players inside too.  Huge mural of Vin Scully in the parking lot.  Food is good and quick and fairly cheap. Great lunch spot.< /Text>

<Review>Absolutely delicious. Good prices and portions. The chicken teriyaki bowl with special fried rice is quite the flavor bomb. Also has some cute arcade cabinets if you feel inclined to play a game or two with friends.< /Review>< pics>

These reviews looked good so we decided to try this. We wanted some good fish tacos because this is the Southern California and we should be able to get good fish tacos in SoCal. The tacos were cut up fish sticks, not fresh fish. They are over dressed with the sauce and there is no pico de Gallo as promised. They forgot the guacamole I paid extra for and the garlic French fries I ordered. Not excited about this at all.< /review>

<Review>This place is amazing. I stopped in for lunch and was blown away by the chef’s special si sig tacos. I’ve been eating lunch from here a few times a week now just to try everything. From the wings & tacos to the burgers & bull dog it has all been unique and delicious. I highly recommend eating here.< /Review>< Pics>

The menu is a great mix- the flavors are great. I tried the Burrito California Al Pastor, my friend got the chicken tacos. There is limited seating, but we had plenty of room for our stroller. Parking behind the restaurant is nice, and we love the Vin Sculley mural. Worth a try if you’re in the area and craving Asian, Mexican, or a good burger.<//review>

First of SISIG! Their sisig is freshly made unlike other places, I'm not against that but when it's freshly made its crispier lol maybe it's just my preference :)

Customer service is amazing. The place is nothing fancy but if you're looking for a quick, and delicious bite. This place is a must

If you've never been here like me. The parking is in the back so you don't have to worry about parking in the street<//Text>

The California Burrito was delicious. The burrito was very tasty and with lots of flavor. This was my first time trying out this place thanks to Uber eats I ordered 2 California Burritos one for my Mom and one for me and it didn't disappoint. I am definitely coming back in person to eat at the restaurant. Good stuff. Excellent job very satisfied with my food.<//text>

The food is top quality, and the menu has different choices for just about any palette. The owner is friendly and will cater to your needs. They're always looking for new and exciting ideas to please their customers. If you love good food, good vibes in a great family type atmosphere the TORO is definitely for you.<//text>< Rate>

<rating>5<//rating><text>This by far is my favorite Asian Fusion go to. My main gotta haves are either the sisig burrito/sisig fries or the classic aioli burger ! They have a wide variety in menu from wings to tacos. Even when waiting for the food, you have something to do ! They have that classic Metal Slug game which brought back memories lol They also accommodate variety of people where they'll put on a game on one tv and a movie on the other tv. For example, I was watching the Dodger playoff games, while watching Ready Player One for the first time. Overall, a great experience eating here!</text>< pictures>

<text>A friend recommended this restaurant to me and it was great! It's a little hard to get into since it's close to the entrance/exit of the freeway, but other than that the food is amazing! Only had the burrito and burgers, but I'm going back for more.<//text>< response>

I probably go here once every week. Probably the best al pastor tacos I've had here in the valley. The owner is really nice. Along side the delicious food, there are several gaming stations and televisions set up where customers can use and play around with. Definitely a recommended spot!!</text>

First time here and I tried the aioli burger that they recommended, did not disappoint. Everything they make is made with time and care to make sure the customers love the food. Tacos, burritos, & rice bowls are amazing too.<//Review>

I've been here quite a few times. The staff is always friendly and willing to help you choose something if you're undecided. My go to items off the menu is the aioli burger and the wings. The aioli burger is not your typical burger...I would say it's more like a gourmet burger you can get at those higher end places. Trust me just try it! The wings are so good. They make it with some secret sauce that I can't describe. But its really good. I usually get a dozen wings with my burger.< /Text>

Toro Grillhouse is my favorite grill. My favorite items are the tacos; particularly the Pastor tacos. Yet, they are beyond tacos, they also have burgers, wings and Filipino dishes. The Wings of Wallstreet are a close second; these have a great balance of sweet and salty and have that Asian flare. The staff is very prompt and friendly, and I can order online and collect customer points.</review>

Toro is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. It's a walk up counter and naturally a person will think that there is nothing special going on here but the food is truly excellent. I love the Garlic Fries or as that call them "OMG Fries" and the aioli burger is excellent. It's my standard go to but the other dishes are also excellent.</text>

<Text>I had no idea that toro was a different name for amazing sandwich this place is a good american mexican food place. the food taste authentic and the concepts and creation of foods is what bring the americanize side out. i had a tor sandwich with carna asada , the meat was full of flavor and i didn't think you could add salsa to a sandwich but i did and it just enhanced the flavors even more. this food is really good and every dish is made to order<//Text>< pics>

Easily my favorite "Mom and Pop," non-chain restaurant in the city. Great thing about this place is the VARIETY! Tacos, burgers, rice bowls, and more. Depending on what I'm in the mood for, there always something that I can find there. People tend to recommend the Aioli burger, which is well-deserved. It's literally a gourmet burger at a "Mom and Pop" price -- and it tastes great! But for my money, the best thing on the menu is the All Day Breakfast Burrito. So, so good. Other things I like: Wings of Wall Street. Carnitas Burrito. Carne asada fries.

The staff and owner are super cool people, too. Next time you drop in, ask for RJ. He'll make sure you have a good experience!<//text>

My girlfriend and I ordered the california burrito and a wet burrito. The wet burrito didn't come with the melted cheese on top or salsa that i t was suppose to come with. The california burrito had 3 hard bone like things in it and the flavor was very smokey, as if only drenched in chipotle tabasco hot sauce. Both were below par in flavor, quality, price and size. I do not recommend this place or understand what the hype was all about. We found this place on yelp and it had great reviews but we were very disappointed.<//Text>

Always great food, always great staff. I wish I could eat here everyday. I may be addicted to the aioli burger, Toro Fries, Wings of Wall Street and the 3 meat breakfast burrito. I'm also a huge fan of the Bullseye Burger. I pretty much alternate between the Aioli and Bullseye and get everything else. Edit: The California Burrito is BOMB too!< /review>

<review>Went to buy a tool and asked about return policy, wasn't sure if would fit. Got accused of wanting to use and return. Guy refused to sell me the item and just went to O'Reilly. A much better experience. I advise others to avoid this store. The entrance is out of the way and the customer service was also lacking.</review>< Pics>

<user>113208099091293222721< /user><Review>Fast paced and usually got at least the part your looking for and the guys at the counter can usually answer the questions that your looking for. Best about this place to my latest knowledge is that is you need t replace something small on the spot they have a few tools that you can use while your still their at their location. That's a win for any unsuspecting obstacles the road might throw at you.

Thanks AutoZone Auto Parts.

I do hope that this helps you along your way and I send my best wishes.
Have a good one, bye.< /Review>< Rate>

I've been going to auto zone and other auto stores in Town for 25 years and its always been pretty much "whoever has the cheapest part gets the business". But recently I went to auto zone at 5 minutes till close and the doors were locked and I was in the middle of a repair that I could have finished if I had the right tool. The employee that saw me ignored me, and when I called, they didn't answer. So I called the  number on the door for the district mngr and he answered at home! He made the situation right by not only giving me my tool for free, but gave me a $20 gift card as well. 9pm is pm, not 8:55 and that employee left me with no car for a whole day with that choice. Kudos to management for making it right. Kept my business.<//text>

<Text>Make sure to return goods within a month of purchase because in as much as the receipt says they will give you a refund if you return goods within 90 days, apparently that is not always the case and for some goods they won't allow you to return them after 30 days have lapsed so be careful with that time frame and don't follow what your receipt says</Text>< pics>

They always have what im after. Their prices are great. They've only let me down once....... well cause they were closed. Ok the nap before the store was a bad idea, but I bet they would have stayed open dew more minutes if I would have called. Hey listen if you need a monkey wrench they will find the monkey that owns one and steal it from him< /Review>

AutoZone Manteca, CA helped me out a ton. I had a battery that needed to be replaced and I couldn't turn off the car, or else I'd never get it started again. Isaac got me the battery quickly and I was able to get it switched up right there and on my way. Excellent customer service, even in difficult times 👍<//review>

<Text>The kid that was helping us was great there was a line and the phone was ringing he was handling all of it. The manager on duty though was not helping anyone and was perfectly content to let the kid do everything . It was close to closing and he wouldn't  answer phone or cash out customers...wow talk about a disappointing example of leadership ..</Text>< pics>

<review>My experience was straight forward, just needed a headlamp, but I was impressed with the patience the employee showed with a customer that kept asking questions that had no answer to his liking and kept telling the employee how six months ago, the parts he was looking for were in stock and cheaper.
Been here twice and both times was helped in reasonable time and with a smile.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Just got off the phone with an employee named Brandon. I have very little knowledge about cars and auto repair but he quoted me on needed parts and provided valuable information and suggestions. Brandon's knowledge and customer service are very much appreciated. I Intended on calling around to compare prices but I feel that is no longer necessary as I will be going in to this location to purchase the parts in result of such a great customer experience so far.< /review>

The shop I take it to get oil changes at never mentioned the battery to me so I was unaware that it was beyond bad, it was swollen and corroded the connections. The people at this eurozone helped me get it fixed up and got my car running again. I'm very thankful for them!</text>< username>

<user_name>Derek Lackey<//user_name>< Review>
On Sunday at 1:30 in the afternoon I came in to grab two small items. There were a few customers in the store, but they were in no way slammed. I stood in line behind a customer, but when I was up to pay the sales associate left the counter without saying anything to me. She went on to help a different customer find a part. I figured that he must have been there before me. I continued to wait. At this point I still had not even been acknowledged by the sales staff. I know that I had been seen by the three staff members working, but not one even said "hey. We'll be right with you. After fifteen minutes of standing there, watching customers walk straight in the door and immediately get help I decided that I would rather spend my money at an establishment that understands how to provide customer service to all customers.<//Review>

And even humorous when I go in asking for certain things, and get more of an "impressive😮"  nod, rather than  a "what do you know about fixing that 😒..." Look. Lol. They'll even down sale you to save you a couple bucks if they have a deal goin on. Only negative- the wait can be long if the employee:customer ratio is off.

<review>Staff doesn't know squat and relies all on a computer to tell them anything. Most parts I buy are incorrect and I end up having to look up part numbers on Google myself, then go back and TELL them what I need. Pointless to have a staff if they know nothing about cars or trucks at all amd can't find the right parts. On the up side, if you already know what you need, they at least often times have it in stock or can get it fast.<//review>< Response>

They acted as if they were annoyed by customers asking questions. They were very rude to a lady who asked where they were keeping wheel covers. Their answer: " look in the back over there" one guy was typing stuff in the computer the other one reading a magazine. Never going back again.< /text>

Worst customer service I’ve experienced. They have 0 trust or respect for their customers. I bought 3 NOS tubes from them and 1 of them arrived not functioning. I returned them for a warranty, I called ahead and got a return code and shipped them in the tube box they came in. They called and told me that they couldn’t accept them since they couldn’t confirm that I bought them from upscale audio. Now I’m out hundreds of dollars. Never buying from them again. Did they seriously think that I somehow found other matching tubes and boxes and tried to scam them? Ridiculous.</text>

Excellent buying experience!  Tamara was very helpful in finalizing the transaction and following up with freight delivery research!  My purchase of Martin Logan Montis arrived unharmed, even though speakers had to travel by freight almost across entire USA (2200 miles).<//text>

<text>Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the recent comments.  I have had two separate orders in the last year or so that both had issues and the customer service was very poor.  In the most recent case there was a very easy correction to an order that I needed and after multiple emails and back and forth over a  2-3 week period the order ended up routed back to Upscale and cancelled.  It was not a huge $ amount...maybe $1500 but still when you are publicly saying over and over again that you strive for the best customer service in the industry.....something isn't lining up here.</text>< pictures>

That is not our fault.  We called it back Thursday, which means I ended up paying the air shipping charges, return air shipping charges, and a fee for returning it.  You stated you needed KT150\'s by the weekend.  We e-mailed you, and Josh called your number twice on  Feb 12.  You did not call back. I have screenshots of all of this.  In fact, I have called you back too.  While this is happening we have commitments to other customers, and as you may recall a snowstorm and freezeout created havoc for all our customers across 2/3rds of the country.\n\nYou may have sent a note saying you ordered the wrong tubes before it was packed but I don\'t know where it is or if it would have been read in time to stop shipment.

<text>My feeling about Upscale is that they have gotten too big to properly service their customers and that at this point I would recommend to people that they try a smaller shop that can provide a better experience. There's a point in every successful company where they grow to the point where they may act like they are doing you a favor by selling you something. It's a pitfall that occurs in many industries, retail being the most susceptible, high end audio especially. This drives me crazy and if it drive you crazy too, shop somewhere else. There are so many other local and online option to give your business to.< /text><pics>None</pics>< username>

Our reviews from customers show increasing satisfaction, with 4.87 stars in over 7800 reviews.  https://www.reviews.io/company-reviews/store/upscale-audio\n\nI am very proud of what we do on a daily basis, especially since our business went up 45% in 2020.  Covid has caused huge demands and at the same time massive product shortages.   I'm trying like hell to get more staff, even using videos and full-page ads in magazines.  Every dealer and every manufacturer has been pushed to the limit this last year, and one reason we have been so busy is I'm the only dealer that held massive inventory.\n\nBut there are physical limits, and we have to be real.  My employees are beat tired. They are not machines, and neither am I.  Right now I have a shipment of Tannoy sitting on a ship for 3 weeks because it can't come in and unload.  UPS literally shut down some shipments of products coming in to ship vaccine.  All I do daily is try to get goods.\n\nI have no problem with people going to local dealers.  I sell to those dealers, and want them to stay around.  As to Upscale Audio, I hire the best people in the industry and create an atmosphere where they can be honest with customers.  All my employees make more money than the places they came from, but  they are not compensated by selling anybody anything.  Which is how I want it.  And based on our repeat business continuing to grow, it works."}</Response></record>

Terrible experience.  I noticed their site has all these great reviews but these are only after a successful transaction.  I write this because I can only review here on Google because my order was a huge fail.

I ordered a product that was shown in stock.  Due to Coivd19 I was patient and waited for two weeks..  but after no communication for two weeks and no product, I emailed them.  Then I find out product was not in stock but good news they are getting some in a few days and one of those is mine.  If I didn't get a shipping confirmation I was told to email them again (why am I emailing them and not them me?).  Well as you can guess no shipping label and over a period of a week still no shipment.  I did email customer service during this time but he was not working so understandably I did not get a response from him.  This still should not have delayed me getting the product shipped to me over that week.

I like to support individual companies but if I had ordered on Amazon I would have had it in less than a week.  Sadly after three weeks I canceled and ordered elsewhere.  Very frustrated and will not do business with them again.

{'time': 1614625913507, 'text': "Hey Matt - I'm sorry you could not get that phono stage.  I would have been most happy to have you get it elsewhere.  As you know Vincent is imported my Audio Advisor and they didn't have it either.  It has been a chronic problem with them that they don't order deep enough, and it's been that way for years.\n\nThe product outages from all brands are so pervasive I recently hired one employee whose sole purpose is to handle backorders and notify customers.  We often cannot get ETA's from manufacturers, because their employees are working remotely like mine are, and they don't even know sometimes.\n\nYou are right.  Covid is a nightmare for every HiFi dealer in the world because of shortages and business has blown up for everyone.  I'm glad people are listening to music instead of watching the news, but January 2021 is 81% busier than January 2020.  Klipsch was up 100% in 2020.  While that sounds attractive, it is not.  Every factory, distributor, retail store employee, and FedEx driver is pushed beyond their limits.  Our problem is not that our company has grown too much, it's that I can't get enough employees.  I've placed full-page ads in Stereophile and TAS for help wanted.  And when I do get them I can't bring them in the building to train because I'm in California and not essential.   And I have had employees get Covid, including myself.\n\nIt's a nightmare and I know at the end of the day we are supposed to be the fun place.\n\nSo I can assure you we're trying our best, but we'll never be perfect.  So sorry we didn't get you taken care of better.\n\nCheers\n\nKevin Deal"}</resp>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I can spot them a mile away !! I have had the fortune of dealing with them most of my life.  These relics from a bygone era , passionate individuals who take their businesses seriously and posses a wealth of wisdom not seen anymore with the younger business owners of the current generations.
Those of us lucky to endeavor in hi-fi audio and it’s products should protect and appreciate these dinosaurs, once they are gone  we can only hope they did enough to pass it down to the survivors, that is, if they can manage to survive these pandemic riddled times.
My experience with Kevin Deal and Upscale Audio is like many shared in the different media outlets. I’ve been watching their videos and bought tubes occasionally over the years.  After watching one of his latest video reviews of an excellent integrated tube amp, I reached out with my specs and asked him for an opinion on how the amp would match with the rest of my setup.  He quickly pointed out that I had a decent solid state setup and I told him I built it from his reviews and past opinions, but had acquired it used and new from different sources not from upscale audio, he was not pleased about this, rude? perhaps, best customer service attitude? probably not , but he was right in pointing this out as a “problem “. Over a period of three weeks after our conversation, he matched the aforementioned amp with the same speakers I have in his studio, he also went up the line and tried different more expensive amps from the same company and compared them with a much cheaper PrimaLuna Evo 400, added Kat to the evaluation and provided his and her opinion on how they would sound with my setup. He left the decision up to me even though I clearly was leaning to the more expensive amp, (10k more!!).
I purchased the Evo 400 , still being broken in and I am floored by the sound from this little giant!! Unreal !! ..and it’s only going to get better, WOW!
There’s a few negative reviews about Kevin and his personality, as I pointed out, he is from a different era but his commitment to his passion is impeccable, complaining about him is like complaining that TRex had to go because it was too heavy and loud, check your ego at the door , appreciate that there’s less and less of them out there, truly listen to what his giving you and more importantly, support and buy from his business, pray that he is passing his craft down and hope Upscale Audio is around to service our endless efforts to achieve the impossible, bring the live performance home to our subjective ears...I know I will buy from his business without hesitation..and thank you Sir, many years of health to you .</Text>< gmapID>

Period. I’ve had a few snags with some of the gear I’ve gotten over the years— but despite it being manufacture-related, every step of the way Kat was 100% on my side making sure it got solved. She’s always been fully committed to making sure I ended up in-love with my stuff. To my friends I refer to her as  “My Dealer” — which if you’re reading the reviews of a high-end audio store, you can relate. Kat actually started me down this road with my first real set up and our relationship has just gotten better and more personalized over time. She knows all my components and has helped me slowly build the system of my dreams. She is an expert but totally unpretentious. Low-key but dialed in. Never forces her opinions but isn’t shy with them. Never upsells (I think she’s smart enough to know gear heads upsell themselves.) Most importantly she’s kind and loves music. Everyone I’ve chanced to meet at Upscale has been lovely, and they carry top of the line product— but it’s Kat that will keep me coming back. She goes above and beyond. Last thing I’ll say, is that she completely understands the passion and occasional psychosis that this hobby can incur. Example: I had a little slip and miscue on a record and couldn’t get it out of my head that I might have bent or damaged the stylus. I sent pics and implored her to tell me everything was fine. Which she did. But she also added a little addendum which was that: a lot of the time, we can get in our own heads about our gear, but if we can find a way to relax and just focus on the music, we’ll get the most out of the experience. If you’re like me, and you almost certainly are if you’re still reading this, that bit of wisdom will mean something to you. Thanks, Kat. For all that you do. I’ll be back, but you knew that already.< /review>< pictures>

Great Experience

Kevin has great videos on You Tube that were very helpful to me in learning about the products. Mike was also very patient and helpful in answering my questions and helping me decide on a Primaluna tube amp. Mike and Jenny worked to ensure my order was shipped correctly and on time. A+ execution from start to finish! My amp will be here tomorrow, can't wait! Upscale Audio will be my go to from now on.< /Text>

Bought my sbooster linear power supply from here which was great. These guys are pros with good customer service. My dac broke and I had no need for the sbooster anymore (no 12v audio products) and they accepted it as a return without question. To me this is a sign of good customer service. The whole time I dealt with them it always seemed to be their goal to make their customer happy and for that I write this review.</Review>

I messaged Upscale about purchasing a preamp and was pleasantly surprised when Kevin himself gave me a call back. He was very receptive on the phone and provided some excellent insight as to what would net me the best return for my money. Calling truly is the best way to get great advice and great pricing and that is exactly what I got here. My order was shipped out the same day, tracked and insured, and *triple* boxed (to be fair I think PS Audio double boxes, but it was carefully boxed yet again by Upscale). Everything came in on-time, as promised, and sounds amazing. I will continue working with Upscale since the experience was truly first class. I cannot recommend them enough.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Excellent and knowledgeable staff. Everyone was very friendly and did an terrific job answering all my questions and making sure I had all the right matching components. They have extensive catalogs of rare equipment should the need arise, but everything I needed, they had available in stock. Thanks upscale!<//text>

Out standing experience dealing with Kevin and his staff. They are very professional, knowledgeable, patient and informative. His store is beautiful. The product lines he carries are over achievers. I am from Seattle area and flew into Orange county for another reason. I called Kevin to see if he could be available. The only time I could visit the store was on a Saturday. Although normally closed Kevin was happy open his store for me. We spent at least 3 hours answering questions asking questions listening to equipment.  A truly great experience< /text>

As always, Kevin and his team of very knowledgeable audiophiles steered me in the right direction for my system and my desired effect within my budget. They are the first to steer you away from something that isn't right for your system... contrary to the agenda of most sales people. I think of them more like audio system specialists and advisors rather than sales people. They are not paid on commission so the incentive to force a sale is not their. Thus you have a low pressure environment. They are my go to equipment supplier for all my audio needs.</text>

I have to say that Kevin gave me the best deal i could have wished for. Never in all my years of purchasing Stereo equipment have i had someone probably loose money on a trade in/ purchase. He was so wonderful i sent him two jars of Honey from my Bee Hive. He went over and above what he should have done.< /review>

I had a really positive experience both times I’ve dealt with these folks.  The digital streamer I got from them died about a week after I got it, but UA was very helpful getting the issue resolved and a new unit on the way.  The second streamer works and sounds great.

The second item I got from them was a JL audio powered sub.  Kevin, the man himself, was on the phone with me for ~10 minutes discussing it.  This is all for a $1500 sub...not a $30k pair of floor standers.

I can’t confirm or deny other people’s experiences here, but mine was a positive one.

Thanks</Review>

OK, I have known Kevin for over 15 years and I can tell you that he only has one ambition in his life. And that is to get all of us dummies to enjoy the best possible sound at the lowest possible price. Tubes rule and the best amps don't cost anywhere near a hundred grand. Got it? Good.<//review>

Every visit has always been great, from the old school days of Kevin mainly working the Demo room at his home to the new Retail showroom with their Superhelpful Salesperson Kat. Anytime you have any technical questions, Jarred is always very helpful. If they can’t figure it out over the phone, they invite you to bring it down. So if you are interested in something Upscale has to offer, don't hesitate, give them a call and find out for yourself! World Class Service here.

I have made many purchases over the years and learned an incredible amount about analog gear (and a few things about digital although it's not my preference).  I have also recommended many friends and they have all been very happy with their purchases.  Occasionally when I call or stop by things are very busy but I have never had anyone be rude.  I highly recommend Kevin and his crew and am excited to see their new store.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Not at all impressed. I met Kevin at a Hi-Fi show and felt that he's more of a salesman than audiophile. There's to much snobbery and snake oil there and not enough solid engineering knowledge. They frequently describe equipment with non engineering emotional words such as "warm" "full" "deep" "solid" knowing little of established scientific wording like "slew rate" "phase distortion" and such. One would think they are judging a fine wine rather than a piece of audio equipment. I've been into Hi-Fi for over 50 years and started designing and building tube and solid state equipment over 40 years ago. I've never once seen in any engineering book this non technical emotional subjective gibberish.</Review>< userid>

I just received my VPI Classic 4, Sound-Smith MIMC Star and Manley Chinook SE.  All arrived safe and sound and exactly on time thanks to Upscale's obsessive packing!

The equipment matches beautifully and sounds amazing!!

My overall experience with Upscale was outstanding.  Kat was joy to work with - and as you promised treated my new turntable as if it were her own.  She is a keeper: professional, passionate, knowledgeable and nice!

The equipment is awesome and the deal you cut me was jaw dropping!

I don't know why anyone would buy high end audio equipment from anyone else! These guys are the best!!!  I just wish they were closer!  I will definitely buy from them again!

Providing auditions for one-off items that aren't current production models is a costly endeavor that would result in us having to charge more for the products we sell. We have a huge warehouse and we can't clear the isles and get the forklift to bring down a used item each time someone wants to have a listen. Our customers like our low prices and I imagine our low price on the item you were interested in was something that brought you to our store in the first place. As mentioned, we do have a return policy to protect you in the case something doesn't work. Sorry we couldn't help you out this time. I'm not sure how we could have met you halfway."}< /Response>

Recently purchased an integrated amplifier, only to receive a call two days later from the owner Kevin who stated that it had long been sold from inventory. The description in the listing stated one serial number while the one pictured on the back of the unit was clearly different. It was also contradictory stating something to the effect of "one visible scratch on the face plate, hard to photograph but they're there". Their website mentions that the price of their used gear is negotiable. A wholly unpleasant conversation with Jared revealed this was incorrect and was not mentioned anywhere on their site, as were his words. I only warrant the second star in this review because my refund was very quick. Jared and Kevin are incredibly rude and arrogant, with nothing to be arrogant about considering their total disregard for customer service, knowledge of their own terms and products as advertised, or current inventory. Avoid this sham of an operation at all costs!</text>

LOVEDDDD IT.
It was my first time ever going to a winery and I left with lots of information. Ryan seems very passionate about his job and is very detailed with answering the questions I had. I had a very deep connection since I visited with my best friend of 13 years. Loved every second of it ❤< /Review>

<review>My wife and I come here every quarter to pick up our shipment in person and truly enjoyed every single time we visited. We signed for 4 bottle membership about 4 years ago and never regretted. Great wine, amazing staff, cozy place and our beloved CJ who's the warmest and kindest person in the world (besides being an absolute wine expert!). Love this winery and will be coming  back many more times!< /review>< pictures>

We had a wonderful tasting at Judd Hill Winery. The staff was informative and gracious. We tasted very good wines. It was a fantastic introduction to Napa Valley wines for our visitors from Texas. They enjoyed the wines and especially all the information about grape growing and wine making. It was the best.</Text>

< review>
Great wineries! It was a blast to come over for their wine tasting!
We were introduced about how the wines were made, the fire, and the contacts the winery made with the farmers. Such a great amount of knowledge!
The wines here were extremely good. The Chardonnay and the white wines were pretty standard, with some of the mixing ones standing out as having a great ore&after taste. The ones I like the most were the 2011 mix, as it gave a little bit of bitterness initially, but it went away quickly to leave on the fruit flavors. The popular rose was fine, but a little sour and not outstanding for me.
The estate was fantastic. It was definitely a very good made with little taste of alcohol, but yet you can tell the wine was deep and strong. The fruit ness of the grape mixed really well with everything else, giving you a great aroma as well as the richness of the grape - simply a condensed feeling.
We had a fun blind tasting event suggested by the staff. We enjoyed it a lot and were offered with some sweet wines later on! Their sweet wine was on point, not as sweet as the ice wines I had in Canada so I bought two back.
Fantastic experience in a great yard. Love it a lot!</review>

We really enjoyed Judd’s Hill and mainly because of Todd! Todd has a wealth of knowledge about wines, Napa, and everything else. We learned so much from him and enjoyed every bit of it. He had great recommendations too about wine and Napa in general. Todd simply made our wine tasting A++ at Judd’s Hill.<//Text>

I found Judd's Hill on a search for vegan wine tasting in Napa.  I have never done a wine tasting before and don't know much about wine.  I took my husband and parents with me and we had a great time.  Michael went above and beyond bringing out wines not on the menu and had so much interesting information about the process and flavors.  I highly recommend Judd's Hill.  Beautiful outside patio surrounded by grapes.  I think joining the wine club may be happening soon. 10 stars ☆< /review>

One of our favorite wineries!  They had the tasting set up for us on their patio.  Their views are fantastic and their red wines are great.  CJ hosted us and was very approachable.  We loved the laid back atmosphere and knowledgeable host!  Thanks for a great tasting!< /Review>

<review>Decided to check out Judd's Hill Winery as first stop on a wine tasting adventure. It was a very hot day in Napa so we were very pleased with the AC. Mike took care of us and gave us a great deal of history regarding the winery, some wine gadgets, and the wines we were tasting. I went with the reserve tasting and thoroughly enjoyed each one. The wines were so nice  that I even joined their club. While the tasting took a bit longer than we had anticipated (approx. 1.5 hr), on the way home at the end of the day, our whole crew of six agreed that Judd's Hill was the highlight of the day.
Thanks Mike!</review><username>Michael Scholz</username></record></dataset><record>

My husband and I found Judd's Hill because of a positive review online 3 years ago and are so glad we did. Judd's Hill is relaxed, beautiful, not pretentious, and makes delicious wine. It's a small, local place with a chill-yet-high-end atmosphere. Make sure you get Todd as your wine educator! He always has us laughing and explains so much about the wine industry/Judd's Hill/the specific bottle we're trying. Seriously just a perfect Napa experience.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtM4Jg7fZZb81E4JUOHkOFIqFUfwnjV3GpST5t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808506ba36069ef1:0x872c89de33e28e2c</gmapID></record>

We did a 2 hour wine blending class here with Todd and had an awesome experience! We learned all about the wine making, blending, and bottling process, tasting wine from the barrel throughout our time there. In the end, we took home 4 bottles of our crafted blend complete with a custom label and got to taste their reserve wines as well. Todd was knowledgeable, friendly and funny and he made our experience great. Would highly recommend for anyone looking to learn more about the winemaking process or looking to taste good quality wines with great hosts!< /Review>

Our experience with our wine expert Todd was second to none. The wine was great, the atmosphere was beautiful, and the Judd Hill team couldn't have been more welcoming and knowledgeable.< /text>

< Review>
I first visited this winery about 7 years ago with friends who were members. I recently went back for a wine/food pairing class I purchased on groupon. The woman who teaches the class is C.J., she is phenomenal!   I was impressed with her knowledge and hospitality so I joined the winery. I have been to the release party which was so enjoyable. The wine maker Judd is often on the premises when ever I go for tastings
( which is a couple times a month) . He is friendly and welcoming as well. The wines are delicious too! This is a great place to take a picnic lunch and relax with wine at one of the cozy tables.<//Review>

Todd gave us great information about the wines and history etc, yes you would expect that, but don't always get it. He also gave advice for other places to visit and where to eat.  I would recommend this as a starting place for you tour of the valley. I think recommendations are advisable, we did turn up on a quite day and were welcomed and treated very well without a reservation.</review>< Pics>

<UserId.>110318199356728921439< /UserId.><review>This was our fourth stop of a small tour, 5 couples. My wife and I decided to try the reserve tasting and our palettes were delighted. Though with a group, we were able to taste at our leisure, giving us suitable time to ensure our senses accurately obtained a true sense of the wine.

Our hostess, CJ, shared her incredible knowledge and dry humor. We had 5 or 6 different pours, but we memorably enjoyed 2 separate and well structured meritages and a delicious merlot. It was a near automatic decision to join their wine club!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Very very nice folks!  Mike was very sweet to us and explained to us how it worked (we were new and just passing through Napa Valley to check it out) and we learned so much about wine the process Napa Valley and a lot in between would definitely make sure you add this place to your list.</Text>

My husband and I came here tasting before once and decided to come back and try the wine blending because the wines were really good and they grow and source some of the highest quality grapes in the valley.  Excellent time!  Todd was great, the grounds are lovely, and the blending was fun and educational.

It was great being part of the entire process from blending different mixes, to drawing out the wine from the barrels, corking (with real corks), foiling and labeling.  The labeling only allows for text, and features the Judd's Hill logo at the top but we are very happy with the labels!  Can't wait to see how our blend ages.  The components are Rutherford Merlot, Napa Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot.  We've been to Napa over a dozen times and this was our first blending - highly recommended!!!  Can't recommend Todd our wine educator highly enough, either!  Quite a gem of a place.< /review>

For my husbands 30th birthday trip he chose Napa Valley and invited his parents along. Our first day we arrived and stopped for lunch at the Kitchen Door where we first tasted "Magic" Judd Hill on tap. I was so intrigued by the wine I immediately booked a tasting at the Judd Hill Winery. This was our first Napa wine tasting and it did not disappoint. CJ was incredible, she is very knowledgeable and has a wonderful sense of humor. We laughed our entire tasting she made us feel so at home. We also met Judd who was so nice and welcoming. We left completely satisfied and with a membership of course! I loved every red we tasted at JH, we had another winery tasting later that day and although their tasting was wonderful in its own right their wine did not compare to Judd Hill. I highly recommend a visit. I hope we find ourselves back in Napa at Judd Hills but in the meantime we will enjoy our JH at home. Thanks for making our visit special and unforgettable!< /text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Great food!!!! I’ve had their food from this location a few times, and it’s been tasty and fresh every time! Curbside pickup is a nice feature here, but the parking in this lot sucks because of the traffic coming and going right in front of their spaces. Their food portions are a good size, so if you’re going hungry you won’t leave that way! Can’t wait to get to dine in person here, so we can try some other menu items along with enjoying an adult
beverage with a meal. They also seem to have some decent looking desserts as well!!!</review><Date>1612590641963< /Date>< name>

<review>Pros: delicious albacore sandwich, 1/2 + 1/2 sides option, friendly and attentive staff, comfortable seating, relaxing ambiance (weekdays), outdoor patio.

Cons: tables and light fixtures can be cleaner.

Bottom line: great fast food restaurant.</review>< Pics>

Cashier experience wise good greetings are really good and suggestions not much for toppings.i ordered  hook burger classic with grilled onions and regular fries and rootbeer. My order done taking at around 2 pm and my food came at 2:12 something like that and I take a bit on my burgers and its not hot 😔🍔 but its really good I mean worth it for waiting.for someone like me who likes burgers and fries.i will definitely back again...see you hook burger

Thanks.

Update: I was in today, ordered mushroom on my burger. They charge extra for that. I paid. When I got back to the office and started eating my burger, came to find that the mushrooms were not on the burger. I called in and was transferred to Rubin- the manager. He said he would have a coupon in the value of $7 under my name for the next visit. Super happy with their resolution tactics! Thanks Rubin!

I placed an online order. It was ready on time, but I showed up 10 minutes late. Justina was kind enough to offer refreshed onion rings so that I wouldn't have to eat stale ones. Just that small kind gesture will definitely make me a return customer! Thanks Justina!< /text>

Good ambiance but pricey. Its a burger, the price premium must be because the.facilties let you know you are not in a fast food.joint...nice place to chill too and has outdoor seating. Sweet potato fries are delish and they have beer.< /Text>

<review>Solid 4 definitely a go to spot when I want burgers and dessert because of the location, it's near a lot of options.. the burgers they have range from mild to wild with the meat selections or the full custom burgers you can built on your one with so many ingredients...I usually get the original and my gf has the adventurous side, the homemade sodas are good< /review>< Pics>

One of the best burgers in town, nice and delicious. I personally love the California burger comes with avocado and price is 8.25$
They also offer beer and wine
Salads are good too.
Variety of sauces available on each table.
Friendly staff in combination with their great food make this place real heaven.<//text>

<review>I'm not usually a fan of caramelized onions, but I decided to go all in when checking out Hook Burger, and I'm glad I did! The California burger had a great balance of meat, bun, and toppings, and the caramelized onions definitely added to the great flavor. The French fries were a little lacking, being too soft for my liking, as well as a weak flavor profile. The Oreo milkshake was decent. They serve it with a straw and spoon because it's so thick.<//review></record></dataset><record>

This place is awesome! Even at peak dinner hours there is always room to sit down and eat. Their go to burger, the Hook Burger, is actually very well priced considering its size and preparation. You could easily pay an extra $5 for this at a fancier place.
Another notable mention is the small brand fountain sodas they have available with real sugar. Try them out, I especially enjoyed the ginger ale.<//review>

Highly recommend the asian chicken salad, the California burger, the kids meals if you have kids, their lemonade! Fast, quick, efficient service. The food is always on point. Its a pay and go type of service style, there are no waiters but they alway make sure you have what you need when they bring you food. Extremely affordable.< /Review>

They've got good ingredients so the burgers are way fresher and cleaner tasting then most burger joints. Bonus that it's right across from the Westfield so if you ever want a burger while you're at the mall this place is perfect for it.<//Text>< Name>

<review>First visit to Hook. A friend asked me to pick up some food there. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. Prices were reasonable, and a good variety of burgers and assorted dressed up fries, onion rings, and drinks etc...offered. The food was prepared quickly.  I like having another quality fast food/restaurant to go to for good food in the Woodland Hills area.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< user_id>

<Text>Interior looks really cool and comfy. Place is not really clean - I noticed some dirt under few tables that was there for hours I believe.
I ordered California burger, sweet fries and a drink.
Burger price is ok but they charge a fortune for fries (3.59) and a fountain drink  (2.85)
Burger itself looks cool but the taste is not there. Their patty is not juicy at all and has 0 flavor. Literally.
I am not sure if I was eating a meat at all
Super weird
Not my place to go<//Text>< gmap_id>

I prefer the beef to be the primary ingredient and flavor of the hamburger. Specific to the 3 hamburgers we ate it seems that the topings were the primary flavors and the beef flavor was lost.  The basic hamburger; lettuce, tomato and cheese, the meat was dry and without flavor. Sad to say, this is just another average "Burger" under $10.00.<//review>

From the exterior to the food quality it was exactly what I was in the mood for and wanted. I think a restaurant has good design and atmosphere when you can get e feel for the food inside purely by looking at the aesthetic. My burger was delicious too.</review>

Hook Burger never disappoints!  Try the Pretzel Burger.  No longer on the menu, but still available.  Great fries and delicious onion rings.  Staff is always friendly and very efficient.  Love this place!</Text>

I love Hook Burger. It doesn't matter which one I go to. There's consistent quality and delicious flavors at every location. This place has a nice seating area outside that is very relaxed. Perfect for a hot summer day. I usually get the hickory burger and sweet potato fries. Not at all what I'd refer to as healthy, but it certainly is tasty and filling. It's worth mentioning they do have salads as well, if you want something lighter. The people who work here are total sweethearts too. You should definitely give it a try if you're looking for a new favorite burger place.< /review>

The best burger pound for pound. The hickory burger with blue cheese is my favorite. I also love their shakes and onion rings. The chicken club sandwich and salads are also great options. Not a bad thing to say about this place other than I wish they had more locations.< /text>

So the food was delicious but that's not why I loved it. I have a tradition of building giant towers out of fries and somehow convincing people to eat them in one giant bite without their hands. This results in some hilarious bird like movements. So I built one here and I convinced two different people to play a game of "What are the odds?", Loser has to eat the tower. My friend Thunder was the glorious loser, and Thunder is a big dude. The tower was at least six inches tall and my man places his hands flat on the table and I swear he unhinged his mouth like a snake and inhaled the whole tower in one Swift bite. I'm still laughing about it too this day. So you could say I have some pretty special memories here... And the food was, in fact, delicious. Would recommend.<//Review>

Our first time here, but so glad we decided to get a quick lunch while we had our car serviced.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The menu was surprisingly diverse and the food was excellent!  We had the Grilled Albacore and Turkey Burger.  The vibe was casual and comfortable, but sit outside on the patio if background noise is an issue. Definitely a place we will come back to.<//text>

I was recently turned on to Hook Burger and their wonderful menu options. Love that they serve craft beer and their milkshakes are to die for! Very clean facility with a very welcoming ambient, the staff is super friendly and attentive. Their burgers are amazing and their sandwiches...... Well you'll just have to go in and gorge on!< /text>

Not worth it

It's a decent burger. But for $9 I'm expecting something more than decent. Everything was nearly overcooked and the burger was far from juicy. The bun was slightly stale and none of the ingredients seemed very high quality. It's a small step up from most other fast food joints but falls short when comparing it to other burgers in it's price category.<//review>

I have been to many burger joints in my day, and let me tell you these are some of the best I have ever had. The quality of the meat is out of this world and the selection of fresh buns are so tasty you can eat by themselves. On top of all that they have some awesome salads if your looking for something light yet filling. Oh and did I mention they have beer and wine. Case Closed give them a shot!!</review>

<Text>Real good food, I had a mushroom burger with onion rings.
They have a wide selection of drinks, and custome lemonades.
Would get a 5, if the feel there made it unsure if you should leave a tip or not... what type of sit down environment are we in.
Anyway great food and I'll eat there again.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c29c20e3ba0a6b:0x53487cb7efa9c96e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Most times it is cooked perfectly on a Super Fresh bun and if you order the fries well-done they will actually show up that way! Crispy on the outside how to make inside, perfect! Hard to believe that the founder of Habit Burger I needed to vent hamburger place with even it higher quality and better service than the habit. Staff and servers are always helpful, and they are always walking around cleaning! Never see fat in a fast food restaurant :)<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Nice chain burger place. The menu is not very deep but all the options were well rounded, the three our party tried were made with good ingredients and executed very well. Fries were perfect and drink selection was accented with some nice non-standard options.</Review>

Love this place they never mess up a burger. Warning I get all my burgers on lettuce wasps. So that should tell all you bread lovers something. If I think their burgers are bomb on lettuce what do you think you'll think? Oh and they serve beer and have the tastiest sweet potato fries!</Text>

This is a pretty nice newer build-out.  The burgers are gourmet-light, and sit at the right price point.  They have a couple of different beer and wine options (not that expansive a list).  Onion rings and sweet potato fries are alright, but nothing to write home about.  Normal fries are okay, but usually on the salty side.  Always a reliably good meal.<//text>

Awsome burger and fries. Had the Hickory buger with Jack cheese. Great smokey flavor from the bbq sauce and the added bacon. In the mood for a good, consistent burget...this is for you.<//review>

Hook has not let me down. I love the Prime and California Burgers, and my husband loves his Turkey Burger on Wheat. The staff will make your burgers the way you want them. The place is always full and brimming with energy. It's casual and homey, and a good place to just chat and eat with the whole family. I love the Hook branch in Burbank close to 24-Hour Fitness. But this branch in Topanga is pretty good, too.</review>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>I enjoy the place, but I have to agree with the last review, quality and consistency can be an issue. The number one issue is the bun. Today the pretzel bun was cold and hard, and the bread is key for a burger. Customer service was on point, and the manager was accommodating, but they ran out of pickles. For me bread, BBQ sauce, and pickles are fundamental favorites for me.  Your can't slip on your burger when it's in the title of the store.<//Text>< pictures>

Experience was fine but the quality of the burgers and fries was lower than I remember from previous visits. My husband's burger came without cheese when I saw him specifically request it and the fries were limp and not particularly tasty.<//Review>

<text>Love the food and the service. The only problem I had was the cleanliness. It was something small but gross. The night manager was training a new girl. He was telling her how to clean up. He told her to fill up the drizzle bottles and clean the outside of the bottles with same rag they were cleaning the counters with. So all the germs from the counters will be going on all the shakes they make.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c29c20e3ba0a6b:0x53487cb7efa9c96e<//gmapID></record>

They have some of the best tasting burgers in the game, damn they are on point. There ingredients are always fresh and they cook the burger to perfection, they also have some of the most tasty selection of buns. My girlfriend loves the salads as well</text>

I am hooked on Hook Burger!  First, the hamburgers, even the buns are fresh and delicious; I would like to add that the salads are great too. Prices:  I get the Cobb Salad or the Smokehouse burger and both are under $10!   The salad fills me up as does the burger.< /Text>

The hamburgers at Hook Burger are excellent. Quality meat with just the right amount of sauce, lettuce, and extras. Also, the onion rings are thick and crispy with an incredible panko breading that is out of this world. Definitely come and eat one of their hamburgers.< /Review>

<review>Was good when opened, now just a mediocre burger place with outstandingly lousy service. For the second time, a take our order was missing items. A person at the counter looks inside the bag, reads out the order, hands you the bag, you come home and discover that 3 out of 4 items you ordered are missing. And you cannot get a refund for the missing items by calling back -- that apparently requires you to leave your phone number and wait 24 hours for "the manager" to call you back.

Nice burgers. Up-market version of McDonald's I suppose. What's all the fuss about?</Text>

I like this place. I'm also running out of go to burger spots, so my choices are thinning out lol.. but here? I always get the BBQ burger situation with no bacon with grilled chicken. Try it. It's pretty good.<//Text>

Fresh delicious food every time - great juicy burgers are the star here, but they got tasty sides too, and solid salads, tuna steak burgers, chicken sandwiches, etc. if you wanna change it up sometimes. Very consistent - honestly,  never had a bad meal here (been a couple dozen times).</Text>

I'm sure plenty of reviews rave about the burgers, and they should. But a good onion ring isn't easy. And there's are magnificent.<//Review>

Hooks gives the self entitlement a new meaning of rude very rude service. The food is well over priced. I would suggest Hamburger Habit or even
In and Out over Hooks. I would strongly suggest that Hooks retrain their staff in customer service. As far as I'm concerned I will make it a point not to recommend this place to family or friends. Word of mouth is a powerful process.</text>

Service was great and especially awesome since I had a coupon for a FReE prime burger. Tommy had the burger I have a salad to watch my figure (bbq chicken). Food delivered to our table. Good size burger and good tasting salad. Very appealing interior as its a new place especially when comparing to Fat Burger and their taped up ripped cushions. don't get me wrong I love Fat Burger but I also like to sit down without worry on my A** I would come back here again and likely will.<//review>

Wow! The food here is absolutely phenomenal! The service was fast, the staff was friendly, and the burgers were to die for. All non GMO ingredients, and environmentally friendly practices. I really appreciate this place!<//Review>

The chicken club is awesome which is why this is 4 stars. Seriously just so good as well as the onion rings. I'd def go back for that sandwich.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Hook burger had good food but loses a star for the prices.  We had the burger that had chilis and the bbq bacon burger and both of us had fries.  We split a shake.  $24.  I agree with another here that In n Out is actually probably better for the price.  But the food was pretty delicious.  And, their ranch was good too - seemed home made.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This burger place used to be awesome, but recently, the quality of the food has gone down.  The past 3 out of 4 times I've gone, the bread has been rock hard, as if toasted before the meat and allowed to harden, and the meat has been hard as well, clearly way over-cooked.  It leads to a less than satisfying burger.   Every time, it was the Pretzel Burger.

I'm not sure what's happened or change, but it has been a rapid change from great burgers to very mediocre ones.  I will give this place a break, as it simply is no longer the quality burger it was when it opened.

Whoever the owner is needs to look into it, as whoever/whatever is roasting the bread is giving out rock hard bread and whoever is now cooking the meat, is going overboard on them being well done.  When you get the same crappy burger, three out of four times, from May 2015 to September 2015, it isn't by accident.

Until this changes, I can no longer recommend Hook Burger...'tis a shame.</text>

Food is fresh, service is always fantastic and all the food seems to be local and organic. No matter how busy they look, you get to the register fast to order your food, your food comes out quickly and there always seems to have tables available.</Review>

<review>OMG this place is my new go to for craft burgers and brew. They have quality in every single item from the variety of fresh buns and even some awesome sourdough I get on occasion. My sister really enjoys the bbq chicken salad, and though I particularly am not a salad kind of person I have to agree it is one hell of a tasty salad. You really cant go wrong with any selection here. Best part Beer and WIne?<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Text>I had heard really good things but I ended up disappointed. The meat lacked flavor. I should have went to In N Out a few feet away.   It was over priced too. I paid nearly double what I would have at The Habit or In N Out. Both of them have much more flavor.<//Text>< Name>

Nice clean Restaurant. Staff was an A+ in my book...i was greeted upon entering and provided a menu to look at.

There are plenty of tables to sit at or you can sit by the ordering area on stoll chairs which are near the TVs.

The cashier was very nice and friendly.

I ordered the hickory burger with cheddar cheese. I waited about 10 minutes for my  order.

Tip: they sell beer and have a beer of the month for all of ya'll beer drinkers ...lol!

Will be back one day to try other items.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Cheap tasty and good, upgraded fast food, if you choose between it and a fast food chain the burger and fries here are better and tastier and feel fresh.

זול טעים וטוב, אוכל מהיר משודרג, אם לבחור בין זה לבין רשת מזון מהירה ההמבורגר וציפס פה יותר טובים וטעימים ומרגישים טריים.<//text>
