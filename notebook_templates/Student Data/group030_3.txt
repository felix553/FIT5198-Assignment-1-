<Review>Love their lattes! I've tried their rose latte and lavender latte thus far, and am totally hooked! Both lattes are subtly sweet, though strong in coffee flavor. Both the rose and lavender give the perfect kick without overpowering the delicious lattes. And of course, the lattes are 100% Instagram-worthy. I haven't tried their toast as I've heard they are $7-$8 each, but I'll need to sometime as I hear they're fabulous!<//Review><UserId.>109697970711706069713< /UserId.>< user_name>

The taro milk tea with sago is like a satisfying dessert.
House milk tea is a classic and very well balanced.
The jasmine milk tea is very tasty and fragrant.< /Text>

< Review>
CoCo Fresh Tea & Juice has become my new favorite spot to hang out in Los Angeles, CA. With a space for a live performance from a small band, and seats near windows that allow you to glance at the busy side streets that line Colorado Blvd, this coffee house is the perfect place to relax, either with friends or without.</Review>

<review>I do love this place.  Their teas taste great and go down smoothly.  I don't normally order or like Jasmine tea, but theirs is one of my favorites.  I love the floral flavor and it's super refreshing.</review>< Rate>

I love this location of Home! Maybe because since it's new, it's less crowded whenever I've gone (as in I can actually find a seat without fighting!). On top of that, the workers seemed to be friendlier and had thoughtful conversations with us, but maybe that's also because there aren't a million pairs of angry eyes staring at them to rush, so no shade to the other locations!< /Review>

I always order Black MilkTea or Milk tea with boba at any boba places, but this particular drink at this place is really good! Their boba is firm (not over cook) yet, chewy. Their black milktea has a real storing black tea which you don't usually get from other boba places. Overall, good quality drinks.< /Text>

Very hip cafe located on a very established street! This is has quite a different atmosphere than it's neighbors on Clement. Serving picturesque drinks and bold, statement toasts - this is a millennial's dream.<//Text>

Loved my milk tea here last week. I had mine with boba and pudding, it was really outstanding. I'd definitely recommend it. The staff were great too, everyone was very friendly.

The parking lot is a little crazy, so beware of that. It's not a problem if you're in foot though. I dropped my wife off and circled the block while she picked up our order.<//review>

Employees were sweet and helpful. Glad they had a bathroom and parking but the Boba was not very chewy and the drinks were too sweet for us. Wish they had alternative milk but understand that this chain usually doesn't. Seems more expensive then the one we have been to in Arcadia.</text>

Horrible experience. The line was far to long and it took forever to get thru. The menu they had up was just a fraction of what they offer and by the time you get up there you see a full menu and people start to change their mind about what they want. Making the wait very long. They need to post their full menu up so all can see it. Everything else was fine. But if I see a line in there I will definitely pass on it.<//review>

< Review>
After dining here with my girlfriend for a purposely planned, late Valentine's Day dinner. And having never heard of this place before making reservations, I am officially a fan of Woodlake Tavern!

To avoid the large number of people celebrating Valentine's Day on the 14th or the weekend after, my girlfriend I decided to move our celebration to two Saturday's after. And capped our day off by trying out a restaurant that we had not yet been to, but looked like it would be amazing....hence our trip to Woodlake Tavern.

I made reservations for 7, and once we arrived we were promptly seated at a table for two near the front door. It was pretty cold that day, and with patrons coming and going, I knew it would be better to be seated way from the entrance. That wasn't a problem here, and we quickly seated to  another table by the bar, for a more quiet and enjoyable night. Our waiter arrived shortly after we seated, to which we gave him our drink orders after some suggestions. And we took a little more time to look for the menu for what we wanted to eat. My girlfriend decided to get the Milagro Margarita which has grapefruit-brulee shrub, orange liqueur, and cranberry. While I chose thePurity Vodka Seasonal Mule which had fresh pomegranate seeds, pink peppercorn, cappelletti, and lime. Both versions of these classic drinks were new to us, but they both were really good.

We also decided to share an the chicken wings for an appetizer, and these wings were so delicious. They were covered in coffee bourbon bbq sauce and crispy garlic sauce, and we both were pleasantly surprised. And for our main course my girlfriend got the Shrimp & Grits, while I ordered the Steak Frites....both were AMAZING!!!

The Shrimp & Grits was served with jumbo Gulf Prawns, mixed in creamy grits, with sofrito and house cured bacon. And was  adorned with arugula to top it off. I tried a couple of bites and the seemed as if the bacon just melted in your mouth. And my Steak Frites was just out of this world. Imagine a medium rare/medium well chargrilled flatiron steak, with a demi-glace and brie butter, and served beef tallow fries. Before this night I didn't even know what beef tallow fries were, and so they cook the fries in a beef fat for a richer flavor. Those fries were hands down probably the best fries I've ever tasted. The salt just enhanced the unique flavor of the fries, that I don't know how they could have been any better. Besides the other amazing dishes, my girlfriend and I joked that we'd come back just for the fries alone!

During our evening of wonderful food, I was talking to my girlfriend about a drink that I hadn't had in years that was created locally in Davis, CA. I asked our waiter if he'd ever heard of it, to which he said he hadn't but he asked the bartender. He had and we conversed a bit and he made the drink for us, and because we'd had a good lighthearted conversation, when my girlfriend wanted to order another drink. The bartender was nice of enough to offer making her an apricot margarita that would be new to the menu for March's dinning selection. That drink too was really good. We finished the night off with the Bourbon Chocolate Parfait for dessert, which is a devils food cake, served with bourbon creme anglaise. It's very rich, so if you love chocolate then you'll love this dessert. It's might be a lot for one to have on their own because of how chocolaty it is, but sharing it was just perfect for us.

OVERALL: Love this place, it has amazing food and drinks, great atmosphere, deceptively large are I thought it was a really small place. But there's indoor and outdoor seating. So full in both you're looking at 100+ diners. Just a great experience and I look forward to going back!< /Review>

The food here is TOP NOTCH, as always, and their meats are in a league of their own. Many articles have been written about the chef and his amazing techniques, and you MUST taste to appreciate! This is a time to support independent restaurants by ordering take out. Recommend. must try</Review>

I love Taco Tuesday at the upscale Woodlake Tavern, where you can feast on their amazingly tasty, slow-cooked beef brisket tacos for just $2 each.

I've never had anything like it ... I highly recommend them! Corner of Arden & Del Paso Blvd, formerly Enotria.

This place is known for their fine comfort food meats and expert chefs (pedigrees from Ella and The Firehouse) and wine selection. The Bee just gave them a glowing review, and word is getting out about this special spot.<//review>

<review>While the staff is very polite and squared-away and the food selection is nice, it is at a shocking price-point for its location. They are located in a quirky uptown spot that would be better fit for a craft brewery than a swanky wine-inspired place. Hipsters would probably sort of like the surrounding poverty.
Another oddity is that they have a very large patio with a great deal of potential. They've put in heat lamps, a fire pit, and a nice water feature, but it's strangely devoid of the amount of flora they could have. Further, the patio shares space with the pizza joint that is owned by the same people. However, you cannot sit on the patio and order a pizza, so you can order a pizza in the pizza shop and take it to the patio. Weird.
All that said I think the Happy Hour is pretty solid. The only issues with the food was a very sad pickel. Technically I don't think it was a pickle at all, just a sliced English cucumber.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0zAKYzk38PYzJN9d-XHSDW0mnTHN8TCL2QRZq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw35UHP_C9lLguBcI_-9hfX8kAIeNnbMQxnweN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJXKvbLI7vUjEJhSxFi7S4bueuoMOj76T4uUbv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWb_jW0zYKrl35XrvTlIkfml3V9LFS4KCX62Dw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDhW9f2yOmn9gavTAtIE_4lNd5xbkctw2M8KSl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOf5qcVu0kPWnazu6o92LraZoAP-GajNPFF_YCX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

Went here for Sunday Brunch. Got there right after they opened and only 2 other tables were sat. We ordered the Eggs in Purgatory and the Brisket Hash. Highly recommend both dishes. They were fantastic. We ordered the beignets as well, which were a little underwhelming. The service was fantastic though.

Such a wonderful place.  I would recommend it highly.  The meal was incredible and the staff was wonderful.  Don't wait too long to try Woodlake Tavern.

We started our meal with an order of the Tallow Fries with a Small Salad that was put together perfectly.  We followed that with the Brisket with Mashed Potatoes and Macaroni and Cheese.  Everything was so good!.  We cannot wait until our next visit!</text>

"This is dancing food!" my husband exclaimed as he bit into the oxtail croquettes.
This diamond in the rough has a crisp,  clean,  and beautiful atmosphere. The bathroom was immaculate! There was even a clean changing room to freshen up.
Service: We were greeted by a friendly and welcoming host. We did not have a wait (not sure of normal busy hours, this was Wednesday around 7 or 8). Have you ever had a server who was not only friendly, offered excellent recommendations, and personable, but also seemed to genuinely enjoy the company of his/her guests? Michael was so friendly and welcoming to his guests (including us), that he deserves his own shoutout. I was visibly anxious (due to a really gross experience just two blocks up at a different establishment) and he didn't even bash the other business, he explained the way Sacramento is growing and said its improving. Definitely full of grace and class when he spoke with us. You're amazing! Thanks for making the experience memorable at Woodlake Tavern.
Drinks: My husband ordered a Thanksgiving specialty drink, Cranberry Sauce, Milagro Silver, Capelletti, Burly Juniper Cranberry Shrub, with Fresh Lime & Sweet Agave! Phenomenal! I finished my meal with their "Rabbit Down The Hole" cocktail. This was a very fragrant and flavorful mix,  it nails the name. There is not a better name: Gin & Amaretto mix with a honey carrot syrup,  with a sprig of thyme & a thin strip of carrot to garnish. I love savory drinks,  so if that's not your thing,  skip this and get a different specialty drink, but if you're like me or enjoy trying new drinks,  don't miss this one!
Food: We started with oxtail croquettes. White cheddar with Yukon gold potatoes and truffle aoili and chives sprinkled on top. The first bite had my husband beyond ecstatic. Hearty yet not overfilling. We ordered a Tavern Burger: beef cooked to order, covered with smoked white cheddar,  red leaf,  crispy onions, aioli,  and the most amazing savory with slight hint of sweet tomato marmalade! I can't express this enough,  it is amazing! Since I wasn't wanting such a hearty dinner,  I ordered the Impossible Burger: Vegan patty covered with crispy onions,  aioli, and that amazing flavorful tomato marmalade! There is something about that Vegan patty,  it was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth! We got salad instead of fries,  they top it with feta and your choice of dressing. Pretty good,  crisp & fresh. We shared some Macaroni & Cheese that was rich, creamy,  and crisp bread crumbs for a perfect texture that gives you that warm & gourmet home feeling.  We skipped on dessert for this time,  but, maybe next time!
Being stingy with 5 star reviews...this definitely gets 5 stars all around.< /Text>

Best bang for the buck in fine dining and cocktails in the Sacramento area. Take a little since it of downtown and enjoy a real treat.

Cocktails are approaching Red Rabbit quality, some are better. Really interesting work happening here in the kitchen and behind the bar.

Try the smoked onion rings, beet salad, heck anything!

They also have outdoor patio dining which feels private with a great atmosphere.</review>

<Text>As a wedding planner I am happy to have discovered this hidden gem. I am so happy my bride decided to get married here! The space is cozy and intimate for small events, and look forward to having more event's.

Venue:
Patio is a perfect setting for a small wedding, lounge furniture, wall waterfall feature, fire pit, covered patio.

Cater:
Food is amazing appetizers, cajun shrimp on breaded cornmeal, potatoe ships with sour creme dip was amazing.
Main Entree: Mash, chicken n pickles didn't see that tasting good,  but it was a nice pairing.

Staff: As wedding planner,  what makes the event is the exceptional service of venue.  The staff and Evan were on point and everyone was helpful and friendly.

Over The Top Events &  Parties, recommends this venue, I look forward to working with you again.<//Text>< user_name>

<Review>Closed during their normal business hours for a private party. Not the first time we went there and couldn't be seated for once reason or another. Too bad. Food is really good,  if they aren't out of a main ingredient for the menu item you wanted.  Our group of 4 who met there tonight had to find something else on the fly. Won't go out of our way to meet up there again.<//Review><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Actually, we we're in Uptown Pizza Kitchen. The food was good, service was wonderful!!
Staff was very friendly, patient, and attentive, however it was not very busy either. Despite that, I would recommend this place for the casual diner. It's a sports bar but a teeny bit more upscale. They offer patio dining that gives a you a vibe of chilling with friends and wine.</text>

<Text>I assumed it was a little as well fancy to have BARBEQUE that could be good ... the photos looked great so we offered it a shot. It was $1 rib night, however I wanted to attempt every little thing so I went with the meat sampler ... I was delighted I did ... whatever was so excellent.

I would definitely give this place a five star and I dont give those out easy..they have two bartenders and I give both of them 5 stars also..ok well if you like ribs and you think you have got a spot then just give this place
A shot because it will take its place also everything else on the menu is amazing and to top it off Thursday night is dollar rib night ....🐖🐖🐖</Review>

This might have the best smoked brisket I’ve tried. The menu is on the small side but very solid. The bar is on the small side, but the selection and quality of cocktails is spot on. This restaurant is located in kind of a weird spot, parking can be tough. Wood lake Tavern is not in Downtown or midtown, but it certainly could be. Worth checking out if you are looking for great food and supporting local< /text>

I had to get on here right away to get this review in. This place is special. We had an event here last night and the food and service were phenomenal. Everything was perfect. We spoke with the chef after and got some cooking tips. He is very knowledgeable. The Brussels sprouts in particular were fantastic. Everyone was raving about them, even people who don't normally eat them.< /text>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>So this review was in some ways difficult to write fairly. To give context, my partner and I would regularly (once every other month) visit Uptown Pizza for a couple years. Uptown pizza (same owners, shared building) is now a part of Woodlake Tavern in that some of the pizzas are served on the Woodlake Tavern menu but Uptown Pizza on it's own is closed. There were a few reasons we loved Uptown Pizza. We loved having a really amazing Pizza place near us. We LOVED the Angry Hawaiian pizza. We really liked sitting in the back with the big tree and the absolutely beautiful mural on the wall.

So to start with, as usual, the food here was and is amazing, and all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Tje servers were good and attentive and knew what they were doing. If all you care about is really good food at a decent price (and good servers and staff) then you wont be disappointed. Everything I've tried at Woodlake Tavern and Uptown Pizza has been amazing. So 5 stars if you just care about food (EXCEPT that the Angry Hawaiian is NOT on the list of regular pizzas served anymore. Apparently they may consider adding this back as a special, but that doesnt interest me as I'm not going somewhere for a special once in a while, I'm going to a restaurant because of the regularity of my favorite dish).

The reason I give 4 stars is because they have enclosed the previous outdoor space, and removed the amazing mural... the whole outdoor area is now a muted grayish green color with nothing at all special about the walls (except for a nice water feature and fireplace on one end). I would have kept the mural, and added murals to the rest of the walls to give it character.

There isn't really any good space for the outdoor games that used to be there either. And worst of all, the combination of changes makes the previous relaxing and unique outdoor space feel like a food court. And believe me though, the prices are not food court prices.

I understand these decisions were probably made to fulfill the majority of customers needs and I'm sure it all made business sense. I cant blame them for making the changes if it was a financial decision. BUT, I wont be coming back. Well, if a friend really wanted to go and invited us, I'd have no problem eating there again because the food really is great. But the aspects that really drew us back to this location are now gone unfortunately. Now we go back to the seeming neverending search for a "regular" spot that satisfies us the way Uptown Pizza used to.

Good luck, we really do wish them the best, as it's nice to have restaurants and other businesses opening up in that area, changing the neighborhood.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x809ad745a7b2a31f:0xcc76334f5612a8ca< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Woodcreek is new and improved.  The atrium area ia done and there is now plenty of outdoor seating thatis protected from the elements, but on nice days like this the roof rools back to open the area up.  When the aun started shining on us roo much they rolled it back closed.  The food was excellent.  We arrived right at 4 so we ate from the limited happy hour menu.  Thursday is dollar rib night and Saturday is $15 prime rib.  Oh we'll be back.< /review>< pics>

<Review>Had brunch with a group and it was good, not great. Service was excellent but there were a few issues with our meals. Would try it again, though, as they may be working out the kinks for their brunch. Enjoyed the ambiance - the wall fountain and live music on the patio were lovely.</Review>< Date>

My chicken was amazing (so moist and flavorful,) and the red pepper jam on top made it sing! Our friend had the brisket and it was so tender it flaked with his fork. Their BBQ sauce is excellent. We also had appetizers, my favorite being the sliders. The wings are savory-sweet and yummy but would benefit from just a little heat. The lemon and aioli on the shrimp & crab cake really makes this dish (perfect to share.) Great happy hour with delicious wines. Awesome service, Ashley is a sweetheart, and everyone is attentive without hovering. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and will return!! ❤< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Rejoice vegans (and non vegans)! They have the Impossible Burger!!! My fiance and I sat at the bar and had a blast chatting with the bartender. Everyone was very friendly. I definitely recommend this place. 👍👍< /text>

A very friendly local haunt.  Glad we found it. Attended a beer pairing dinner featuring King Kong brews (another local spot). Food was great, beer was great, service was great and the company and cast of characters at the communal table was fantastic.< /text>

Wonderful little place in an odd location. It ya soon to watch the variety of traffic go by while eating such an amazing meal. The menu is short and very solid with everything we tasted being off excellent quality. You definitely can't go wrong here.

Our service started off a little slow and the server apologized profusely for the miscommunication that led to the small delay. After that the service was perfectly attentive.

The cocktails, wine, and good were all excellent and we can't wait to go back.< /text>

I found this gem of a restaurant while searching for a quiet, cozy place to celebrate my 40th wedding anniversary and it did not disappoint!
We were greeted warmly by the maitre d' as if we were old friends and then seated immediately.  Our server Karishma was excellent -- very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  My wife was excited about the Prime Rib Single weekend special which was a good-sized portion that was delicious.  I had the Brisket Sandwich with a side salad.  Both the Sandwich and the Salad were excellent.  We also shared an order of Smoked Onion Rings which were also very tasty.  My wife loved the ranch dipping sauce while I requested something different.  Karishma suggested an aioli sauce which had just enough kick for my tastebuds.
We had to park a couple of blocks away due to an event going on nearby; however, it was a pleasant night for a stroll.
Already we are looking forward to another visit to the fantastic Woodlake Tavern!< /text>

<review>I love singing there with my band, Red's Blues, and their staff is great. Their selection of food is really delicious. I had the Tavern Burger with salad and their soecial fries. Probably the best burger I've had. We've also had Their Italian dishes. No matter what you order, It will be excellent and served with a smile. JR, the manager, is really nice and kbows what he's doing for sure.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

The menu has some items that look good, and they have an alright drinks selection.  They seem to take pride in what they are trying to do, and it's nice that the back patio area is opened up for use.  That being said, I got the happy hour Mac and Cheese, which was mediocre, at best.  I'll definitely go back to try out more of the menu, just hoping it's more impressive than my first taste.</Text>< user_name>

<Text>Really excellent selection of interesting comfort foods, with a large focus on bbq. The brisket fries are delicious,  and paired nicely with the jalapeno slaw. Definitely add the brussel sprouts as a side,  because they are a wonderful crispy compliment. Also highly recommend the Louisiana Old Fashioned as a before, during,  and after cocktail.</Text></record>

<Text>Beautiful building, passionate service and great food. We received a recommendation from one of the local shops, and we were not disappointed. We shared the carnivore small plate, gnocci small plate and the tavern burger. They we're all different, but equally delicious. Next time I would like to try the steak frites.
Save room for dessert! We chose the blackberry hand pie and goat cheese ice cream. I'm not even sure what else was on the menu, because that caught my eye right away. It takes about 10 minutes to make, but worth it. I would take a big bowl of that goat cheese ice cream anytime.< /Text></record>

My best friend and I are searching for the perfect Happy Hour experience.  Our 1st impressions at Woodlake Tavern: Service staff, very friendly and welcoming.

Pro's: Large Happy Hour portions and excellent dirty martini's.

Con's: The Happy Hour wings & ribs were tough. I dont believe in tearing meat from bones like our ancestors.  Succulent, fall off the bone ribs are the only way ribs should ever be served.  And the chicken wings were well seasoned but a bit rubbery for my preference.  Crispy is the way to go with wings.
Plus, we ordered "well" dirty martinis for happy hour drinks, priced @ $6 per but were charged $8 per. When we disputed this on the bill we were told that there is a $2 upcharge for "martinis". This was not advised when we ordered.  Bummer.
We'll keep looking for our perfect Happy Hour fit.
Best of luck Woodlake in improving your systems and sorting out your menu. 😉<//text>

So much potential but our experience was horrific. Wait staff very polite but oddly after seating my party of 8 they came back and asked us to move.  We later saw a party sitting where we were.  Never go an explination as to why the move was needed. The food had even more potential but agian we we extremely disappointed.  Individual orders were brought out every 15 min. Fries were cold.  My daughter ordered a hamburger with no cheese. We explained to the staff that she cannot eat cheese. They returned with the same patty with the cheese just scraped off.   We then had to explain to them that she is allergic to dairy and has violent stomach pains when exposed to dairy.  I would say the food was decent but for the price and experience I will never darken their doors again.  I would recommend stay away lots more inviting place that will serve quality this is not the place.</text>

< Review>
I found this Gem while looking for new restraunts to try that weren't on the beaten path of downtown. We were comming for happy hour and I didn't know what to expect on a Friday night so I made a reservation from the website. When we got there we waited like literally 2 seconds to be seated. We decided to sit on the patio which turned out to be a little chilly but they had heaters which turned on for a which made me think this would be great for a summer evening that got breazy. We ordered the brisket sliders, the burger with beef talo fries and a side of onion rings. Everything was delicious. I also ordered their cocktail of the day which featured gin and carrot juice honey syrup! phenomenal! and I'm not really a gin drinker. Our waitress Nicole was also awesome  checking on us frequently, but giving us space to enjoy our date. I would definitely come again and bring friends for happy hour or dinner or both!< /Review>

First time impressions: frigid temperature inside; spacious, attractive outdoor shaded patio with lovely landscape lighting and portable dance floor; rushed servers trying to be attentive but very slow service; hard-to-find parking; the band and dancers were on the pizza side of the large patio; we dined on the  BBQ side (different menus for each side) but were still able to enjoy the music; excellent creative craft cocktails ( and vegan/ dairy-free options on the menu; dining companions enjoyed the shrimp grits, Caesar salad with grilled shrimp,  vegetable bucatini & Tavern burger. The Korean ribs were on the dry side.
Recommendations:  reservations needed for Saturday jazz dinners; sweater/ sweatshirt especially for frigid inside temps; allow extra time for dining and parking ( I understand that plans are underway for a nearby parking lot;) dairy-free options for coffee creamer; more servers on jazz nights (I don’t think the restaurant was prepared for so many diners that followed this band); post a band schedule on the website or FB page.
I’ll return for another jazz Saturday but will arrive even earlier to have time for dancing after dinner! I may even try the menu on the pizza side next time.< /Text>< Response>

< Review>
Absolutely sumptuous! This off-the-beaten path restaurant is definitely worth the trip. We found their simple California inspired southern comfort food menu to be delightful and matched only by the spirited and warm staff and quaintly decorated surroundings. On warm evenings their patio is the perfect spot to imbibe in a refreshing cocktail while devouring anything on this amazing menu.

We tried the summer Gnocchi, their Korean sticky ribs and, of course, their BBQ sampler platter. All of our food was delivered at the same time and arrived piping hot to our table. Great detail was paid to the presentation of our food. Excellent execution by the kitchen staff.

The Korean ribs were out of this world delicious. Perfectly prepared to fall off the bone and coated in a sweet and sticky sauce that will make your mouth water. The BBQ sampler was an lively mix of various proteins with corn bread. If you like corn bread, you MUST have the corn bread at woodlake. It is, without a shadow of a doubt, the finest corn bread I've even eaten. The crust was slightly crunchy but the inside was soft and moist. An absolute tribute to what corn bread should be. The sausage was good but tasted like an expensive beef hot dog. The mustard braised chicken was very good and I don't even like mustard. Their standard pork ribs were outstanding with a very light smoke flavor and delicious sweet bbq sauce. I'm not a fan of heavy smoke flavor but wood does an excellent job of balancing very light smoke with the sweet bbq sauce. They were fall-off-the-bone perfect.

Our dessert was just as well prepared as our dinner. We tried the potted cheese cake which we're going to call the peach cobbler cheese cake. The peach was delicious and fresh and the cheesecake was excellent. Very smooth and creamy with the mild tart cheesecake flavor you'd expect. Our only wish would be to provide slightly more graham crumble to the top or, perhaps, add a butter crumb layer at the bottom. We also had the banana ice cream. While the appearance was a little southern cafe, it's flavors and textures were very well balanced. Little surprises await you in this dessert and they're wonderful.

The only misstep of the entire evening was a single, ill prepared, mojito which was short on rum and very long mint. They were happy to remake it for us and immediately corrected the issue.

In short, Woodlake Tavern is an absolute hidden gem with perfectly prepared meals and smiling, happy and knowledgeable staff. We cannot wait to return...perhaps tonight.

We would like to thank Michael, our server, for making our meal unforgettable.</Review>

most AMAZING hidden, classy restaurant in the area. Possibly all of Sacramento. The back patio area and music are nice. Everything oon the menu vey well done. They even pickle all their own veggies and make all sauces etc. From scratch and with local ingredients. The bartender their is quite literally phenomenal. Possibly the only true Mixologist In the area (only one I've encountered).... sit at the bar, you can thank me later for the recommendation.<//Text>

I went with high hopes from reviews by others. Sadly disappointed by warm not hot Bbq ribs. Tasty and just right amount of sauce. Great cornbread biscuit.  Tempura squash was bland, and dipping sauce uneven. Shrimp and grits were flavorful. Sparkling wine and Pinot Noir were excellent. Dessert of Bourbon Chacolate Parfait was grainy and not as advertised as Bourbon first.. Service good.</review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I had such an amazing dining experience here.

Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was the small setting. Despite being new, there was no wait. Still, the ambiance is very elegant. Nice open bar and a few tables. There is even a large, open patio area in the rear for larger events. Quickly, I was able to get a booth that sat my girlfriend and I next to each other.

We ordered a few things.

Carnivore sampler: An array of meats that include ribs, chicken wings, and sausage. Served with pickled vegitables. Everything tasted wonderful, but the wings stood out. Sweet and delicious.

Tavern burger: I ordered this with fries...Which were amazing! The fries perfectly complemented the tasty flavors in the burger. The burger itself has to be one of the best burgers in Sacramento and I don't deny that this maybe a great contender for the annual burger battle.

Chicken pot pie: Such a large serving! Golden flakey crust, a flavorful filling with a hint of curry. Reminded me of a large empanada.

Mashed potatoes and gravy: a hearty bowl size. Savory and creamy. Too much goodness here.

Banana Ice cream pie: our server recommend this to us and it did not disappoint. The perfect end to our meal. Banana Ice cream on top of an Oreo crust, smothered with whipped cream, caramel and chocolate?! Yes!

The service is fantastic and the staff is incredibly pleasant. Immediately after they served me and my girlfriend our food, they genuinely appear happy at our admiration for the food.

This place has set the bar as my new favorite restaurant in Sacramento.<//Review>< Pictures>

My first piece of advice if you want to know what to order is: 1) order the tallow fries. Then 2) order the banana cream pie.
You won't regret them!
Next get the chicken wings and the Mac and Cheese because Woodlake Tavern is all about comfort food that tastes amazing.

The service was great--not too overbearing just attentive enough that I had a full water glass, a drink and an offer of dessert after digesting for 10-15 minutes. Our server was patient with our party of 7, and was quick to answer our questions and easy going.

The venue is well designed with a classy inside, and an amazing outdoor area with the most comfortable  dining chairs I've ever sat in. They are pet friendly outside just please make sure your pup is well behaved :) You can also see the stack from the smoker that apparently had to be placed by crane into its niche. It's pretty cool!

But the highlight of my dinner was the food!! Here is a rundown of everyone's meal.

Beef tallow fries (see first sentence above)
Mac and cheese--amazeballs!!!
Chicken wings--what the what. Perfectly glazed and crisp with a tart and sweet well rounded flavor that complimented my fries perfectly.
Chicken pot pie--they weren't kidding when they said it's the size of a whole pie. It arrived and I admitted defeat before I even took a bite it was so huge! It also had tons of meat and those glorious huge English peas with parsnips, potatoes and carrots. All topped with a buttery crust!
Seasonal asparagus--so fresh and perfectly grilled.
Steak frites-- my husband remarked that the beef was perfectly cooked and tender.
Burger--my friend noted it was one of the best burgers he has ever had. And he is a chef and is serious about his food so I knew he wasn't making it up.
BBQ Ribs--for those in the know, Thursday is $1 rib night. So I added ribs to my gargantuan meal because there was no way I was going to walk out without eating their ribs they slow cook on the premises. The result? A perfectly cooked meaty morsel with a smoky, peppery, tangy vinegary sauce that reminds me of KC
style sauce.

The Crown Jewels of the night were our desserts.
Banana ice cream pie (see second sentence above)
Strawberry shortcake--perfection
Meyer Lemon cheesecake-- not too sweet with just the right amount of lemon tartness it is one of the best lemon cheesecakes I've ever had. Texture similar to NY style without the heft, which made it smooth and easy to eat.
Chocolate parfait--a little bourbon and a little chocolate. Creamy and not too sweet it hit the spot.

Bottom line, head over to Woodlake Tavern because the owners Deneb and Elizabeth have poured their hearts and souls into the first of their trio of restaurants coming to Sac. A much needed breath of fresh air of quality sourced foods made with thoughtful flavors and experiences in mind.
Sacramento is lucky to have them and I can't wait to see them continue to grow!<//text>

<user>116351703966363727011< /user><review>I usually go there for kung pao chicken but because of covid its been a few months. Today I was looking forward to kpc again but I saw a photo of thai garlic chicken so I chose it. Horrible mistake! I noticed the young Mexican cook place my plate of chicken to the side until the rice and onions were ready which was about 5 or 6 min later.  When I got to the table outside the chicken was cold.  Beside the chicken losing its heat,  the chicken had absolutely no flavor whatsoever and it had a vinyl taste to it. Don't ask me how I know that.   I wonder if its good chicken?   Could be.  There was more peanuts and onions than chicken or rice but it did have an ample amount of cashews.  The sauce was just terrible.  I ate as much as I could but dumped the rest.  It was $12 for the meal but in reality it should have been a $3 one.< /review>< gmap_id>

Well if you're looking for something after the movies or a afternoon quick meal.  Then this place would work.  Spend $20.00 during lunch  combo for 2 persons. Not a huge servings size.  Had the House Special and my wife had the Bourbon Chicken.  House Special was nothing spectacular.  Just Chicken.  No flavors or spices.  If I was going back.  I would definitely try something with a bit more spice and flavor.  Plus tables were left dirty. Bathroom was clean.  Would I go back to try something else??? Probably not.< /review>

Good service.  Good food. If you sign up for their app you can get a welcome savings plus earn rewards.  Currently open from 11AM to 8PM per their sign on today's visit.  Very polite & helpful staff.</Text>

The  service isn’t very good, they should really train their cashiers. He didn’t say hi or even ask me what I wanted. He just stood there and waited for me to talk. They also took an obscenely long amount of time on my food, a guy who came in after me actually got his food before I did. They also gave me bourbon chicken instead of honey chicken. I’d give 1 star but the food was fine other than the mistake they made on my order. If you like pick up stix you should probably just use the app and pick it up or postmates it.</review>

<review>There was so much soy sauce on my Kung Pao Chicken dish.
I bought extra chicken for $2 didn't see a significant amount of extra chicken.
I feel like I got extra Sauce.
Stained the water chestnuts deeply. The chicken pieces are so mangeled and smaller than the vegetables.  Not pleasant to eat crunches vegetables and barely chewing chicken.</review>< name>

<review>Today I took a visit For lunch, I arrived at 11:30 I can tell I was one of the first customers to arrive the restaurant was empty and I could see there were no tickets so I can tell I was going to get quick service. I ordered Kong pow chicken for myself and spicy House chicken with veggies for my coworker. The inside of the restaurant was close I understand with the whole pandemic, so I asked Maira(cashier)If we can sit outside to eat she answered yes. Awesome. We waited 20 minutes we didn’t hear anything so I walk inside see if my order was ready, my order was not ready. 10 minutes later I receive my order my Time lunch was over. So I receive my order In a to go bag, I walk outside sit down on the table to eat. When I open my bag I received two Kong pow chickens, I do not have time to go back and complain simply because we were starving and we had to go back to work. As I was waiting for my order earlier from inside they were customers ordering, two customer that  were ordering while I was waiting for my order inside sat behind us in another outside table.About 15 minutes later the Chef personally Walks outside of the restaurant Takes both plates and serve them their plates. So I wonder why didn’t they bring us our plate if we were new they were we were eating outside. The other gentlemen were wearing suits, we were in construction clothes. To me that was personal Preference from the employees which I do not appreciate, the chef look back at us twice to see if we noticed, we noticed and he knew. We had to go inside of the restaurant to beg for our food it was wrong order and chef walks out and serves other customers out side to be exact it’s not the first time I experience bad service in this restaurant. There been time I’ve waited 40min for my food,two times I’ve walked in and immediately cashier says to me rudely if you’re gonna order it’s gonna take a long time rudely . I’ve already made a corporate complaint One with guest relations
Second with general complaint’

Updated Post- Leaving my older review partially in place, but I had to change my Star rating. It seems that they have made changes, staffed up and are getting orders out in a reasonable time now. - End of updated post - start of old post - Such a bummer. It took about 1 minutes to order and well over 40 minutes to get food. Understaffed and overwhelmed. Only one cook showed up, staff is apologetic and feel for them, hope they learn something and doo something about staffing. Lots of upset patrons.< /review>

<Review>I went in this afternoon. There were two tables with people eating and one person waiting for an order. Very  quiet! I placed my order for one chicken entree at 2:53. After sitting for I while I walked up to the counter to access what the delay was. The cook hadn’t even started my order. The cashier told him what I was waiting for. He started cooking a wok full of chicken and then went behind the door and dumped it. He came back and started again. I walked out of there at 3:09.  Sixteen minutes to get one entree when the place wasn’t even busy? Another lady walked in and said that she had ordered online. Her order hadn’t been started. New cook? Or just poor service? At no point was there acknowledgement that it took way too long!<//Review><user_name>Lisa Reynolds<//user_name><user_id>112863638754047261903</user_id>< resp>

$31 for 3 lunches had to wait 25 minutes and no line the cashew chicken (under cooked) and fried rice was to nasty to eat.  Tried to give the chicken to my dog and he walked away.  Seriously how do you screw up fried rice.   It actually deserves ZERO stars.  Last time I’m going there used to kinda like the place now it’s absolutely disgusting.  🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮<//Text>

Customer service is terrible here. They take forever to prepare food. I called in an order for house chicken and waited over 20 minutes for it. When I called I was told 10 and it wasn’t busy here. The lady working at the register didn’t even greet or acknowledge me. I definitely will not come back to this location. The one in mission valley is by far the best!</Text>

I can only base my review of their food on lemon chicken and beef and broccoli, but it's so tasty I have to assume they can cook other things with the same level of quality.  The service is pretty quick for a place that cooks your food when you order it.  The restaurant looks great with it's glass walls and is quite peaceful.<//Text>

I have been eating here once or twice a month for over a year. Only once have I ever had an issue with the food taking a long time to be ready, but on that one occasion the staff was so friendly and apologetic about it and gave me a free entree coupon for my next visit. Otherwise the food is always ready within 15 minutes. It's not fast food, it's made fresh to order so of course it takes some time to cook. It's well worth the wait though because the food is great. No, it's not authentic Chinese food, but it's freshly cooked, tastes good, and doesn't cost a fortune. As with any restaurant, they have a few dishes that really make them shine. You need to order the House Special Chicken, Garlic Chicken, chow mein, egg rolls, and cream cheese wontons! I don't understand how anyone could say Panda Express is better when their food sits under heat lamps all day.< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I will never go to this Pick up Stix location again because of the manager on duty at closing on 1/10/18.

Here's what happened:
I was given the option to dine in or take out when I paid for my food.  I chose to dine in, because my favorite basketball team was playing on the TV.  The cashier was training a new hire and probably shouldn't have offered me the dine in option because it was less then 10 minutes to closing, but we're all human.

Anyway, halfway through my meal, the TV was shut off.  I told the manager that the TV turned off and he refused to turn it on while I finished my meal.  Seriously, it's not like I'm going to camp out at Pick Up Stix...

I am discusted in how Pick Up Stix chose this guy to run their restaurant.  Never again will your company get a dollar from me.</text></record>

We bought some food for our kids at the place. My daughter found a pretty good size of worm in her brocolli.  That was not the worst part of the incient. When we reported the issue to the manager, she was unappologic and showed her “don’t care attitude” We will never come back to this restaurant even if it was the only restaurant in town.< /Text>

I've eaten at this location many times in the last year because I'm a student at Miramar College. I wanted to order the lunch tofu, but the cashier wasn't able to speak English very well and I ended up with the dinner meal. The tofu was completely overcooked and the rice was incredibly bland. Last visit.<//text>

<Text>Service was fine....but the food! I don't like panda express, but oooboy it's way better. Steamed veggies in the entree were not cooked and almost plastic like and the chow mein tasted like pasta. Sad it was my first time trying it too.</Text>< userid>

Typical pre-made Chinese food, similar to the quality you'd get at a buffet.  It was not fresh made to order, they use pre-made proteins.  And under no circumstances is the honey chicken actually honey chicken.  It is straight up orange chicken.  The flavors were ok, not as fresh as I'd want, and false advertising on the honey chicken.< /Text>

<text>Dont judge this place by the outside; this was my mistake. Walked in and surprised by the menu selection. Inspired by the all famous sandwich spots in L.A. And it doesn't disappoint!!! Bomb sandwiches at reasonable prices. Added perk is the hip-hop playing in the background. Great customer service!< /text>< Rate>

< Review>
As you walk into the cheerfully red Deli Counter, you notice the backsplash along the wall: it's a map of LA county, with stars denoting noted sandwich joints like Langer's, Philippe, Bay Cities. Right by the entrance, you then see a stylized C by the section of the 710 fwy, for The Deli Counter itself. The design is at once an homage to legends and an announcement of the shop's aspirations: To be on the top shelf as the other stars on the wall.

A buddy of mine and I went for the most popular option, based on the photos attached in Yelp: the DTLA Pastrami.  And it did not disappoint. Inches-thick mound of Pastrami laced with Russian slaw and a slightly melting slab of Swiss cheese, wrapped tightly in a French roll.

With the Pastrami deliciously warm and the slaw providing a cool, pickled backstop of flavor, the sandwich disappears in a food inhaling instant - along with the attendant chips and drink if you order the combo for $2.50 more. It makes you look up, hankering for more. But take a deep breath, and wait a couple minutes - just as quickly as you ate that sandwich, so will the food coma hit as you realize you just devoured a pretty hefty meal.

Shake off the nap, and stumble out the door back to work - And remember to revisit this place when the craving for a sandwich calls your name.

Does it live up to its desire to be mentioned in the same breath as the other esteemed sandwich places? If they keep showing that same focus and care, I think it will.< /Review>

We order sandwiches from here weekly, great food. The combo dip is my weakness for sure, along with a good selection of Zappos potato chips.  Breakfast sandwiches are also quick and fresh for the morning bite.</review>

<Review>The items here have a urban based name. I had the DTLA hot sandwich and it was delicious. Subtle enhancements to the traditional pastrami, it's offered with cole slaw and served with Swiss. The DUI Dog is also a favorite offered with our without onions. Everything looked good, so I'll have to try a different item next time which isn't a bad thing!</Review><GmapID>0x80dd352312cc3575:0xe8a906fe2ea11879<//GmapID><user>111491427415729284202</user>< Rating>

Waste of money...I cannot believe these people are open for business. Subway could make a better sandwich. Omg was this bad . The manger needs to improve on customer service and if he doesn't like it then he could always change his career or hire someone to make sandwiches. Don't go here. Just save your time and money.</review>

I was excited to try the Chet's Way version of the Cincinnati chili. I was pretty disappointed. The chili tasted like Hormel chili and even though the menu says "shredded cheddar cheese" it was covered in a canned cheese sauce. The noodles were over cooked, and the pastrami was just kind of blah.<//review>

<review>Great hidden gem in the city of Carson!!! My office is within walking distance of this place so I remember when it used to be a quiznos there.  They are actually way better than quiznos because it is real authentic sandwiches which is hard to find these days.  I have had the grilled cheese with avocado and bacon and the turkey club and both were amazing!  The owner James is a great guy too that's who actually made my sandwich.  I have brought a few of my clients and they are addicted.  Bonus is that they have thai iced tea!!!  I definitely am a fan of supporting local business and everyone in the carson area should support this great establishment at least once a week.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dd352312cc3575:0xe8a906fe2ea11879< /GmapID></record>

We ordered the American hoagie which was hearty good the bread was dried out though. Now for the bad news, the chilli was swimming in grease, the 2.99 small portion of Itilian pasta flavorless grocery crap, the soup of the day thin fishy clam chowder, and the garlic bread looked like a ruffles potato chip. I took three bites and it was so so chewy my jaw was aching ! Wow people so over priced too ! No wonder the delivery guy dident wait for a tip !<//text>

Very friendly staff, delicious sandwiches but a little too expensive for the amount you get, either way it's worth it if you're looking for a healthy alternative.< /review>

Stopped by this place really quickly, because my kid wants to ride a motorcycle. Not a full review, just wanted to say the Bike Salesperson Bill was very helpful and gave us  great info on what to do to get started. Will come back after my kid gets the permit and training.
Oh yeah, the entrance is at the corner left of this signage. The other door goes to another business.<//Review>

Worst place among all dealerships and service. Leave the place to never return again. Unprofessional, unhelpful and sneakiest place I’ve ever been.
If you ever been to this place, you’ll understand what I mean , els if you planning to go here, “good luck”.

You won’t regret if you decide to drive extra 10-40 miles to go to another dealership.<//text>

We’ve called this place twice in the last few days, wanting to speak with someone about a new motorcycle. The first time we called, our information was taken and we were told we’d receive a call when that motorcycle was available... We received a call back, in the form of a missed call, no message. When we returned the call, the person that answered rudely said he didn’t call us, put us on hold, and then told us, “I called to sales, no one answered, if it’s important they’ll call you back”. That basically says we’re not important... Two days later we called back and got transferred back to a salesperson, Tim (I believe), who said he was with another customer but would call us back in about 45 minutes... That never happened, and now we’ll be taking our business elsewhere... Rude and irresponsible service, so disappointing.< /Review>

Amazing place to get a motorcycle. Staff is super friendly. If you go there meet Greg, he is an awesome dude. My friend just bought a Royal Enfield from them and the service is great with great staff. Good amount of varieties in motorcycle and they will help you to get your first bike or 2nd one with same passion.< /text>

I wanted to buy 2 dirt bikes from them and contacted them twice through their website but never heard back.
I then called them and was referred to the sales department. Good thing that they didn't waste my time and this was the conversation.
- What are you looking for?
Hi, I'm looking for a KLX140RF and a CRF250F.
- Sorry we don't have any in stock.
Ohk, anything we can do to get them?
- No
Ohk, bye then.
- Bye

I then called another dealership, Monterey Peninsula Power Sports, and they really wanted my business :) They explained me the situation that the motorcycles were out of stock everywhere, and the reasons behind it. And that they could take a deposit from me and hopefully get me the motorcycles in a few weeks. Luckily it turned out great and I got both the motorcycles within 6-7 weeks of the order.

I suppose Fremont Honda Kawasaki probably have enough business on their plate and are ok leaving a few customers on the table.< /text>

This is an overdue review, I bought my very first bike here two years ago, from the very first time I walked into the shop, they were very attentive and very patient with me, since I knew nothing about bikes. I bought my Kawasaki after the second time I visited them, and I was so happy that I made that purchase from them, I love my bike!! Thanks, guys. I am coming back soon to buy my second bike for sure.</review>

< Review>
Bought a pair of black leather motorcycle gloves for the full price. it dyes/bleeds my hands like crazy even under no rain weather. It takes a few days to wash it off my hands....The gloves cannot be washed so I called them back, and they said they sold thousands of the same brand over the years and never heard of this issue...of course...would never return to shop again. can not do business where sells defective parts for profits...

UPDATED: the original receipts and packages is well kept. I only used the gloves once. When I called, rather than showed up personally in store, they said they never had such issues and refuse to replace and never mentioned discount.. I JUST hang up. The replies below actually made me mad since their mouth is full of lies...What a bad business practice. hope they go out of business soooon.< /Review>

Talked to Bill in sales to asked about buying a Royal enfield Classic 500. Dude seemed angry and said they're no longer exporting the classic to north America. I said thanks and before I could say anything else he hung up. 3 Stars for neutral rating. To be fair I called a different shop and the guy mentioned that although the classic was gone there were other options for me to look at. I wouldn't avoid this place but I would avoid Bill.</Review>

Inventory is good. When to go get my bike looked at for trade in and he kept me waiting while he was busy closing a sale which wouldnt have been bad if he hadchecked up on me and not leave me sitting for almost an hour. Have to wait three days now to see what they'll give me for it.</text>

<text>The sales department needs some work... The last two times I've been there was with the intent to trading my motorcycle for a new one and the first time I visited no one acknowledged me at all but the second time I came in it was a young dude who was really nice and helpful. As for parts and service, if you don't have a Kawasaki Honda or Suzuki they really don't care to help you. The service department is always completely booked for the next 3 weeks is pretty ridiculous as well</text>< pics>

< Review>
Purchased a Ninja 1400 R from these guys and that cost $18,000.00./ When i needed tires i purchased off line not no cheep tires but better price then buying from them, when i arrived with my tires i told them i didn't want no one ridding my motorcycle. They got pissy with me about that and i left my motorcycle but when  I returned and drove my motorcycle the front tire had a wobble. I returned and there answer was that's what happens when you buy tires off line. Told them i wanted it re balanced they said i would have to wait . Then he took my tire off and placed it on the machine showed me it was balanced, yes it was but still has a wobble told him to let the air out of the tire and spin it 180 on the rim then refill with air and balance again he said that was not the correct placement of the tire told him i don't care he then said that's the way the tire was going to stay. This place does not even know how to balance a tire much less please a customer in the service department.
I should never have come back here after what they tried to pull a fast on on me when i purchased the motorcycle read on.
When i purchased the motorcycle things were a little sneaky  as well. I wanted the top of the line Ninja ZXR with ABS they had another model that didn't have ABS they told me they could finance the one with out but if i wanted the one with ABS it was going to cost me $2000,00  more down. Then i was looking at the price sticker the top of the line was only $900.00 more than the other I mentioned that and then the salesman came over and took the prices off the Motorcycles and went to the finance manager who was the one that told me i would need 2000.00 more. I told them both that you guys cant go saying prices were wrong and you have to give me the one I wanted. After getting loud they said I could have the Black one Yes!!!. Oh i traded in my 2003 Harley V-Rod that was showroom and had many extras and was kinda sad to hear they would only give me $5000.00. All in all I'm not coming back to this place.</Review>

Like any bike consumer these days, we did our research (250-300cc class), sat on a few to test seat height, read reviews and watched YouTube test rides before we narrowed down the bikes we wanted to test ride. We narrowed it down to the Honda CBR 300 ABS and Kawasaki Ninja 300 ABS. Went to one dealer in Hayward that had the bikes priced $1K lower than anyone else! Found out they had "fees" that brought the bike back up to everyone else price! Good scam to get you in the showroom. Oh, and no test rides. That's bull. We didn't bite. Called David at Fremont Honda Kawasaki Suzuki who had a good selection of bikes and a no nonsense approach. We went in on a sunny day and he still sweetened the deal on the price for us. Great experience. Thanks David!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Very friendly and knowledgeable people. They are the real deal. I bought my CB300F here and did not regret it. No pressure, just helpful information. I got a very fair deal on the bike out the door. Service is simply excellent also. Super friendly, responsive, and covered my bike for a Honda issue free of charge. They are like a family.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>There was no sales person when we went on Saturday to checkout the motorbike. Also there was not even a single bike for Honda CBR 2018 1000rr on the floor. It looked liked they just have a bunch of old bikes they want to sell.

My son and I drove up all the way from Los Angeles on their description of the bike and a verbal handshake of the price and terms. They did everything they committed to, the condition and description of the VTR 1000 was exactly spot on. I'd drive up there again in a heartbeat and bypass a lot of other dealers because of their integrity and great customer service.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>Poor customer service.  I was sold a product that was clearly used as new.  Staff and manager were unsympathetic to exchanging gloves which were one size too small.  Take your business elsewhere, or better yet, save alot of money and buy online.  You will get better service too.</text><Gmap_id>0x808fc74f71da0f91:0xdfddf081f5b75371< /Gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

BAM! Buy A Mattress< /Name>
<Time>1517500211044< /Time>< Rate>

< review>
I am not a shopper. I'm a buyer.  So when I look online for something, I check the hours for the store and I expect the store to be open.   People expect that from me at my Fremont store BAM! Buy A Mattress (gratuitous plug, lol).

So when I arrived at 6:04pm at Fremont Honda Kawasaki Suzuki and the door was chained, I made that little hop that kids make when they're about to throw a tantrum. I just needed a battery so I tapped on the door and the man in the motorcycle outfit came to the door and made a hand motion that they were closed. I held up my phone, pointed and said Google indicates that you're open till 7pm.  His response was unexpected he shook his head but open the door and said, "How can we help you?"  Explaining the situation, he stopped me and signaled the parts manager who is also suited up in riding gear ready to leave. Obviously not thrilled he explained he had to restart the computer, clock in, look up the part manually and he got started. At that moment my phone rang.  I had to take a sales call and put him off.  He listened to my spiel and realized that I was still working too.

I got the right part at the best price available, better than Cycle Gear, better than the big box stores, better than the mom and pop stores and I got amazing service.

Their hours are Tuesday through Friday 10 to 6, Saturday 10 to 5.

I want to thank the manager and the parts manager of Fremont Honda Kawasaki Suzuki Motorcycle for solving my problem after they were officially closed.

They were very professional and I'm very happy.

Want to know how I know I was very happy?   It is because I was glad to give them my money.

I highly recommend you buy your parts for your motorsport vehicle from Fremont Honda Kawasaki Suzuki Motorcycle.  I am a first-time customer and now a customer for life.< /review>

< Review>
I needed some accessories for my bike, & I'd much rather support a local biz than shop online, which was a BAD decision in this case.

I visited Fremont Hon-Kaw-Suz, where the young "Parts" guy stood at the cash register swapping mindless social gossip with the customer who had checked out just before me... while I waited... and waited... to check out and be on my way. I stood almost beside them, and they both looked at me several times as they chatted, so I knew that *they* knew I was waiting to check out, but they just went on babbling and wasting my time as I grew more and more angry. When the other customer left and I finally checked out, the Parts guy admitted that they'd been doing that on purpose.

I'm surprised to see US businesses insulting and antagonizing people who simply want to become paying customers. OK, Fremont Honda-Kawasaki-Suzuki; lesson learned! That was the first, and MOST DEFINITELY THE LAST, time I'll buy anything from you!!<//Review>

<Review>Amazing shop. Don't be put off by the staff like my partner was when we came here. They're not there to kiss your sorry butt and take your money while your family deals with the funeral costs. They've probably experienced more than their fair share of morons who walk in to their shop with no motorcycle license, or let alone have even heard the word "camber" once in their life. These guys are genuine dudes who're very knowledgeable, passionate, and have years of experience under their belt. If you know nothing about riding or motorcycles in general-- please, do yourself a favor and don't be afraid to ask them everything and anything about the subject. Otherwise, you'd be putting yourself (and those who have the misfortune of being around you) at risk. I'm sure the last thing they want is to sell someone a suicide/murder machine. Don't be a squid. Your dank whoolies won't matter if they send you to Chef Crématory's Seafood Restaurant to be used as ingredients in his famous Spicy Calamari dish.<//Review>< pics>

This place is great. While searching for a motorbike for my boyfriend, we visited several stores and this one had his ninja1000 almost a 1000$ cheaper than others. You get 20% off of all accessories the day you buy the bike, although the selection is limited. And I got a good discount on my bike, since it was our second purchase.
This was my first bike - I am a total beginner. So when I couldn't start the bike properly, Amy spent an hour of her free time after the store got closed and gave me an express class in motorcycles. She was absolutely great!
No doubt, we are coming back for our future maintenance service.</Review>

I brought in my 2007 Honda Rebel CMX250 after issues with the bike running, stalling on its own (sounded like it was running out of gas), and having this issue again and again intermittently, I brought my bike in to this shop to see if it could be fixed, or at least the service guys could figure out the problem. They changed my spark plugs for $100 (admittedly, they didn't look that great, but they certainly weren't dead, and changing the spark plugs didn't match up at all with the description of the issue I told them -- a possible vacuum creation). They told me everything was fine with the bike.

Wary, I took my bike back home and even went shopping. I started the bike up again the next morning and after a few minutes, the bike shut down. I managed to get my bike back home, pulling off the road several times, and called the shop.

Thankfully, Fremont Honda & Kawasaki picked up my bike from my house to bring it to the shop. I caught a ride with a friend to get there, where I told them my bike had the exact same problem they said had been fixed the previous day.

One of the guys there said it should be fine (I was adamant that it wasn't), and they said it's okay if I leave my bike overnight and they'd test it in the morning. Sure enough, I come in the next day, and they've got the bike running. I rode around for about 15-20 minutes to make sure. Take it home, next day arrives, and..

The problem STILL isn't fixed. I'm extremely frustrated at this point. I don't bother bringing it back to the shop and decide to dig online to find the problem on a Honda Rebel forum.

Eventually, I and my boyfriend discovered it was a vacuum problem due to the poor quality of emission filters installed on California models of the Honda Rebel to meet California's emission standards.
----
All in all, since the problem was intermittent, I can't really blame the guys for not being able to figure out it was the filter all along.

I am disappointed that they pretty much guaranteed my bike would be okay after changing the spark plugs even after a long description of the problem (sounded like it would run out of gas, switched to reserve, nothing.. probably a vacuum) that changing the spark plugs would likely have nothing to do with.

If you are having an issue with your bike, I would recommend trying to find the problem on a motorcycle online forum first and finding a resolution BEFORE going in to this shop.

I still go to this shop from time to time to pick up supplies, i.e. air filters and oil filters, but it is not the best for service.<//text>

After several conversations over the phone and 1 impromptu visit to see the showroom I made an appt to take a test drive 2 motorcycles.   I drove 110 miles roundtrip to get there only to find out one of the bikes was sold and I couldnt test drive the other because I didn't bring my own gear.  Mind you, I havent owned a bike in more than 15 years - which I clearly explained to the salesman prior to setting the appt - and yet he failed to inform me I needed to bring my own which I do not have.

Once there he assured me I could borrow some loaner gear so I waited long enough for them to change their minds (or their policy) and decide they no longer loan gear for trials...despite doing so for another rider the previous weekend. He then offered to sell me brand new stuff at a modest discount just to take a test drive.

Between the salesman not doing his job by explaining what is required, and management changing their policy on the fly, I will take my hard earned cash elsewhere to buy a motorcycle.< /Review>

Horrible customer service. Came to pick up a new bike In my truck with a check ready to go. Not one employee came up to ask if I needed help. Maybe I shouldn't wear sweats and dress nice when shopping for a bike? The staff was just BSing and laughing in the front and in the back of the store. Took the time to write this while still in their parking lot.. Decided ill take my business elsewhere.</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) ok thanks pend

DO NOT STORE YOUR ITEMS HERE! This place is INFESTED with rats. Rats destroyed my property and they refuse to do anything about it saying it was “an act of nature” per Jeff. Called the 800# in the responde and they STILL have yet to get back to me, so much for wanting to make this right.< /review>

Convenient and easy, Extra Space worked out great for my short term storage solution. The husband and wife team that run the Oceanside location are very easy to work with and made the experience as comfortable as possible.</Text>

Customer service and staff are very friendly and understanding. Got my first month here free and ended up staying longer, thankful for the good prices though. Shout out to Ericka for the help whenever needed. She’s quick, fast and very professional.< /Review>

What a nice facility and the staff is amazing. I signed up last year and met Erica who was professional, pleasant and knowledgeable.  Yesterday I met Jeff, her husband and he was not only helpful but humble and very professional. A great husband and wife team who take pride in managing the operations at the facility.  I have a sense of peace knowing my RV is at a good place with a management team that goes above and beyond.
I am thankful for the service and space they offer. It is not cheap but it is clean, safe and has an onsite dump station and wash.
Thank you!< /Review>

I have received nothing but excellent customer service from Jeff and another female employee (sorry I forgot your name) at Extra Space Storage on N River Road. My moving had several starts and stops and they accommodated me the whole way. Their attitude and friendly demeanor says a lot for how they feel about their customers. I would recommend this facility to my friends.

< Review>
We recently purchased a travel trailer.  Of course before doing so we needed to secure a storage space.  We contacted Extra Space only to find out that there was a waiting list for our size.   Of course we were disappointed as it is very close to our home.     Within a short time we received a call telling that there was going to be a space available and we could have it.  We were overjoyed and proceeded with our purchase.  Extra Space team worked with over the phone and on line to secure all the documents and set us up for recurring payments.  They added a special one time discount promotion and then a senior discount as well.   The interactions we have had with ESS have been very pleasant as well as helpful.   We are delighted to have a relationship with ESS.< /Review>

Thanks for your review and for allowing Extra Space to provide your storage solutions.

I had to fly in from CO to empty my CA  8x15 storage unit after 7 years at the North River Rd. location. Over the year the staff has been so amazing, kind & professional. When arriving on 12-9-20 Ericka greated me with proffesionlizm and a friendly greeting. We arrived about 11 am and didn't leave until about 5:30 p.m.

During this time Ericka and her Maintc. guy helped bring us 13 boxes of and on throughout the loading process. They came by off and on to ensure we had everything we needed and worked with my sister & our large moving company that we hired for a long distance move. They felt like family from the start to the end & went ABOVE & BEYOND.

I have never in my life been so impressed, honored to work with the entire staff at this location. I was truly blessed and would always use Extra Space Storage if all staff was as amazing as this location staff!!!!

Thank you ALL SO MUCH!!!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< username>

Jeff and Erica are very kind, understanding, and helpful. We always felt like our items were safe and secure.

I would highly recommend this facility for your storage needs. I also appreciated the sincere and genuine customer service they expressed. Thank you for being so helpful and if we ever need your services again, we will without hesitation, come back to your facility!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>It's been about 8 months now since I first started renting a storage unit here (my first time renting a storage unit at all) and I'm pretty sure my experience couldn't have gone any smoother. Jeff and the staff are so welcoming and helpful. Their customer service is top notch. The place is gated and clean and it's easy to get in and out to for quick access my belongings as needed. Big thanks to the team over there for answering all of my questions and providing guidance - it made my decision to rent here very easy.< /text>< user_id>

<Text>My experience started with Liz on the phone who was so warm and friendly and hilarious.
She really worked with me to find the right price and location to meet my needs. I met Amber at the location and she was great.
She followed up with me also.
The only issue i have is i saw an ad outside a location that was closer to my house the other day that was the same deal so maybe i can move.
But,  good location,  easy access,  good hours etc</Text>< Time>

I am a customer from another Extra Space facility, but had to move my RV temporarily to this property do to construction work going on in my facility. The difference between management here at North River Road and my facility on Oceanside and College is like night and day . The people here are very professional, I want to give five stars to Jeff to whom I dealt with, he knows everything and is very friendly. All the people here were friendly. I wish my facility had people half as nice and helpful as  at North River Road .<//text>

Jeff and his wife were extremely helpful. They immediately called my husband and I to confirm that we wanted the storage unit after it was reserved. We visited the facility today and were warmly greeted. We looked at the unit and they quickly helped us start the paperwork and get a lock. The facility is extremely clean and everyone is super friendly and helpful. 10/10 would recommend. We chose this extra space over the one closer to our home and we are so glad we did.< /Text>

< Review>
Jeff and Erika have been wonderful people to work with, they have always been very helpful. To our amazement, we needed to empty our 7 by 14 trailer so we could sell it. Jeff offered to help with his own truck and gave a us great deal on a storage unit to put all our stuff in. Thanks to his help we got it unloaded and ready for sale. I have not encountered people so willing to help.

My wife and I are grateful for their kindness.< /Review>

Erica and Jeff have been so special for us. We have had our motorhome stored here for over a year and were looking for a 10 by 15 storage facility and looked no where else but with them  to store some extra goods. They are wonderful people and will work as hard as possible to accommodate anybody and their needs.</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Extra Space Storage On N. River Rd. is a great location. We have had two storage units there for the past eight years.
They recently repainted everything and it looks great. The location is very convenient and large delivery trucks can get easily in and out.
The managers, Jeff and Sabina, are terrific. They have repeatedly gone way above and beyond in helping us.
Occasionally, a pallet delivery will arrive at an unexpected time. When that happens, Jeff or Sabina are kind enough to give me a call so I don’t miss the delivery.
Recently, I had an early three pallet delivery, which was due the following day, so I was left with no help.
Sabina called to let me know my delivery had arrived early.
I quickly gathered the things I needed in order to receive the order and raced over to Extra Space Storage.
When I arrived, I realized that I was wearing a sweatshirt on a 70 degree day with three pallets to unload by myself.  I also couldn’t put everything in the unit and leave.
Not wanting to have a heart attack from overheating, Sabina was kind enough to stand at my storage unit while I quickly drove to my home and changed into a much cooler top and drove back.
I was so thankful that they helped me in a way that was not their typical “customer service”.
I was not “just a storage unit number”.
Thank you again and again.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Ericka and Sabina were amazing They helped me out getting me the right fit for my storage unit.
I'm currently moving and I needed to get a unit right away. I checked out other competitors but I didn't get the same experience from them then what I got from Ericka and Sabina. Greet prices, Great Units, and best customer experience that you cant get from anyone else besides them.
Best Place in town!</Review>

Today Sabina helped me and she was very professional during my interactions with her. The cost was reasonable and the facility is well maintained. I did wonder why there was only two people available to help. Sabina did a great job but more employees would move the process along more smoothly. Just my opinion. Come early so you don't have a long wait. Again, there were only two people working at the desk when I arrived. I have seen more employees in the past but everyone is cutting back now a days. Thank you so much Sabina for all your help. You were awesome 👍.< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Owning a 25ft RV I have been a tenant at Extra Space Storage on North River Road in Oceanside on and off for five years. The place is well managed, the staff is friendly and accommodating. The gate access hours from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. work well for me. I like the fact that there is a dump station, RV/truck wash and running water. It is kept very clean and for the most part everything works. Like any storage facility the rates will slightly increase every six months but Erika and Sabina in the office will do their best to accommodate you. They were able to use a promotional rate to keep my monthly rates down. I highly recommend this place.</Review>

Came in to look for storage quotes.  Sabina showed me a couple different size storage units. Was very informative. Great customer service. Not to mention, they even have the 1st month free promo. Was asked if I wanted to make a reservation, but I didnt want to commit to anything quite yet because not sure when I'm moving. Definitely recommending this place to friends and family who are in need of storage.</Text>

The most friendly staff.  We have an RV space, which are hard to get, but they have the best prices in town, especially if you get an internet price.0  They have 2 wash stations with a platform so you can reach the upper areas of your RV.  Plus a dump station.  We like that they have monitoring system and manager that lives on site.<//review>

2yrs of storing my life's treasures showed no signs of problems on moving day. Extremely pleased with this location..  All good no issues other than $$$ a bit pricey for the size & need .. But 5 stars for being flexible patient with my frequent delay in paying on time.. Never once was i kept from accessing my stuff or locked out...
Outstanding..
Also well protected..
If your in need of a reliable safe well maintained no worry space to store your life's treasures...look no more.. This Extra Space Storage Facility is your IT...

<text>In June of 2018 we had no idea where we were going to move our items. Did a Google seaching and we found Extra space storage. After reading the reviews we called and spoke with someone about renting a unit. The next day we looked at a unit went back to the office and did some paperwork. Office staff was absolutely awesome and a pleasure to rent from. Made us feel safe about leaving our items on their property. Parking lot gated and secure, property clean, hours are great and our storage is right for our items! Currently renting from them so I recommend you go check them out if you need or want a storage unit!!!</text>< date>

The staff at Extra Space storage are super friendly, super helpful, and went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of! It almost seemed as though I was the only thing that mattered. Every time I have came to the storage unit even when its dark out I always feel safe; personally and I also feel like my property is safe. The place is well organized and also easy to navigate. 2 thumbs up for sure!< /Text>

Andy was amazing he stayed after hours just so that I could get my RV off the street. I was in a lot of stress due to a death that day in my family. He was very patient, professional, compassionate, and informative. Andy found me a great RV space and even spotted for me while I was parking! There would never be enough stars to give this man who went over and above his duty! Thank you Andy I look forward to seeing you soon at Extra Space Storage in Oceanside!</text>

Have storage hear, clean friend and secure, plenty of space to move around. I would have to say , best facility I have ever used.  Only draw back is the lack of military appreciation for retired folks. A Marine with 2 months of service rates a discount, but me with 21 years of service, retired, got nothing.
Seem like policy should change a little !!!< /Review>

#1 go to storage facility! I had a U-haul break down inside of the facility and the staff couldn’t have been more helpful with anything they could do to help me out. Sergio even left his personal number with me and said to call him for anything since we were stuck overnight. So, on the rare chance that you’re U-haul ever breaks down, you better hope you are here.. thanks again Extra Space Storage!< /Text>

Extra Space Storage is the best! When I arrived to rent a unit, Shawn was extremely helpful and thorough and made sure I was put in the right unit for my belongings. He even helped me move my 75 year old grandfather clock into storage and I didn't even ask him to! I can tell he and all the staff really cared about me and wanted to make sure I had the best experience possible. My only complaint: there should be a way to write a review directly on your website! Or if there is, make it easier to find.< /review>

I have used this particular storage facility two times now in the last nine years.  There is a 24/7 live on site manager.  The gates only operate for a certain time each day, stopping individuals from trying to get access to the storages at night.  And it's get the first month free, that really is a nice tokens of appreciation from the Company.  If you have personal insurance on your belongings, like Renters or look Homeowners insurance, be sure to bring your policy if you are getting a rental.  Extra Space REQUIRES you have insurance, and they will make you purchase theirs.  Overall it's a safe place to store your belongings.  Clean and well maintained buildings and storages.<//text>

While there are other nearly as clean and well organized storage facilities near me, the people here are well above average in customer relations and plain old friendliness. The willingness to show off the grounds and describe services left little room for questions. And this was from the assistant manager. Only when I needed a little extra help did Lorilee step in and she offered more help than I expected, accommodating all my needs and desires. That is how I describe the whole experience, Exceeding all Expectations.< /review>

Awesome storage facility. Staff was really friendly and helpful, they gave me a great deal and a military discount. Property was really clean and secure. Highly recommend.<//text>

<time>1411071097872<//time><text>If you think all storage facilities are the same, think again!   I have been renting a unit at this facility for five years now, and honestly, the only way I could be happier is if I didn't need to rent the storage space at all.   Over the five years, I have dealt mainly with Lorilee and Carrie, and they have always gone the extra mile to be sure all issues are addressed.  They are always pleasant, upbeat, and patient.  My dealings with Shawn have been less frequent, but he has always been helpful and too.  Even the maintenance people there are friendly and helpful.  These people truly do care about your belongings and keeping things running smoothly.   There are no negatives about renting here, in my opinion.  Whatever your situation, they will work with you to find the appropriate unit for your needs.<//text><UserId.>116879304320860803157</UserId.>< gmapID>

This location was impressive! Friendly staff and extremely clean! Shawn was very helpful and attentive. I will definitely be telling my friends about Extra Space storage, and if they are in Oceanside, I will tell them that this location is their best bet. Thanks for the great service!<//Text>

I guess some people don't know how to do their job. I called a week and a half ago letting them know we were new customers and we'd move everything into the storage today and they neglected to let me know the office would be CLOSED today ALSO didn't put on our file we would be moving everything in today and didn't have a storage for us anyway. Thank God we were able to go SOMEWHERE ELSE and get a bigger cheaper storage.<//review>

<time>1461890441180</time><Rate>1</Rate><text>Been here for almost a year now. Staff is amazing but the property needs more cameras inside the storage buildings.
As of April 12th they notified me that my lock had changed. So they placed their lock on my unit until I was able to come and see. I was in the J section which was in one of the buildings. Once I came I saw there was a totally different brand new lock and new my valuables were gone. Couldn't check until the next day and let the staff cut the lock. Yup the reason I got this 5x5 unit to hold my belongings was gone. Told them they can throw the rest away, no reason to have storage now that my most expensive possessions are stolen.
What really shocked me was that the property only has cameras in the entrances and exits. NONE in the storage buildings making it prime for theft. So chances of finding him? Slim. There were 2 other units stolen from as well in the same F building. Just poor security.
Thank God I got the insurance.
Seeing they had 5 stars was the reason I trusted this property.
Lesson to be learned: Make sure your unit is under 24 hour camera security or make sure you have the insurance to cover your belongings.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

When I had to go from a 3 bedroom house to my apartment I was worried about where I was going to keep all my belongings.. So I turned to Google and that's where I found Extra Space Storage.  I booked an appointment online and within minutes I got a phone call confirming my appointment.  I was told I would be meeting with Shawn and he would be helping me get everything set up.  When I arrived I couldn't believe how clean the facility was and the staff was extremely welcoming, like your second home where you just keep your garage.  I knew that my stuff would be in great hands. Paperwork was explained throughly and all my questions answered.  The first month free deal wasn't too bad either.<//Text>

<text>The kind people who operate this fine storage facility are professional and friendly.
Staff took the time to run through the different storage options. A 5'x15' OUTSIDE drive-up unit perfectly fit my 2 bd bachelor pad furniture & things. Fairly priced, facility is clean, secure, pro staff, You guys make the misery of moving mucho less tedious. Extra thanks from me to R. Gaspasangra, your professionalism, quick knowledge of all the Extra Space facilities made choosing your storage facility the easy pick. BRAVO!<//text>< Pics>

And coach Dani was also super welcoming and friendly when she gave me the tour of the workout room, showed me how to work the equipment, encouraged me to go at my own pace, and reminded me good form ALWAYS takes precedence over reps. And even the other folks taking the class were super cool and encouraging! Amazing vibes and welcoming atmosphere HIGHLY RECOMMEND =)</text>< pics>

I love OTF in general - and the San Marcos crew is AWESOME!  Head Trainer Donovan is a talented coach and has the most positive, motivating and upbeat personality.  All the coaches and the front office staff are friendly, personable and encouraging.  Shout out to the other coaches like Cynthia, Drake & Brooke who are also fantastic and inspiring.  The facility is fantastic and the classes are so much fun.  Great workouts!  All the equipment is always in great shape and they take cleanliness and safety to all new highs!  Highly recommend.< /Review>

Even before the COVID 19 pandemic, the Studio was always exceptionally clean. The staff has increased cleaning in between classes and they control transitions during the workout to maintain distance. I feel 100% safe going to class. As for the gym, I love the motivation and encouragement from the coaches, great music and the ability see the work my body is putting in on the screen. I'm always in tune with when I need to push harder or dial it back!< /Text>

I decided to sign up for a month to truly get to experience the gym, as one day doesn’t really tell you much. I made it clear that I wanted to sign up for their unlimited membership for one month ($180). I reassured if this was possible and the staff member that signed me up assured me that this was possible and signed me up. She came across as really friendly. After one month of going to the gym, I decided that this wasn’t the right gym for me and I decided I wasn’t going to continue going. Then, I noticed that they had charged my card $180 for a second time, so I called them gym to let them know that I had only signed up for a month and my card had been charged again. The manager, Erica Rezvani, said that their policy required a minimum of 2 months and I informed her that I had spoken to their staff member about this when I signed up and assured me that I was able to sign up for one month. She then said she couldn’t do anything to help me as this was their policy and I had signed their contract. I told her that this information was never brought to my attention when I was signing up even though I had asked her staff about it and she seemed to get irritated with me. She was very apathetic and unhelpful and just kept emphasizing that I had already signed the contract and that there was nothing that could be done. After a while, she then mentioned that their accounting system did not allow them to reimburse me my money because there was a minimum membership requirement of two months. As an accountant myself, I found this incredibly hard to believe. I’m upset at how nice and helpful they were during the sign-up stage, but after the sale, this was not the case. I was even charged a THIRD time. Be very careful when signing up, as information was concealed from me when signing up. I hope this review can save someone the headache I had to deal with. Overall, it’s just unfair and not right.<//Review>< Pics>

<userid>106039681693499492271</userid><Name>Zack</Name><Time>1567275109494<//Time><rating>4</rating><Text>The place was overall a very good place to work out, but did notice the staff changing their word on the pricing, they definitely seem to be very nice prior to signing up and portray that they are very flexible, but in reality they are not at all. I was promised to downgrade my membership if I am not able to make the unlimited classes due to my personal case right after the first month, yet when I called to downgrade right after the first month, I was told they have 30 day cancellation policy, and that I had to pay for 3 months the unlimited price since I called on the 31st day, in their mind, since I called then on the 31st day, my cancellation policy kicks in after next legit 30 days, so they were expecting me to pay for 90 days at the unlimited price even though few of the team members knew our case and  offered that we can downgrade right away after the first month. It took several attempts to talk to the manager and finally when i talked, she agreed to downgrade after the first month, and i was asked to come in to sign for paper work, when i did go i wad told the prev manager left the company and as per the notes in the system they can only help me so that i pay for 2 instead of 3 months. We attended the classes thrice in 60 days but i had to pay full amount for my family for 2 unlimited months. On the other hand I was not even cancelling, I just wanted to downgrade to their second tier, but yet they treat this as a cancellation and starting a new contract. The same behaviour was also seen when selling their heart monitor sensors, we were promised 50% off on the sensors, but when we were ready to purchase they made a big deal about the pricing, at last I had to show them to a text message from one the agents from the location, when this deal was offered, to get the promised pricing. I understand policy, and abiding to policy makes any business prosper, but i was just confused with information from different people from the same location. On the positive note, I liked all their work outs and coaches though, hence the 4 stars.<//Text>< pictures>

OTF San Marcos is the bomb diggity! At 43, cardio and strength training is a must... OTF hits all the right spots and i have so much fun doing it.... not only have i lost weight but I’ve gained great confidence from thinking i can never be a runner... and now i am!
I take it at the pace that feels best for me every-time and the coaches are able to help encourage you and make sure you are doing it correctly!
I am obsessed! I can’t stand missing class and love how full the schedule is ... #hooked4life... Def have true FOMO... Fear of missing OTF!< /Review>

Staff was helpful, they explain what exactly is the "orange theory". Coaches are motivating and music is great. You don't compete with anyone but yoursel. Your constantly moving. I have already recommended Orange Theory to friends. 😁<//Text>

Jo at the intake desk was so welcoming and super friendly! Made me feel at ease especially since it was my first OTF workout ever. And coach Dani was also super welcoming and friendly when she gave me the tour of the workout room, showed me how to work the equipment, encouraged me to go at my own pace, and reminded me good form ALWAYS takes precedence over reps. And even the other folks taking the class were super cool and encouraging! Amazing vibes and welcoming atmosphere HIGHLY RECOMMEND =)</review>

I love OTF in general - and the San Marcos crew is AWESOME!  Head Trainer Donovan is a talented coach and has the most positive, motivating and upbeat personality.  All the coaches and the front office staff are friendly, personable and encouraging.  Shout out to the other coaches like Cynthia, Drake & Brooke who are also fantastic and inspiring.  The facility is fantastic and the classes are so much fun.  Great workouts!  All the equipment is always in great shape and they take cleanliness and safety to all new highs!  Highly recommend.<//Review>

Love, Love, Love this place! The workouts are tough but when you leave you can conquer anything that comes your way. Coach Donovan and Cynthia are amazing and so encouraging. I look forward to many more workouts with them and the rest of the Coaches</Review>

The convenience of it being just an hour and the fact that it’s a full body workout! Always positive & high energy every time. Coaches always looking out for us with our form & technique. Different challenges & contests all the time, keeping us motivated & inspired to keep pushing ourselves. . I talk about Orangetheory to everyone I know 😉 I’m obsessed with it!!<//review>

<Review>Even before the COVID 19 pandemic, the Studio was always exceptionally clean. The staff has increased cleaning in between classes and they control transitions during the workout to maintain distance. I feel 100% safe going to class. As for the gym, I love the motivation and encouragement from the coaches, great music and the ability see the work my body is putting in on the screen. I'm always in tune with when I need to push harder or dial it back!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I decided to give this gym a try and scheduled a work out for free to check it out. I decided to sign up for a month to truly get to experience the gym, as one day doesn’t really tell you much. I made it clear that I wanted to sign up for their unlimited membership for one month ($180). I reassured if this was possible and the staff member that signed me up assured me that this was possible and signed me up. She came across as really friendly. After one month of going to the gym, I decided that this wasn’t the right gym for me and I decided I wasn’t going to continue going. Then, I noticed that they had charged my card $180 for a second time, so I called them gym to let them know that I had only signed up for a month and my card had been charged again. The manager, Erica Rezvani, said that their policy required a minimum of 2 months and I informed her that I had spoken to their staff member about this when I signed up and assured me that I was able to sign up for one month. She then said she couldn’t do anything to help me as this was their policy and I had signed their contract. I told her that this information was never brought to my attention when I was signing up even though I had asked her staff about it and she seemed to get irritated with me. She was very apathetic and unhelpful and just kept emphasizing that I had already signed the contract and that there was nothing that could be done. After a while, she then mentioned that their accounting system did not allow them to reimburse me my money because there was a minimum membership requirement of two months. As an accountant myself, I found this incredibly hard to believe. I’m upset at how nice and helpful they were during the sign-up stage, but after the sale, this was not the case. I was even charged a THIRD time. Be very careful when signing up, as information was concealed from me when signing up. I hope this review can save someone the headache I had to deal with. Overall, it’s just unfair and not right.<//Review>< pictures>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>The place was overall a very good place to work out, but did notice the staff changing their word on the pricing, they definitely seem to be very nice prior to signing up and portray that they are very flexible, but in reality they are not at all. I was promised to downgrade my membership if I am not able to make the unlimited classes due to my personal case right after the first month, yet when I called to downgrade right after the first month, I was told they have 30 day cancellation policy, and that I had to pay for 3 months the unlimited price since I called on the 31st day, in their mind, since I called then on the 31st day, my cancellation policy kicks in after next legit 30 days, so they were expecting me to pay for 90 days at the unlimited price even though few of the team members knew our case and  offered that we can downgrade right away after the first month. It took several attempts to talk to the manager and finally when i talked, she agreed to downgrade after the first month, and i was asked to come in to sign for paper work, when i did go i wad told the prev manager left the company and as per the notes in the system they can only help me so that i pay for 2 instead of 3 months. We attended the classes thrice in 60 days but i had to pay full amount for my family for 2 unlimited months. On the other hand I was not even cancelling, I just wanted to downgrade to their second tier, but yet they treat this as a cancellation and starting a new contract. The same behaviour was also seen when selling their heart monitor sensors, we were promised 50% off on the sensors, but when we were ready to purchase they made a big deal about the pricing, at last I had to show them to a text message from one the agents from the location, when this deal was offered, to get the promised pricing. I understand policy, and abiding to policy makes any business prosper, but i was just confused with information from different people from the same location. On the positive note, I liked all their work outs and coaches though, hence the 4 stars.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Zootoria knows how to care for your dog in a very good way and if you need training, they train through a proven method of 100% positive reward-based reinforcement training that I myself have seen helping dogs and their owners at any time, no matter what the problem is. Amazing Kennel and GREAT people!<//Text>

The administration was incredible and security monitors were extremely proficient. The entire group is better than average with imparting imperative data, for example, monitor changes. Would prescribe to any building administrator searching for a dependable security benefit.< /review>

Zootoria  is amazing! We left our golden doodle puppy with them for two weeks for board and train. Before Zootoria, he was always jumping and biting on my kids, with general bad manners. After his training, we were amazed at how well he listens and obeys. Definitely money well spent if you want a well mannered dog. Highly recommend Sonja and can't say enough wonderful things about her!< /review>

Hands down the best daycare/boarding. My mini Aussie loves the handlers there so much he jumps in their arms when he sees them. (He doesn't do this at other daycares). I always feel comfortable that my fur baby is being well taken care of. Thank you to everyone at Zootoria!!!!</Text>

<Text>Zootoria is great! Very nice, knowledgeable, and easy to communicate with.. We noticed a big difference in how much better our dog listens to commands after the first two sessions. They gave us great advice and strategies on how we can communicate  better with our dog at home..  I'm so happy I found Zootoria!< /Text>< Pics>

Professional and polite! These guys go above and beyond, we needed extra guards from what we originally needed due to more guests and they provided both female and male guards. Thumbs up!</Text>

They are certainly assisting in finding a site and hours that work for the customer, also their exceptionally proficient security protects. On the off chance that you need a solid and centered security benefit, at that point look no further.<//review>

Bought a protection dog to guard our house in Newport. There were some mishaps along the way, it took six months for the dog to be ready. WORTH IT.</review>

<Review>Great Dino tuning Mickey. I had a stage four installed two years ago on my Harley tried the Harley tuner tried the Vance and Hines tuner neither one of these tuners could ever get it dialed in including many calls to the makers and they kept giving me other maps to try. Took my Harley to Mickey Cohen motorsports this morning he installed a tuner put it in the Dino machine wow what a difference almost like he changed out the entire bike so glad I found this company try them you’ll be glad to. The bike runs so smooth now and much more horsepower< /Review>< time>

Mickey is the man . Recently did a cam conversion to my 19 lowrider but after a few rides it was really obvious I needed a proper tune . After some searching I found Mickey Cohen Motorsports and was very happy I did . The Dyno tuning he provided woke my bike up , I had a big smile riding this thing back home . On top of the tuning he found an issue I've been having with the battery not charging properly .If your looking for someone who will tell it like it is ,knows whats he talking about and wont rip you off , come check out Mickey .< /text>

Life is great, everybody's real nice. Took my victory in, had the rear tire changed 100 bucks. Went to lunch, came back and I had a new tire on the back of my motorcycle. Please make a reservation he is always busy.< /Review>

Mickey...the guru. If you want the most out of your vehicle, a tune up, have a problem that you can't solve...He's your man. A true MASTER....one of a kind. He's the kind of guy that the pros bring their vehicles to when they need help..enough said right there. Try the best, You won't regret it</review>

THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE TO GO if you want your SXS repaired/modified right. Mickey and his crew are the only ones in the area that actually care. They love what they do and it shows. DO NOT make the mistake i did and take it to Berts or Del Amo Motorsports!! They do not care about your ride! Micky Does. Bought my CAN AM new from Berts including upgrades for $70k and it never ran right! Issue upon issue for the last year. Dropped it off with Micky right before Thanksgiving 2020 and i can tell you it runs better than it ever has not a single issue. He even fixed all the nonsense issues that Berts and Del Amo had created.

I only wish i had found MC Motorsports sooner. Would have saved me a lot of $$$ and headaches!

*This is only the 2nd review i have done for anyone on google business reviews EVER! But the SXS runs that good i needed to let other people know theres a place to go and thats MC Motorsports</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdrSi4H20bBY0Qelen9R6oqbtGp2Qf7Kb15TK2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPG0BgiZiKPuFiX-KyI4QGv6ULWn3UL0_KJowjs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

Great shop, went there as a female alone and the guy that runs the place was amazing. He explained everything to me and didn’t try to make me pay for stuff I didn’t need ! Walked out of there with a cheaper bill then I thought. Great place thank you for the help Mickey Cohen Motorsports.< /Review>

Took in my 2020 Street Glide Special today to get tuned. Man do I wish I would’ve talked to him first before I spent $500 on the dyno jet target tune setup that’s complete junk. He’s extremely knowledgeable and gave me a few tips on do’s and do not’s as I progress my build. As for the tune he put on my bike it completely changed the performance I was pretty unhappy with the way my bike was running previously with a generic tune. Overall would recommend this shop to anyone friends and family included, will never visit another tuning center again<//text>

Mickey is the man! After doing a bunch of research trying to find someone reputable to tune my 2016 Indian Chief Dark Horse, I was referred to Mickey and he did not disappoint. Speaking with him it became clear that he was very knowledgeable and proud of his work, so when I dropped off my bike I left feeling like it was in good hands. The result is my bike now runs like a champ! He even called a couple days later just to check on how the bike was running. He will be my guy going forward  and I highly recommend him.< /review>

I bought rear sets and a quick shifter for my R6 and got it installed here. The mechanics were extremely helpful and knowledgeable and the owner was very personable. They even wiped down the bike for me after I brought it in all dirty.  I’m definitely pleased with the service and expect to be coming back as a usual.< /Review>

From dyno tuning to regular maintenance, Mickey's has been my go to motorcycle shop for years. Recently brought my R6 in for an oil change, inspection and to gain some insight on a few parts. Both Mickey and his team carry a wealth of knowledge and will steer you in the right direction if you are in need. Truly an exceptional team to work with.<//Review>

<Text>Mickey Cohen saved the day.  I was to leave for an extended trip on a Thursday and had a tune on my newly built motor scheduled for the day before on a Wednesday.  My regular technician called Tuesday night and said his dyno broke down.  I called three tuners first thing Wednesday morning and Mickey was the only one who called me back.

When I explained my predicament, without hesitation, he said bring it in and he would get it done that day.  My Power Commander V was first generation and was never updated and had to be “flashed”(?).  This took some time.  During every stage of the tuning process, Mickey explained in detail what neeDo  to be done and why.  He even gave me suggestions for a more efficient exhaust and suspension upgrades, which I am considering.

In conclusion, do not hesitate taking your motorcycle to Mickey Cohen Motorsports.  It does not matter what type of m/c you have, he works on all of them.  Coincidently, I read a magazine article describing how Mickey assisted Triumph in taking a race version of one of their bikes and converting it to a street version.  His mechanic is also top notch.  You can’t go wrong taking your bike to Mickey.  He is the real deal.  BTW, my bike ran great on the trip.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Mick's an absolute badass. Great guy to talk with about bikes and has over a decade of experience. Took a Rocket 3 with a modified air system to him and now it rides like a dream. Power curve is nice and flat. Predictable across the board. There's no stopping this bike now.<//Text>

Knowledge. Experience. Customer Service. Personality and "I Care" Attitude. These are what I found at Mickey Cohen Motorsports recently when I took my Triump Thunderbird 1600 in for its 24k service. Not only was this the "big one" on service but also a test if he would be the one to finally get this bike properly tuned after many attempts by others. I landed a Royal Flush bringing my bike here and because of him and his team I have a promising future with my Thunderbird. Mickey, you d'man. Thank you so very much!!! Looking forward to bringing you my Guzzi next. But for now me and my trusting companion are back on the road ready for more adventures and memories!< /text>

Everyone there is nice and friendly except mickey, he tried charging me triple the price we agreed on but also scratched my $2800 fairing, radiator pip, and full exhaust system that they put on. Also hey threw my ninja H2 on the dyno without strapping it up. Definitely not a professional place.< /Review>

<Text>Mickey is a great guy, just got my HD low rider s back from him. He installed cams for me and put it up on the dyno to dial it in and man day and night difference. He knows his stuff so if you ever need anything done to your bike give Mickey a call and he’ll get you set up right!< /Text>< pictures>

Awesome Experience at MCM with my 2017 Indian Chieftain!  Mickey has so much knowledge & happily shared a ton of info, tips & tricks on not only the details of the performance enhancement but also the maintenance, riding tips & how to improve my skills.  I would definitely recommend MCM for any bike repairs or upgrades!<//Review>

I installed my own cams and brought my 2008 street glide in because it was running rough on canned maps from fuelpak3 and fuel Moto. I had both company’s send me several maps and had power loss from 3500-4000 rpm. Mickey told me he was going to get her running to the best of her abilities and he didn’t let me down. The bike is a whole new machine and pulls harder than ever. Mickey has earned all my business from now on.</Review>

<Time>1497836096101<//Time><rate>5<//rate><review>As a person who is very particular about anyone working on my 2011 Harley Davidson Street Glide, I usually do all the work on it myself.  However, lately I haven't had time to work on it due to my work schedule and so a friend of mine referred me to this shop.  I called and made an appointment to take my bike in on a Saturday.  I'm a true believer in that first impression is always important, ranging from customer service, professionalism, cleanliness and organization and this shop has it all.  I also had an opportunity to hang out with Kyle while he worked on my bike and I was very impressed his knowledge and professionalism. I would highly recommended this shop to anyone who wants honest and excellent service.</review>< pics>

Very professional and knowledgeable personnel. I gave my 06 R1 to Mickey to put a PC V and tune it in the Dyno and he did an excellent job. The curve on the graphic was smooth and constant. My bike feels now completely different, more power, more smooth and crisp and for a reasonable price. Totally recommended.< /Review>

Honest mechanics with years of experience. Mickey is a straight shooting no BS guy, and he's helped me a lot with my Yamaha. But they work on everything. If you need tuning or repair this is the place to go. I drive from Huntington Beach because it's worth the drive.< /text>

Cannot say enough good things. If you have a Triumph don't know why you would take it anywhere. They  took care of my gripes and a few things I didn;t think of. Very competitive pricing for first class work.</Text>

There isn't a motorcycle shop around that has genuine honest good and incredibly skilled people like Mickey Cohen Motorsports does! I took my R6 to them to have it serviced and new tires put on it, not knowing anything about the mechanics of a motorcycle or even what to do they walked me through what it would need and we're so incredibly nice and helpful. They were so lovely and kind there they made me feel like I was leaving my bike with a family member who truley had my best interest at heart! If you have a motorcycle that needs anything take it to them! They're the kind of place you would recommend the safety of your dearest loved one to!< /Text>

I've owed him this review for years. Mickey Cohen's shop is the best. Mickey is a National Service Center for Triumph. La Brea Triumph and those guys in Inglewood don't want you to know about him. Mickey fixes the bikes that the Triumph dealerships don't know how to fix. If Mickey fixes the bikes that Triumph dealerships don't know how to/can't fix, why wouldn't you just take it to him directly? He is the best. Well, I think he is a sliver more expensive than the dealerships, but not by too much, and the cost is worth it. He did my 24K service on my 2005 Triumph Bonneville and the thing runs better than at any time I have ever owned it (got it w/2,000 miles on it). Mickey rocks.<//text>

<review>I've been dealing with Mickey for several years now.  This was the only shop locally that would really work on my '99 Victory V92C.  He was able to troubleshoot a sputtering at the throttle that had the dealer absolutely baffled.  I just bought a '14 Cross Country and I won't be taking it anywhere else.  Mickey Rocks!!  Do yourself a favor and take your bike to him.  You won't be sorry.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<review>Not sure how to describe this but I never even made it to the store due to courteous friendly advice given over the telephone.  I had an issue with my BMW K1200S stalling at idle speeds and a simultaneous issue with my battery and was told they probably were related.  I was getting ready to go to BMW service and presumably spend hundreds of dollars but Mickey Cohen Motorsports gave me some reassurance and friendly advice and I'm happy to say it paid off.  The gentleman didn't even try to get me to come to his shop for a service fee to look things over.  I'm a gullible guy and I don't have the knowledge to service this engine; but I have to say, this store runs an honest business with the best integrity.  I feel very comfortable recommending Mickey Cohen Motorsports to everyone.  Happy riding!</review><rating>5< /rating>< Date>

<Review>a motor is a motor. any  GOOD wrencher knows this.  he charges stupid prices and has a mightier than god attitude because he did a bike for a celeb or 2.  he started as a shadetree , and still is.   having a shop and getting in a few magazine covers will never  change that..    i only gave 1 start because its mandatory to pick at least one to post a review-   i would have gave negative for his junkyard attitude and "parts is parts , sometimes u got some leftover" mentality</Review>< user_id>

Mickey along with his chief repairman, Kyle, seem very knowledgeable of Harley Davidson's and were great to work with and getting my service done.

When I picked up the Harley - we had a good conversation about the possibility of upgrading the exhaust system and air cleaner to maximize the performance and also produce a little better sound-more like a Harley should sound!

So, here we are 11 months later and after a couple of discussions with Mickey, I decided to stop talking about it and upgrade the exhaust to a Bassani two into one system based on his recommendation and his relationship with Bassani, a new 2016 Harley air cleaner and the power commander five fuel management system.

Mickey and Kyle installed the new equipment and Mickey mapped the Harley on his dyno and finished it all in one day as promised.

Upon arriving to pick up my Harley I was totally impressed with the new look and anxious to ride and hear the new sound which turned out to be just what I had hoped for. Not too obnoxious - just a good mellow Harley sound. Also very notable was the throttle response and performance of that Harley 103 cubic inch motor.

I highly recommend Mickey Cohen's shop for repair of any motorcycle and plan to continue to utilize his services for as long as I am riding.

A big THANKS to Mickey  and Kyle for superior service and support and being great guys to work with as well.

Best shop to go to! Owner is very knowledgable and provides top service. He explains to you well the exact work he will  be doing and does just that.
Cant put a price on excelent work.
In my case he was able to tell me exactly what was wrong with my bike before he go into it.
I trust him completely to work on my 17 R6, already took it in twice and both times he did an awesome job. Can't thank him enough!
Deffinetly recommend this shop. You will know your bikes at a good place and getting the correct work it needs.

Thanks Mickey!< /text>

Took my 675r to my local guy that has a Dyno! My bike wouldn’t start so he hooked it up to the computer and got a bunch of BS error codes! After 3 hours of head scratching and frustration they told me to come pick up the bike and there was nothing they could do.

At this point I was referred to Mickey by Newport Ducati / Triumph. So packed up the Brit and took it to Mickey! He laughed at the error codes and said there was nothing wrong with the ECU. So I left the bike there and on my way home Mickey called me and said come pick up your bike, it’s all good to go!

This guy knows Triumph!!! No BS< /Text>

I called all over trying to get parts for my triumph, after having many places calling me back days later just to let me know they would have to order the part and that it would take weeks to get here, I called up the triumph dealer which directed me to Mickey. I was shocked when I asked for the part and was promptly told "we have it in stock $8" no waiting all day to get back to me, no disappointment, they had the part in stock that no one else could get me. I love this place.</Text>

Cohen Motorsports did a good job on my sport cruiser (Yamaha Warrior), with a host of bolt-ons and upgrades.   So, not only is C.M. great in the areas noted in the many posted good reviews (namely Triumph), I'm writing to add that this pro shop made a Yamaha Warrior an exceptionally looking & performing cruiser.   Thanks Mickey and Chris!</text>

<name>Carlo P</name><Text>I brought my 2013 Victory Cross Roads Classic to Mickey to tune, after installing some slip-ons, a Power Commander and a larger air filter. The bike ran decent but it felt a little sluggish in 1st and 2nd gear, as if the motor were still choked up. I was also experiencing some intermittent popping from the left pipe.

I needed to find a competent expert, someone I could trust to do the job right. Mickey's the guy. Not only does he own a Victory, he knows their every little nuance. After finding and correcting some problems with the O2 sensors and firmware (that was the first indication that he knew what he was doing), he was ready to map it. Two hours later, his work was done. And I couldn't be more pleased. I love the way the bike now runs in the lower gears, and the way it pulls on the freeway. His map boosted the horsepower slightly, but, more importantly, he was able to coax another 8-10 ft./lbs. of torque from my Freedom V-twin! Well worth the price. I recommend him highly.</Text><response>None</response>< Date>

Dropped off my 03 KLX 400 supermoto for a carb overhaul/tune and I could immediately tell it would be in good hands. The guys there are great and Mickey seems very honest and definitely knows his stuff more so than any shop I've ever visited. This is the first time I've dropped my bike off at a shop and haven't worried since, I can tell that she's in very capable hands.</review>

Had a power commander installed at Moto gp works down the street, had hard idle and issues dying. Guy there said it was nothing he did, must be a defective bike. Called this shop, they immediately knew the issue (other guy installed a o2 sensor bypass, bad for my bike) they removed it and checked the tune, free of charge.

Solved my problem, have my business for life<//Review>

I had a problem with my Triumph Daytona 955i and the dealer had the bike 14 times for the same problem and was never been able to fix it. I took it to Mikey Cohen Motorsports and within 30 knew what the problem was. The shop is very professional, the crew mickey has is very outstanding. If you have a problem with any Triumph or any make of bike I would take to MCM to be worked on.</Review>

<text>Every once in awhile I will stop in and grab one of their hot subs to go.  I usually grab two because they're more of a snack in anything. The Philly sandwich is my favorite but the other ones are decent also.< /text>< pictures>

Domino's on Milpas is my favorite Domino's location in town. The employee's here give great service & always make our pizzas exactly the way we ordered it. My son & I typically get the 2 Medium 2 Toppings Pick Up Special. My son orders his pizza with traditional crush Pep & another topping (depending on what he is in the mood for). I order my pizza with Thin Crust & select the two topping I'm in the mood for. Domino's 2 Medium 2 Topping Pizza Pies Pick Up Special is our favorite because we both get our pizzas custom made to our liking.<//review>

Good Price and Fast Delivery, but I definitely could have waited the extra few minutes for them to actually slice my pizza before they boxed it.  I am stuck at work attempting to slice my own pizza with a plastic knife.<//review>

Ordered a pizza and bread at 11:16 PM, I believed it to be enough time to get my order before they close. never received order even though it said it was delivered. Called manager the next day and he helped me get my order the following day.</review>

<Review>Twice I've ordered from the location their website generated being closest to my house. (live behind the mission) 50 mins go by. 60 mins. .. called to find out where order was, they had cancelled it and "tried calling"...they don't deliver here..  the tracker said my pizza was in the oven..on its way.....I never received a call otherwise. They transferred my order to the other store...90 mins later..at 2 hours I finally cancelled my order....the manager was rude, unapologetic and did nothing to correct the situation other they say "we tried calling", no voice mail, no cancellation email.

Second order with same outcome. Warned my friends about our previous experience and cautious of ordering with them again. . .Sure enough same thing. No call. No notification. An hour later no pizza. Again unapologetic, rude staff cancelled our order, claiming the staff member that was no longer on shift had made the call when we submitted the order and that was the only notation they had. . . And couldnt do anything about it ..

Our driveway isn't the easiest to see so we usually watch for the Delievery drivers call...

There was no call ...

We were watching the tracker like Hawks cause we're hungry 😩...we would have noticed...

Only word of advice if you order through them  - call and confirm!! Cause they won't!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Always a pleasure to pick up my pizza from this Dominos!  They are over-the-top friendly, the store is always refreshingly cool, and they are as clean as a whistle!  Favorite coupon for me is "Mix and Match 2 or more items for $5.99 ea."  This location offers that promo, while most others do not.<//Text>

They screwed up a pretty simple order.  But I was in too much of a hurry,  I needed too get back to work. I paid for it,  and ate it on the way back to my job site.  Would have preferred the right item.  But it was still good.< /Text>

<review>Was seriously & pleasantly surprised that my order (a  pasta & Specialty chicken split $5.99 ea.  with coupon) was awesome  !!!!!  :) Especially since my last order(pizza) was delivered half raw, and the manager refused to replace it if there were any bites missing ! He was horribly rude !!!  Food was here quickly, fully cooked,, and absolutely delicious !!!

<review>Placed an order for pick up, waited, pizzas are coming and going. An employee finally comes over to inform me that my pizza went out for delivery. How? I have no clue since it was for pick up. Driver shows up with it. To be safe I open it and all the toppings slid to one side. Pathetic, so back to Rustys I go. Tried to give Dominos a shot but they failed...<//review></record>

Great pizza but costumer service was horrible. I used the online ordering and it wouldn't let me choose a topping for my second pizza. This has happened a few times and I mentioned it to them. I called them today about it and the guy was being a complete dick. Telling me I didn't know how to use the online ordering and supposedly I'm the only customer they have to edit an order ? How do I not know how to order online if it's not letting me have the option to choose toppings for my second pizza ? All I got to say is that guy I talked on the phone was a complete dick.<//review>

Coming before closing time doesn't assure you're gonna get pizza - they close before the official closing time. Never go there!</review>

Delivery time was supposed to be 24 minutes.  Over an hour later, no pizza, while the online tracker says it was delivered.  No one called me.  Tried calling the store and no one answered.</review>

(Translated by Google) It is ridiculous to wait more than an hour for my pizzas and not to arrive and then I speak to know what happened to my pizza and they tell me that I go to pick it up because the driver did not control my address and the phone number so that you they ask why they don't speak to tell you anything the manager needs to take action in this situation or the owner pissed himself

(Original)
Es riduculo esperar mas de una hora por mis pizzas y que no llegue y despues hablo para saber que paso con mi pizza y me dicen  que valla a recogerla que por que el driver no en contro mi domicilio y el numero de telefono para que te lo piden por que no hablan para decirle nada el manager nesecita tomar action en esta situation o el owner  pesimo sevicio👎👎👎👎< /text>

Nice big spot for quick eats and drinks! The food can be a bit salty but that might be more personal taste. Usually quite busy but people tend to flow in and out quite fast. Ordered a bit of everything and must try the beef tongue! Will be back to try more . We only got to the tacos and dips< /Text>

<review>I love Uno Dos, and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before! One of my favorite happy hour spots in the city, and the patio is open for dining during COVID. I felt safe dining on the patio, as the tables are safely distanced with some blocked off.

The food itself is also wonderful and prepared quickly. You can go light with a salad or have more typical fare such as burritos or tacos, all of which are very tasty. The prices are reasonable for the city and the happy hour is a great deal.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

This place is phenomenal.

Quality of food to the price range you pay for it is UNHEARD OF in the city and that's only the first reason why I've been ordering from this place for my work office for the past two weeks. Not everyday, but I so could if my boss would let me haha.

The people who work here? Grade A professionalism and service. They care about the work they do and to assure you that your orders are top notch. As far as I'm concerned, it's all been well received on my end. Our office is now a huge fan of this place.

I order the Pescado Salad everytime with added cotija cheese. And the salsa they pair it with? Undeniably good. With a kick. Delicious!

Highly recommend this place!<//Text>

<text>Unplanned stop. I smelled the food from Market Street and decided to follow my nose. I ordered a chicken taco and i loved it. The chicken is shredded and stewed in tomato sauce. The tortillas are thick yellow corn. The ingredients tasted fresh and a little spicy. The addition of the Black bean side with queso fresco was exciting and tasty with the right amount of salt and cream. The green salsa verde is tangy with a hint of spice. Loved this place. I will return.</text></record>

Great place, amazing location and tasty food.

Great tasty Mexican food, they served breakfast till 10.00 am , lunch, happy hour and dinner.

They open weekdays 7.00 am and closes at 9.00 pm.

They are priced reasonably. And have wide variety of tacos , burritos , salads chips and salsas.

They serve bear, amazing margarita!!!

They have ample seating inside and patio seats.

I love their breakfast burrito, taco salads and Gordita!

This place is amazing spot for happy hour for its location, choices of drinks, space to get together.</review>

<Review>Lengua, Carnitas, Asada, Tortilla made of hand ground corn is so flavorful. Hightlight is Tomatillo Chipotle Salsa!! It tastes not overly spicy, perfect spiciness, little bit salty, so freshly good, roasted chili comes in nicely!! I realized that i was wrong!!! This hits the spot for taco!
But the meat is not much tender!!</Review>< pictures>

A best place for a quick and tasty and sumptuous lunch.
I just loved their indoor as well as the out door decor.
They have and indoor bar and dining with authentic Mexican music.
The menu is small that includes tacos,carnitas, burritos and salads with vegetable's,chicken etc.

We had a vegetarian plate and a vegetarian burrito both of them were lip smacking

Don't forget their hot sauce.. a must try.

In the out door I liked their idea of reusing the salsa tins for storing tissues and forks.< /Text>

delicious tacos; casual, authentic spirit; was much busier pre-pandemic but, plenty of space for outdoor eating when it's not windy or cold - a little pricey; wish they were open on weekends . . .     : \< /review>

Uno Dos is a pretty good spot to enjoy a quality Latin meal. I walked up today at 1pm and the line was out the door, but surprisingly, the line cleared quickly AND my food was served equally as fast. My only problem with Uno Dos is the portion of meat is too small. I ordered extra meat and still feel like the portion of meat was small. Otherwise good food, good happy hour deals.. basically go eat there, I know I will</review>

Great spot for sitting outdoors on a warm day, but the food is pretty mediocre. The chips taste store-bought and the tacos are pretty dry, though their salsas are decent. Fun to grab a pitcher of sangria or margarita on a Taco Tuesday, but otherwise, I'd say skip it.</text>

<Review>The tacos were quite mediocre; the meat was dry and not very flavorful, and the ingredients felt like they didn't quite go together. The optional sauces were tasty, which is good because I needed to douse my tacos in them

I liked the cheesiness of the burrito, and the absence of rice actually made it quite interesting, but it was way too heavy on the black beans. It's like they just replaced the rice with beans and called it a day. Quite disappointing and a lost opportunity</Review>< Pics>

<Text>It's a fun place after work for happy hour with friends/coworkers near fidi. Get a few tacos/chips & guacamole/pitchers of margarita for a casual hangout. I typically go for 2-3 tacos and am pretty satisfied. However, it's always super packed inside and outside and so difficult to find a spot to sit.</Text>< pics>

This place was very disappointing. We order 2 carne asada plates and 2 carne asada burritos. There were roughly 8 small diced pieces of meat in every burrito, the rest of the filling was just black boiled beans. They were not even seasoned of refried. The portions of the plates were very disappointing as well. They give you 3 tortillas in every order, you're lucky if you make 2 decent tacos. I reordered another burrito with extra meat. The burrito was roughly $13 only to be disappointed again. As a Mexican Chef myself, I'm embarrassed that they serve this kind of food, because REAL Mexican food is nothing like this.</text>

<review>My one and only taco experience in the city, and it blew my mind. The tortilla had a soft, cushy, and slightly chewy texture. Despite being soaked in sauces and meat juices, holds up it's content exceedingly well. The condiments they provided was like nothing I ever had: smokey, bold, smooth, and extremely flavourful. The tacos themselves were loaded with heaps of meat, and I bet they would taste delicious just as is. The carnitas was especially delightful. So much porky flavour and the meat is tender, juicy, fatty but not oily. A definite must have if you are in town.</review>< Pictures>

The tacos are great here. I had a lengua taco and it was delicious. Definitely a good taco spot. Just be prepared to wait in line a bit. It's worth it.</Review>

Consistent great food. Busy due ng the lunch rush, but things move fairly quickly. This business runs a fair practice for its' employees too, which is commendable and deserves the business that it gets. I'll be back, again & again.< /Text>

Great place. It has a chill vibe and, despite how busy it is, we got our food quickly. I got the Asada Salad and scarfed it down; it filled all my expectations and my hungry stomach. The salsa is to die for: it has the perfect balance of spice and an unexpected zing of lime. Whatever you get here, definitely get the salsa and chips. You won't be disappointed.</Review>

Tasty tacos and decent margaritas. Lively atmosphere. Reasonable prices. Would definitely go again.

The guy behind the checkout counter was very friendly and helpful. Great service! The bartender wasn't very engaging, but did a fine job mixing the margs.</Review>

Great food, fast bar staff, and a wonderful assortment of drinks. This is an amazing place to come after work with your coworkers, get a couple pitchers of margs and you're set. The vibe outside is awesome, lots of tables and they even have blankets they give out to customers during the cold SF summers!<//text>

Service is fast, good vegetarian option (veggie burrito, plate, and salad) and fish tacos, filling breakfast burritos (egg and potato with optional add-ons of veggies, avocado, and/or chorizo). Especially compared to the other options for lunch in the Financial District this spot has reasonable prices (I paid around $10 last time I went there), and breakfast burritos are less than $6.<//review>

Management was really accommodating after my friend and I ordered food and drinks. We received our drinks and sat down and enjoyed the ambiance of the outdoors areas. It’s very busy during rush hour around 6 ish, but they’re pretty speedy and you’ll be highly satisfied with the quality of their tacos. I tried all three: chicken, beef, and the crispy tacos I believe & they’re delicious. I’ll definitely be returning for those chicken tacos.< /text>

<name>Marcus Rosti<//name><Review>Our office comes here all the time for lunch. They have a great menu from burritos to salads but I recommend the tacos above all else. Very authentic Mexican style tacos packed with meat and spritzed with cilantro and salsa.

The place is usually packed for both lunch and dinner but it's not impossible to get a few seats with friends. Also, don't you dare miss the margaritas.< /Review><rating>4< /rating><GmapID>0x808580e9b3089847:0x3a964d5d97defd44< /GmapID>< UserId.>

<review>Lengua taco is my favourite. Also the burritos are really average
Even though there is a lot of space inside we love to sit outside. Overall it`s a good place with a nice music.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

The tacos and chips were ok but im still not sure what the actual hype is about. There's always a line and it's packed. I think it's mostly because of the atmosphere that people like to go but it was just solid Mexican food. Thankfully not too overpriced< /review>

Great place for breakfast burritos, lunch and happy hour!  Opens from 7am to late in the night for the party goers.  Great food after a few drinks too.  Outdoor seating and indoor seating.  If it's too cold when sitting outside they k lend you Mexican blankets too.<//Text>

<text>I've been to uno dos tacos so many times and have always had a great experience- the food and especially the margaritas are so yummy and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a quality Mexican food place in SOMA. However I was sorely disappointed today from the service my friends and I got. We arrived at uno dos at 7:30 (1.5 hours before closing) and we were enjoying some margaritas at 9:15 when a waitress came and took a half-full pitcher away and my half-drunk glass that I was about to grab! They never gave us any warning that they were about to close and they didn't even give us a chance to finish the $30 pitcher we got! I've never experienced this before and I wanted to share my experience as a cautionary tale - keep an eye on your watch when you come to unos dos and make sure you down your food and margaritas at 9pm on the dot in the weekdays unless you want your food and drinks forcibly taken away.</text>< response>

<review>Popular place for after work drinks and casual dining. A little more pricey than needed and don't be fooled by the happy hour pricing. The margarita pitcher costs $27 and technically serves four though  the pitcher is small and the glasses are smaller. With domestic beers at $4 +tip this might be a better move.

Overall you're not really going for the food. You're going because it's a convenient location in the financial district with good casual ambiance.< /review>< pictures>

Best Carnitas burrito and salsa I've had in a long time. Highly recommended...and the price is very affordable. $7.75 burrito. Also try the $3.75 breakfast burrito in the morning. They have a bar serving Margaritas so bring friends.</Text>

Tacos here would compete any nice taqueria in Mexico! My favorite ones are the carnitas, salsa is great and spicy and hand made tortillas enhance the flavor. I also come very often for the breakfast burritos, the chorizo one is probably the best in the city</Text>

<text>Chips and salsa cost extra. So that's an issue. But my tacos and beer were on point. Service is kinda underwhelming too. But WHATEVER it's delicious. I'd still recommend.< /text><Resp>{'time': 1573246907421, 'text': "Thanks for feedback George.

<text>Delicious, fast and friendly.  Great veg options too.  There is usually a long line at lunch but they handle it well, typically you order and have your food in under 10 minutes.

It's nice enough for business lunches but casual enough that you're in and out in under and hour for around $10/entree.  They have a great patio as well.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This place is very casual. The tacos and burritos are good. Nachos are good. Order the large as it is small portioned. There are 3 layouts of seating, a long communal table, seperate 4 seater/2 seater tables inside and outside. They offer free water. If you require a place you'd like to have space or privacy, this is not it.</text>

Great choice for lunch in the financial district for tacos and of the like. I have yet to order the tacos but being in healthy spirit, I have ordered the bowl with chicken and it has been tasty experience. I'm sure I'll order tacos someday because if the salad tastes this good, I'm certain the tacos are great. What I really love most about this place is the abundance of blankets they have for you take to the tables outdoors to stay warm. Considering they are in an alcove on Market and 2nd, this is incredibly thoughtful.</review>

Great lunch spot. The food is spicy and well priced. They offer a wide variety of Mexican food items and a unique setting to eat them in. There is always a line but it moves quickly during the lunch rush.

Bonus points for offering blankets in their outdoor seating section. In San Francisco's unpredictable climate this can be a life saver!< /text>

Your standard FiDi taqueria. Even though it was busy,  they processed people quickly. Outdoor seating is a nice option to have. What was inconvenient was ordering alcohol from the separate bar. Wasn't a big deal, just thought it was an interesting way to break that out. And my carnitas burrito was good. A little juicy, the way I like it.</Text>

First time I've been to San Francisco and I'm happy I stumbled upon this place. The salsa was amazing and had a nice mix of spices. The veggie tacos was just as good and their spicy green sauce was great</Review>

Great place to go after work for happy hour! The food is great, the happy hour runs late, and it's reasonably priced (a rarity for the area). Tons of seating available both inside and outside, but it can get crowded with the after-work crowd so be prepared if you're trying to fit a large group. They offer blankets for the outdoor seating so you can stay warm.</review>

This is a great place for happy hour! The drinks are a little pricey but very good. The tacos are amazing. So is the patio. However, this place tends to be pretty crowded.<//text>

<review>I'm not saying it's bad place. This place just wasn't for me. This place is more of bar, and I'm not a bar person. Overall the food was good and had lovely atmosphere, but I can only recommend for group of people who like alcohol more than burritos.</review>< resp>
{'time': 1554259861164, 'text': "Thanks for the feedback Jim. If you come during happy hour, we do tend to get a drinking crowd, but we're also open for lunch as well as breakfast, where we serve breakfast burritos  for $3.75 from 7-10:30am M-F. Not much of a drinking crowd from 7-10:30am, so come back and try us at a different time of day sometime."}<//resp>

A great spot to hang out after work in the financial district. They even provided blanket if you felt cold sitting outside. I would much prefer the indoor seating anyways. The line for drinks was always long.</text>

Get the fish tacos. So good.
I love the outdoor patio seating, perfectly shaded and a bit of a beach town feel off of busy Market St - complimented further by a bucket of beer. Bonus points for accepting SF weather and having a bevy of blankets available for when the evening grows chilly. While ordering may make you think you are in a Ch, you wont find rice anywhere on the premises. Select your meat (or go vegetarian) then the presentation: taco, burrito, salad or plate.</review>

{'time': 1547234142651, 'text': "Thanks for the feedback. We slow cook our carnitas using a recipe from Chef Luis Flores' grandmother and traditionally, carnitas are not meant to be a spicy dish--they are usually seasoned with a mix of citrus and mild spices. If you want to add some spice, we make our habanero salsa fresh daily, so pouring some of that on your tacos should give you a good kick. Come back for the fish tacos--one of the best items on our menu!"}</Response>

Simply Fantastic! Take the "healthy" style of Chipotle and combine it with authentic Mexican food at a similar price point (if not cheaper), but better tasting.

Then add the tequila bar, beers, the energetic atmosphere, and the fact that they make their own tortillas! You could not ask any more of a play of this style.

Want to eat outside but it is cold? Grab one of their blankets from inside and stay warm!< /Text>

They have good tacos. You order drinks on the left and food on the right line. The service is pretty fast. Came here on a Thurs night with friends and found the place busy with mostly people who work in the area.
The seating outside is nice, can get pretty loud though.<//Text>

< Review>
Good Mexican food. Worst. Customer. Service. The first time I checked this place the lady that took my number forgot to activate by pager so when my order was ready they'd ring me up. My order came 25 mins later because the lady realized she forgot to activate the pager. My food was given to me cold from just sitting on the counter nobody knowing who's order it belonged too. Strike 1. The second time I went in after my first time there. This time it was a different girl and my gosh she was the nastiest employee. She rolled her eyes at me as she was taking my order and kept giving me dirty looks. And if I didn't ask to speak to a manager about her dirty attitude it was because there were people behind me and I was on a lunch break with no time for drama or causing a scene. I asked for sour cream which they charmed me for but forgot to give it to me. They'll take your business but won't provide good customer service.<//Review>

Went by myself 1 Taco Tuesday night after work. I like the ambience, the tacos were very tasty, staff was friendly, restaurant & bathroom clean, and my margarita was on point. I will be back....by myself and with friends. P.S. The outdoor dining is marvelous and they have those beautiful Mexican blankets for you to ward off the chill.</review>

I ordered a salad and they put about two full jalapenos in there (I think they thought they were bell peppers). So that was a bit annoying and made the salad nearly inedible.

Nice spot with a Terrace at the base of an office building in a busy part of town. Beer, cocktails, and Mexican foods. Watch out for 5pm when the office workers fill it up.< /text>

One of the few cheap happy hour bars I have found in the FiDi. The place tends to be a bit crowded and noisy, but when you can get a tasty appetizer and brew for $10 what do you expect.  Usually, if you wait a couple of minutes, you can find a seat, sit back, and relax.</Text>

<Text>We decided to check out Uno Dos Tacos while in town for a conference.  Got there to find a line that was poking just outside the door - seemed like a good sign.  It turns out that there's not a lot of room to queue up, but the line grew as we were there.  Tried the Asada, Carnitas and Tinga tacos - loved each one of them.  Tortillas are made fresh, the seasonings were perfect, and the agua fresca we tried was delicious.  I understand why it's such a popular lunch spot.</Text>< Pictures>

GLUTEN FREE TACOS THAT ARE AMAZING.
PITCHERS. Omg.. the best paloma pitcher in the CITTY. NO JOKE.

The servers and bartenders are sweet and nice. Good for crowds good for dates and all around.

They have blankets when you're cold. The music is fun and never too loud. I really appreciate the existence of this place.

Oh and they contribute their food to some local nonprofits so that's amazing.</Review>

Only cheap alcohol and tacos. It's very crowded most if the required time and they don't even have cameras in there branch. Lots of things got stolen recently from there,  and no one cares about security.</text>

<Text>Great location and a cozy amount of seating. Their menu was easy to navigate. I ate four tacos (2-asada 2-carnitas) each had a different flavor that packed a punch! They were generous with their portions and served me less than 10 min after I placed my order:

I’ve been looking for some authentic taco spots and this was one of the first places that did not let me down.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The food is great,  atmosphere is live,  they are very quick to fulfill your food order,  Sandy the bartender makes wonderful drinks and the lines go down fast.  Uno Dos is a great place for an after work happy hour, a place to hang out for lunch,  or if you want a quick cheap breakfast.</Review>

<Response>None</Response><review>Honestly, it has the feel and menu similar to Chipotle, which ironically, is located one block away. Your options are either tacos, burrito or salad bowl and then you pick your choice of meat. Taste is decent but I'm not sure it's worth the price. They do have the outdoor patio that's great for sunny days, blankets for when it gets cold and a good happy hour.</review>< UserId.>

I always assumed a breakfast burrito was a burrito you ate in the morning. Not really ready for beans and rice in the morning I always steered clear. But having no other option I decided to go for it this morning. To my amazement a breakfast burrito is basically an omelette wrapped in a tortilla. And it is the best idea ever!
Can not believe how good it was and why I've withheld it from myself for so long.
Will catch up, also since they cost only $3.50!< /Text>

<Text>Went here for happy hour for $5 bites and $4 beers or $6.75 margarita's from 4pm-8pm. The food was good. I recommend the flautas because they are covered in guacamole with Oaxacan cheese and are a decent size for the happy hour menu. The service was great from the two ladies working the food counter and tequila bar. Very personable host and gave good recommendations for our first time being there.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808580e9b3089847:0x3a964d5d97defd44< /gmapID></record>

<text>Outside seating is plentiful; they even have blankets you can borrow if it's cold. Inside are a several tables lining the wall and a few community tables with bar stool seating Carnitas taco is filled with meat that is very moist and flavorful.   Pescado taco has a batter-fried strip of fish that is well balanced and not too dense.  Tequila bar opposite the counter looks pretty well stocked.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Fish was okay, but for a little piece that's mostly just fried batter, the value is off. The door props open and people never close it behind them, so the whole place becomes cold and drafty.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Good, popular taco place. A decent amount of meat choices but you can only get tacos, burritos, salad, or a plate with one or two such as enchiladas. The carne asada was a little disappointing because it was slightly overdone but the vegetarian taco is great! Usually a line at lunch time but the service is still pretty quick!< /Review>

The vegetable mix was uninspired and the spicing was bland. The black beans were nothing special. I did enjoy the bottled salsa. I also appreciated the blankets they offered on the cold patio. If I were to come again, which I don't plan to do, I'd try a burrito.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808580e9b3089847:0x3a964d5d97defd44</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

No extra/unnecessary or fancy af ingredients. Just your simple Mexican food. Carnitas burrito was delicious and the pescado salad was good as well. It doesn't look like a lot of food but it is very filling. The salsa that is on the table was bomb and the strawberry aqua fresca was so refreshing. 10/10 would recommend.< /review><gmap_id>0x808580e9b3089847:0x3a964d5d97defd44< /gmap_id>< pics>

They do decent tacos and burritos for the location. I'd really prefer a proper hole-in-the-wall taqueria to this shiny spot, but, it's FiDi, so... They're surprisingly fast; most times my food is up literally before I can sit down.<//Review>

Great food that is reasonably priced. All the drinks are a rip-off; several other places in that neighborhood are SO much better.<//review>

<Text>Came here for world egg day. Amazing breakfast tacos, awesome chips and tacos for lunch and dinner too, but can get crowded. Wouldn't go here for lunch/dinner burritos but anything else should be good. Can be pricey<//Text></record>
</dataset><record>
<Review>Unfortunately I forgot to take pictures of the food. We arrived on a Thursday around 6 p.m. expecting a 30 minute wait or more. We immediately found tables ordered our food and was eating with in just a few minutes. As a self-proclaimed Taco specialist and chips and salsa connoisseur. I can't say that it was my favorite but I can say that it was pretty tasty. For being Gringo style tacos I did find them very flavorful but a little salty. When things are salty it does concern me as to the quality. Happy hour had affordable beers and menu items and there tacos were not overly priced. I was not a big fan of the gordita Style I prefer them to be stuffed instead of just 2 round discs of Masa. The gorditas should be called something else as they are by definition not gorditas, gorditas should be stuffed. Would I eat here again? Yes if it was right by me, but I won't make a special trip back.<//Review>< gmap_id>

The portion is good, and they serve it with guacamole and pico. I do wish they served queso dip. That would make it even better. Conveniently located to Financial District as well as SOMA.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Five stars all DAY LONG. Of all the places we ate this trip this is the one I wish we could go back to! The burritos were amazing, all the flavors worked well together but didn't muddle into one flavor like so many other places. My husband had the carnitas and they were perfectly tender and the burrito didn't skimp on the meat.
I had the carne asada and it was tender and soft, not chewy, great grilled flavor, and my husband who usually doesn't like carne asada asked for a second one bite! Happy hour has a larger guacamole and chips for $5 and it was perfect to split between two and served immediately.
We came in at 8:30 but we're served quickly and had plenty of time to eat before closing.
And can I sing praises for the prices?! The first affordable meal we had that delivered on satisfaction as well. Keep doing what you're doing Uno Dos.< /review>< Pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>This was the worse Mexican food I've ever tasted. I ordered the carnitas plate, which has beans, rice, pico-de-gallo, and chicken. The food barely had any flavor. Staff got 2 of 3 orders wrong, which I was surprised by since I ordered standard stuff right from the menu. It was hard to find seats here, which isn't a surprise, but the food really wasn't that good.</review>< pictures>

<text>Great place for happy hour. Love the environment with outdoor seating, bar, quick service and good music. We ordered the taco basket Tinga taco, Flautas and Gorditas. Tacos were great. Well seasoned shredded chicken with their house made chilled sauce and yummy mole. Flautas had the nice crunch under the shredded lettuce. The fried pork on top of the Gorditas was the best park of the meal. The salsa, fresh queso fresco and fried pork were a great combination of textures. I'll be back to try their carnitas and barbacoa tacos.<//text>< userid>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>I only went to the pop-up on a date when it was on polk street. good food and drinks at relatively cheap prices. the tacos are comparable in price and taste to tacolicious/nicks/tacko/mamacitas. I don't recall the drink I ordered but it had tequila in it and came in a weird, shallow ceramic bowl. It tasted fine but it was like receiving communion in church.</Text>< Pics>

Uno Dos is a solid Mexican joint with a simple lunch menu and more variety during Happy Hour (like Gorditas!) They have similar options to Chipotle, but with more proteins (lengua, fish) and fresh corn tortillas. I like the Steak, Carnitas and Fish Tacos. The plates are nice too. I wish they had a salsa bar with more variety though.</Review>

Food is just ok. It will barely do the job of feeding you, is not that healthy, won't fill you and is not a pleasure to eat. Very mediocre, but grab a burrito in here if you are in a rush and don't care about your food.< /text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Good Mexican cuisine at reasonable prices, various burritos and tacos very good, homemade sauces also, especially guacamole. Crunchy nachos and a very nice outdoor area. Good tequila selection and decent beer. Frequented by many young people, it is a place to relax with friends. Negative aspects: it closes early, at 9pm on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and at 10pm on Thursday and Friday. Closed Saturday and Sunday ☹

(Original)
Buona cucina messicana a prezzi contenuti, i vari burritos e tacos molto buoni, le salse fatte in casa anche, specialmente il guacamole. Nachos croccanti e una zona outdoor molto carina. Buona selezione di tequila e discreta di birre. Frequentato da moltissimi giovani è un posto dove rilassarsi con amici. Aspetti negativi: chiude presto, alle 21 il lunedi, martedi e mercoledi e alle 22 il giovedi e venerdi. Chiuso il sabato e la domenica ☹<//review>
