This place is great! The food is the best! The employees are amazing! I've been coming here for years. Not the best part of town and the establishment could use a little updating, but everything else is great!</text>

They only spare ribs no baby backs. Of course the spare ribs were very fatty. They had good macaroni salad and potato salad. We also had baked beans and they were a brown sugar recipe. They were too sweet go my liking. We also got smoke ham which was good.</Text>

<review>We enjoy our time there and it was a fun experience for my daughter.  The only downside was that we went on a Monday evening and the restaurant was under staffed. So it to extra long to get start and they missed a few items we order. We also never received the corn cheese that we ordered twice. But the staffed were very nice and were apologetic about the mistakes.  With that said the meats were delicious. Really good sides. I definitely would go again</review><userid>111029970759183517756< /userid>< date>

I think they're delicious, and all of their sides are really good too, unlike a lot of the big chain barbeque places. Also, their prices are very good. Hope to be able to keep enjoying their food for years to come.</Review>< pictures>

The food is really just okay. Quite bland and no staples like brisket, tri tip, etc. More like roast beef and ham with barbecue sauce. We were actually quite disappointed after reading so many good reviews</text>

This small family owned restaurant is a hidden gem. Perfect for a family meal or a quick in and out bite on your lunch time. The food is great and the prices are extremely reasonable. I had a lunch special of a pulled pork sandwich, a side of coleslaw and a drink for $6.59. The barbecue sauce comes on the side so you can add it to your preference. The coleslaw and onion rings were outstanding. We definitely plan on returning.< /Text>

<Text>This restaurant reminds me of a place my parents took me to eat when I was little called The Barbecue Pit in Pacific Beach.  It is long gone in history now but the ambiance is the same.  The menu is pretty much the same. The food is the same great taste.  Especially the barbecue sauce!!  It is a one-of-a-kind.  I wish that I could get the recipe for their barbecue sauce.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The ham and beef sandwiches are always tender--,delicious sauce and cole slaw is unbeatable. Not a fan of french fries but theirs are cooked as you order...never soggy or greasy...great.Navy bean soup is made daily...you'll love it. You know it's good if the recipes haven't changed since 1957.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Just happen to come across this place and thought it would hit the spot. The service is good and friendly. The food came out quick and was really good, I had the special which was the pulled pork sandwich (tender and nice and smokey) with a side of coleslaw (very tasty) and baked beans  . Nothing bad to say here the price was right, quick and I got my BBQ fix.< /review><Rating>4< /Rating>< user_name>

The meats, salads and soups are awesome. This is the best BBQ ever. Reminiscent of the BBQ Pit in San Diego.<//text>

<review>Best bbq ever! We are hooked! We actually go at least twice a month & get a pound & a half of pulled pork separate from the buns and take it home to eat for 3 days! So worth it!
I highly recommend this hole in the wall! ââââââââââââââââââ</review>< Pics>

<Response>None< /Response><text>Friendly staff. Lots of tables. No AC. 2 clean bathrooms. Reasonable prices. C- food.

I was craving some protein and wanted to try something new for the kids. The staff there were very friendly acknowledgable about the menu. They do have a child's plate and multiple sides.

There was also lots of space and tables. The whole place was empty which should have been mildly concerning on a Sunday with such low prices.

Straight to the point. Something is wrong with the way they are barbecuing. Either the meat was frozen at some point or it was steamed to death. Because it was either mushy and flavorless or hard and dry.

Unless I missed it there was only one sauce. It was watery and sweet. Between my husband, myself my two kids we had a good variety of sides. The potato salad was flavorless and I suspect pre-packaged. I know for a fact the onion rings were, but they were the best part of my meal so I'm not going to complain there. The macaroni salad look like it came from a box, but my twins sure liked it. There was also ketchup and mustard available. The barbecued beans were also very solid. The ribs had gristle filled fat and I was so saddened.

There was no AC but some fans were running. Pretty tolerable heat, but probably not a place to bring someone of poor health or advanced age. Both a male and female bathroom in the back, although you have to walk through the kitchen. They were both clean and solidly maintained.

Maybe I am spoiled after having lived in Mississippi. But I don't think I would ever go back there. Even though the staff were really positive and helpful, that's the only thing that saved it from being two stars really. No flavour, depressing sides and no BBQ variety.</text><GmapID>0x80dbf3402aa42b85:0x8e539c4c6105fd14</GmapID><name>Stacey Frisbey< /name></record>

<review>This is absolutely the best BBQ I've ever had. The price was reasonable, the food was amazing, the environment was very nice. They had a giant mural on the wall which added to the hometown feel of the restaurant. I highly recommend this place, even if you have to travel all the way from SD to get there.< /review><Name>Richard Lowell Robertson<//Name><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

The pulled pork and bbq beef were great, and the french fries were crispy and flavorful.  The prices are great, too!  The only negative is that the bbq sauce is too sweet, and doesn't have enough kick to it.</text>

I've been eating here for Over 40 years-!

Everything has really been consistently good for that entire time.

The coleslaw is Tops-! And the macaroni salad is really good as well.

Try the pulled-pork-!

The sauce is very good, and not excessively sweet, unlike some other (un-named) places.

All Slow-Cooked with No 'shortcuts'. IMPO

Definitely my favorite BBQ place-!<//text>

Good, simple barbeque place in the middle of an aging Escondido strip mall. The food isn't the best BBQ you'll ever have, but it isn't too bad by any means. Nice people here too.</Text>

<Response>None</Response><text>Flavorless. Paid $20 for two sandwich combos with drinks. I had the beef and my girlfriend had the pulled pork. Neither was seasoned well at all. Served on Wonderbread quality buns. French fries tasted like they were frozen prior to frying. Macaroni salad left much to be desired. Small portions. For $5 more and a drive, Phils would have been significantly better optiin. Will not be returning to the Wrangler.<//text><Date>1519603107742< /Date>< Gmap_id>

This "hole in the wall" restaurant deserves a lot more business and respect than they likely receive. Their food is awesome and the employees were nice.< /review>

I understand this place has mixed reviews and mine will be one of the most honest you have see on here. First I will say I have cooked in competitions for bbque. So here we go.
First time here when we open the door you can smell the smoke and I had high hopes smells like it should.
Got to counter and young lady behind it was no very friendly and just stand offish. Ordered the combo plate and my lady had pulled pork sandwich.
Went to get silverware and first 2 pieces we pulled out had something on them. We then got our plates it looked very dry but sometimes bbq can surprise you. The ribs Ã2 was so hard on the outside skin it was not bark it was like concrete ate abou 3/4 out of the 2 (no rub or flavor was tasted very bland) the ham was the bright spot though cold it had good flavor.... the brisket was the worst I have ever seen or tasted I actually had to ask the girl if it was brisket or roast beef. That no bark no smoke rings no anything I have cooked brisket texas style since I could remember and yall this was not brisket. Next the sides mac salad was good small portion though. The baked beans were a liitle sweet for my liking and tasted a litttle old ( oh we were there around 7-8ish at night as well) so close to closing yime not sure. The highlight was the bbq sauce which was tangy and sweet a great mixture.

On to the pulled pork sandwich whivh was recommened was quite dry and not much flavor (might as well crock pot it) the cold slaw was a good slaw and really rich another little bright spot. The onion rings tasted like old grease maybe woukd be better with fresh grease.

I dont write many of these but I take bbq seriously and for the price i think total was 32 dollars I was not thrilled and prob wont be back! I always give bbq a benefit of the doubt if 1 meat is over cooked or not flavorful bit in this case it was 3 meats .

So if you like dry bbq (before) sauce and not to much flavor to tingle your mouth  this maybe be okay for you. Def. Not award winnings by anymeans but a family mom and pop shop in the neighborghood.

Ps no air condtioning in here as well so plan accordingly.</text>

I enjoyed my barbeque plate ! The food was great ! I had myself the 3 slider lunch special . it served  3 sliders and 2 side !   This family friendly resturant / diner was casual and inexpensive . Cozy friendly place . in Escondido ! Reminded me of home .   You order first at counter , sit at a table , and they will awrve you your table when your order is complete . The service was fast & friendly .<//review>

<Text>Love this place! They have smoked turkey now and it is yummy. Whenever we are in the mood for bbq this is our choice. The bbq beans are delicious, dip your fries in it for a yummy combo. Service is alway top notch and they are very friendly. Once you've had Wranglers you will want no other bbq place. Try it out, you will not be disappointed.</Text><user_id>104658437184965924389</user_id></record>

Better experience than the previous owner.  Much cleaner and better quality of the employees. I used to dread going here because of the shady employees. Everyone is happy and willing to give you their best.< /review>

Probably the best auto detailer in the surrounding areas! My ride is basically brand new ! It even smells new! Stellar job and stellar employees! The detailer killed it! My ride was a wreck! And my buddy doesn't even recognize his!< /text>

My visit was the worst I have ever experienced at a car wash. My pick up was still dripping water. I asked for a towel to dry the truck myself. You would think they would have helped. NOPE!!! I will not be back. First and last visit!<//Text>

Family owned, very well done! :) Under new management, and it shows! The new owner is a huge step up from the old one. I encourage anyone, especially those who were wronged by the previous management, to give them a shot!</Review>

The guy who does it is never available ( even when you make an appointment ) we drove here twice for it and sat around for nothing.  The cheaper price tag for the internal clean was worth nothing as it wasted my time and time is money, on top of that, when I complained about this issue the manager only offered the clean to be "more thorough"  it should be as thorough as possible in the first place dude.</Text>< pics>

<Text>Came here looking for an interior and exterior detailing, came out losing value on my car. What a joke. I wouldn't even go here for their most basic wash. I, like the idiot I am, decided to take my car here in a whim. The guy apparently running the shop did a full walk around of the car, going through the trunk, the gas cap, saying how they'll take care of it all. After paying a rather premium fee of $265, and waiting six hours for their interior and exterior detailing. My car came out with more scratches than I came in with, and there weren't that many to begin with. I had to argue over a poor DETAILING job for fifteen minutes straight, pointing out the obvious places they missed, thankfully I at least got a half refund.  The kid running around with a rag mouthed off that it was "just a pine needle" when clumps plant matter were everywhere.  Dirt could be wiped off with your finger in many places.  The mats were sitting beside the car still dirty when I showed up. The photos show for themselves - don't risk your car or money, I did it for you.<//Text>< GmapID>

<review>I drove 20 minutes to get my car washed and vacuumed. I arrived 15 minutes before closing, at 4:45 pm. The employee said I too late to get my car washed and vacuumed. I donât think I was the first to be turned away. There was another car backing out when I pulled in and I wouldnât be surprised if the car after me was turned away as well. Expensive too, $22 for the middle range wash and vacuum.</review></record>

You may be better off doing your own windows.  Last time there I paid them to vacuum and clean the interior and they skipped half of it.  Varied prices.<//Text><user_name>zephyer 1999<//user_name>< date>

My husband spent 6 hours waiting for his car to be detailed today. They said it would be done in two. They broke his drivers side door handle and refused to admit that it happened even though they left the door open for him to get in the car so he wouldn't know before he left. They did not return his floor mats. The owner refused to come to the shop or see him at all. When he went back for the floor mats they gave him two instead of all four.  Very unprofessional ,  I recommends never ever going there !!<//Text>

<Review>I had already been there almost an hour. There were only two cars in front of me. By the time they finished I had only 15 min to get my son from school so I didn't really look at things(except thru all the streaks on the front windshield) until I got home. I COULD NOT BELIEVE I PAID $27.00 for this! I've lived here 35 years that was my first time in there. I WILL NEVER GO BACK! And I will be sharing and sharing my pictures and my experience I had here with everyone.< /Review>< rating>

I did just discover while removing my rain mats that the passenger side regular carpet is missing. I tried calling and could not get through. Hopefully I'll be able to get in touch soon, before the mat is gone. Hope I am not already too late.  We are out of town  so cannot stop by. Hope they read their reviews!!??<//text>< Pictures>

First time I've been here in about 15 years.  I was very satisfied with the Silver service that I got on my 1 year old car and the guys seemed thorough.  I'll be going back, for sure!</review>

AVOID AT ALL COST!!! Absolutely worst car wash I have ever been to. You might as well hose the car off your self. There were some polite staff members but the owner was terrible. I started out polite and courteous pointing out scratches they put on the car and spots they did not clean, and he said "It isn't our job to scrub the car." He then proceeded to tell me all the times people have tried to take advantage of him. Terrible experience<//review>

<name>Amy Bashaw< /name><text>This was the worst customer service I have ever had in my entier life. They were so rude to me, they did not clean the inside at all, left my mats out of my car left the doors open walked up to me and told me he cant do any more work on my car and left,  He had to go to lunch. I paid for thier best wash because my little car needed it and they did nothing to it and treated me like i was trash. That kid has the worst attidued i have ever come across he needs to be fired i would not allow him to work for me that whole place needs to be worked over and taught a lesson on service and keeping loyal customers, i have been there before awhile ago what the hell happened.</text>< Date>

They used the wrong cleaning product on the inside probably tire cleaner cause it was so greasy I had to go home and clean it again.

It's run by a bunch a kids and they don't care what kind of job they do on your car! They are very careless and the owner is a bump on a log that doesn't own up to anything that goes wrong with your car. Beware taking your car here.</review>

<Text>Slow, untrained, drug addicts, that are lying, thieving cheats. Management is very unprofessional; dirty, lazy, disrespectful, waste of space. When will they shut Floyd down with all the OSHA and labor law violations? P.S. The Manager is likely to not understand even the most basic of questions and is extremely short tempered.<//Text><rate>1< /rate><name>Tristin Zirbes<//name>< GmapID>

Been here a bunch of times. They have never messed up my order but they have given me light meat on a few tacos twice. Lines aren't bad here and the dollar menu can't be beaten<//review>

The service at this location was good. The location however is now close forever. The reason is probably it was visited by homeless people all the time and they got very few customers to begin with. This place is no longer open.<//review>

Employees at this location scratch and wipe their noses, eyes, and ears with their hands while they work.  Disgusting!  The district manager doesn't return messages when I try to complain about this, and I've filed two complaints with the health department in the last year or so.  They're also very bad about acknowledging customers when they walk in the door. Sometimes I'll stand there for a few minutes waiting for service while employees see me, but no one says hello or lets me know that someone will be there to help me soon. If they aren't the register person, they just ignore me. This is at its worst when there's only one person working both the walk-in and drive-thru registers. They're not good about keeping the restroom stocked with paper towels either. Overall, this Taco Bell location provides a very mediocre customer experience. The only good thing I can say is that when they do speak to me, they're friendly.</Text>

First time at this location and services was good,  but the tacos had very little meat inside the shell. More lettuce than meat!</text>

<Text>Not bike friendly... I went inside the taco Bell carrying my bike so I wouldn't dirty there floor. Needless to say I was instantly kicked out for having my bike. It funny that I kicked out for wanting to spend my money,yet you have people making drug deals in the restroom and homeless people showering in there restroom as well I will not be eating at this location anymore....< /Text><user_id>106181336538367034151</user_id><gmapID>0x80c296e65c5be10d:0xff75e25615524ccc<//gmapID>< Response>

I've been eating her for almost all my life I hate how so many ppl lie on these reviews each person has their own job not everyone there is a cashier so have a little patience they are human and have other responsibilities they are not your personal service and for all those who say that this store messes up their order you are given a chance to ask them to repeat the order its your fault again they are human ppl make mistakes chill< /Review>

This motel is not bad, ived stayed here a couple of times & very clean, sometimes nice & quiet, sometimes a little noisy but its a good place to spend a night or two, its not that expensive its $85.00 a night with $5.00 deposit for the room key wish u get return when u give the key & remote at the window.</text>

Great safe and clean.     I was very impressed with the hospitality this place has to offer and  housekeeping Is simply amazing they get in they get out they do the job right when it comes to cleaning As a performer living in and out of hotels I highly recommend the best inn in Montebello cause it feel like home away from home</Text>

Edit: forgot to mention, unless you look wealthy and formal she wonât attend you, which is very rude and unprofessional.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>First got here and checked around. It seemed clean but soon found stains on sheets, stains on mirror, someoneâs pubic hair in toilet and even found Cockroaches in here. Not a good environment for younger kids and would not recommend this place to anyone else. Receptionist is completely rude and started to even yell at us. When We asked for a refund she refused. I donât recommend this place to anybody!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<date>1558407891917<//date><rate>1<//rate><Review>Called to make a reservation and was told I had to make reservation online if I was making it for someone else. when the gentleman I made the reservation for with my credit card arrived, they refused to let him stay. I called and the lady told me that we had a conversation over the phone and she had explained to me that I had to sign a paper. I told her we never had such conversation. She then to'd me she had the conversation with a man. I asked her her name and she murmured something, I told he to spell it and she said XIV. I asked how was I going to get my money back and she yelled , I don't know. I hung up the phone . I will never ever stay or recommend anyone to stay at this hotel. I understand she has to follow rules . She was not accommodating or even a little nice. Oh and according to her there was no manager.ð¡< /Review>< pictures>

I just went for a one night stay. Overall cleanliness was nice but it wreaked of cigarette when I told them no smoke. Air conditioning is awesome. I'd do another one night stay but prepared with a couple of scented candles<//Review>

The room was dirty. When i open the mini fridge there was about 3 roaches that came out. I told the front office, and the lady was beyond rude and wouldnt change my room. She had the nerve to blame it on me. Ive only been in the foom for 30min and saw this. Then when my mom called me she wouldnt let my mom be transferred to me and wanted to charge me to use the phone. Never coming here and dont recommends it.< /review>

<Text>Front desk lady didnt acknowledge me until I got her attention was too busy talking. Told her I had a reservation.... Told her my name since she didnt prompt anything .... I paid and sent me off to my room.... WITHOUT giving me my key. Asked her to my key and left rather annoyed. Stayed 2 nights, key was disabled the following day so I was locked out of my room. Went to complain and got it fixed. Why disable my room after the first night if I paid for 2. Won't be coming back these people dont have the basic skills to run an inn.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

This place was a go to place for work many moons ago,.. It surprises me how many of these establishments I venture to, that are completely unaware that they choose to be in the hospitality industry yet lack the basics in etiquette, moral or are blindly holding on to their vision of the american dream ehile the customer is left with the check. Last I visited we had a beautiful huge room with basic needs (I would say a microwave in this day and age is a must, I mean having to go to the office to heat water for a cup of ramen is a bit off putting keeping in mind the old asian lady spearing daggers at you while you wait makes one lose their appetite) Anywho,.. Use to like it here, now I cant believe I paid $90 for pretty much a closet to stay in.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The service is good. Only in some rooms they allow smoking and it smells very bad. And one of the people who works the morning shift when the room is delivered is always looking for how to make sure that the money that is left as a deposit for the key and the control and in reality it is little but his attitude and how it is very annoying. makes one feel. They don't want to go back.

(Original)
El servicio es bueno. Solo que en algunas habitaciones permiten fumar y huele muy mal. Y una de las personas que trabaja el turno de la maÃ±ana cuando se entrega la habitaciÃ³n siempre estÃ¡ buscando como quedarce que el dinero que se deja de depÃ³sito por la llave y el control y en realidad es poco pero es muy molesto su actitud y como lo hace sentir a uno. No dan ganas de volver.< /review>

I like this spot! They serve first-cleass food, they have a rich menu, The cook in that restaurant is a professional, I love a lot tasting all their food. The food is consistently good, the service towards the customers  is nice. I  go often to this place and I not even once was disappointed. I recommend this place.< /text>

The Carne Asada Fries here were excellent. Large portion and great value for the price. I got the individual, but they have a family size for a few dollars more. The employees and owner are really friendly too!< /Text>

<Review>Iâm devastated. John and Jay were the only 2 dudes I trust to install my car audio. Back in 2007, I went to John with a brand new 335i BMW to fix the banged up install 3-4!other shops attempted. I had already spent close to $10k in equipment and other BS I totally didnât need. The guys ripped everything out and installed an amazing system for me. Truly talented installers. Hopefully they make it back in  the game soon I need a new system on a new ride!</Review><name>James Lombardo<//name></record></dataset><record>

All Star sound is out of business. The rent kept going up and up and up they could not afford it, now the owner of the property son is running window tinting business I asked what happened to John and I was told they closed due to the pandemic, I was lied to.<//Review>

Went in there with an idea of what I wanted, but no thought on the specific device. The man that helped me went through every device to weigh the pros and cons. The crew here cares more about making people happy than making the quick sale. Highly recommend.< /text>

<text>Do not go here unless you like to argue and be bullied into buying what the owner wants you to buy. Horrible experience. I knew what I wanted to do, what it would cost, and my budget. Owner spent 40 minutes arguing with me and trying to talk me into doing something totally different and spending at least double my budget. He would not listen to what I wanted. It's all about what he wants. Eventually I had to just walk out because I went to a stereo shop to make a purchase, not argue for an hour and be bullied. Believe the negative reviews. I figured they were exaggerating. They were definitely not.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><time>1541819362623<//time><username>David Anthony</username><GmapID>0x80dd33283173dbc3:0x75d10782e3c54027< /GmapID>< UserId.>

These guys are the real deal.  I've now brought 3 cars to them, and every time they've done an excellent job.  If you come in and have a set budget in mind, they will work with you to get the best bang for your buck.  What's really cool is that they also price match amazon's prices, so you know you're getting the lowest prices on everything you buy.  In fact, on a couple of things, I noticed that they charged me LESS than what Amazon charged.

When you visit, you can check out all of the trophies these guys have won over the years from car shows and events.  They don't really talk about it, but it's there if you look.  Also these guys will tell you all about car audio if you ask so that you can make an informed buying decision.  They do this with all of their customers, so if you come in and see them talking to another customer, be patient until it's your turn.  It's worth it.

5 stars for sure!</text>

Excellent customer service. I'm usually hesitant and uneasy about these places for their tendency to trick you into more services you dont need but the owner Jay was awesome and honest! Jay knows his cars and audio very well, he'll be up front and tell you only what you need AND don't need unlike other places that will sell you anything they can to increase your bill. The work was quick and done very professionally, my Car is now bumping music the way I want it to! I will definitely be coming back in the future.<//Review>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>All Star installed some online purchased radios in my wife's and my daughter's Priuses.  I went there for some window tinting after they told me about their excellent experience and reasonable installation charges.
They took time explaining the difference in the various grades of tint.  I had them install a tint that not only cut down on UV, but also IR, so the light coming through my driver's window is not nearly as hot.
Since then, I have had a touch-screen Pioneer car stereo installed, and also a backup camera to go along with it.
I have found their installation process to be surprisingly rapid, their prices to be competitive (they actually go online to determine the best price with the customer).
They have never attempted to sell me the top of the line in any of my purchases.
I would highly recommend All Star Sound to anyone who wants stereo or window tinting installation.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dd33283173dbc3:0x75d10782e3c54027<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Be aware of the owner, he's money hungry he lies and lies and lies. He has the tendency of contradicting himself, as he stumbles in his words.The type that likes to hear himself talk and makes no sense. Trust me stay away from this guy he's bad news. I rarely go out of my way to give a bad a review but this guy was screaming for it. He sets you up for failure by doing a lousy job. Giving you no other choice but to return to fix or finalize the job. This is where he feels you have no choice but  to fork out more and more money. What a classy crook.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

They've got pretty good prices on their equipment. The labor is slightly over priced though. And I wouldn't mind paying the extra if the guy who was selling me the equipment didn't come off as an A hole.<//Review>

They are superb!! I recently installed JL C5 650, Alpine pdx f6 amplifier and JL sub.
They made me understand system well, even demoed me and showed me his car system since my system was going to be similar to his.

I'm in love with my upgrade!< /text>

Staff is great. Dr. Woodman (i believe her name is) was very nice. My complaint is the futility of an appointment. If your appointment is at 10:00 you will not see a doctor/nurse till 10:45. . . .Appointless< /Text>

Nice office. Staff is friendly, accommodating, and professional. Wait times can sometimes be long, but not always. The NP I have been seeing listens when I'm speaking about my skin issues and recommends treatment accordingly. He's very personable and makes me feel comfortable. Based on my experience I would recommend Pacific Dermatology.</text>

<Date>1612897565974< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I had two specimens taken at Pacific Dermatology that I was worried about!  One was on my face and the other was on my right arm.  The one on my face tested positive, so they scheduled me to see a Dermatological Surgeon! The one on my arm was not cancerous but they prescribed a Cream to put around the periphery of the circle.
The Surgeon took a sample and did a Biopsy.  He returned after examining the tissue of my face and it turned out negative!  He returned to me and told me the results and then inserted three stitches to close the wound.  They told me to return in one week. They then gave me an appointment for a week after the surgery and told me to change the dressing daily!  I'm pleased!<//review>< Pictures>

Hi. I was seen by N.P. Jonathan. Honestly,  I thought he was very professional and understanding to my concerns. He gave me options and let me ask all the questions I had. He was very attentive and patience. His bedside manners were great and I have a third appointment with him only because I feel confident he knows what he's doing. I grading him and not the long wait in the office and waiting room.</Text>

<review>I've been dealing with recurring cystic acne and folliculitis that no other physician has been able.to get control of.  My primary doctor referred me to Pacific Dermatology.  I began seeing Jonathan Igo who has been AWESOME!!!!!  Jonathan has been caring and so understanding of my frustrations with my face.  Jonathan was able to think out of the box and came up with the first treatment that is actually working.  I have every confidence in Jonathan and every other provider.  I highly recommend Pacific Dermatology for anyone in need of a dermatologist ð</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><rate>5< /rate>< Date>

<text>Dr. Jonathan Is AMAZING!!!! I was very nervous during my first appointment but he made all my nerves go away and was great with suggesting things without me even having to ask or pry it out of him like I would other doctors. I simply mention something and heâs all for it and very knowledgeable! I wish he could be my dr for everything! Hannah is also a very awesome nurse and made me more than comfortable and stayed professional as well as the dr. I have never had a follow up appointment Iâve been excited for, but I actually am! Receptionist and staff also seem like theyâre putting in all their effort and have great work ethic, not just sitting around like other offices. Thank you for this awesome experience! I will definitely come back when I need skin care and recommend to all my friends and family! SPECIFICALLY Jonathan !< /text>< pics>

<Review>I have mixed feelings. Jonathon Igo was unprofessional. I could hear him and another staff member gossiping outside my door while I had been sitting in there 30 minutes beyond my appointment time.  Itâs definitely not the best dermatology office Iâve been too. I certainly wouldnât see him again.</Review>< rate>

My daughter does to give her trust easy, so I commend them for having super patience, and the tenacity to not give up. It took almost 2 hrs, but they got it done.

<Text>Never wait more than 5 minutes to be seen. Great staff and the doctor's pay attention to detail. I've been to a lot of dermatologist and I feel like they herd you in and herd you out. Then just slap some cream on it or tell you to buy over the counter stuff you've already tried. Not this office! I love them and have referred all my friends and family to the office.< /Text><UserId.>108467868561630842929< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

Lots of forms to fill out.  I was there for medical reasons and they were promoting their spa services to me.  I had to wait almost an hour to see the practitioner. The staff seemed knowledgable.< /Text>

Just go someplace else!
You must read this before you decide to go there.
I went with my daughter for acne medication. The Dr. was amazingly nice. But thatâs where it ends.
We received a prescription that went directly to CVS. Later we received a call from CVS saying that we need to sign at âI pledgeâ. We did. The next day we called to check on the medication, but they said the insurance didnât approve it yet. Thursday, I went to CVS and after they checked for about 10 minutes they said the insurance still did not approve. Monday morning, I received a call from the receptionist at the clinic, accusing me for not picking up the medication therefore we canât receive it for 10 days and we need to come over again. I told her that the insurance did not approve it, she continued to blame me for not picking up (a medication that we couldnât pick up!) and then she said we need to be there on 2/8. I was really angry for the waste of time, but she said we will receive it immediately. She kept blaming me for not calling them saying it is our fault and CVS fault for not calling them and let them know there is a problem. I ended hanging up on her. She was just unbelievableâ¦ a few days later I realized that the 8th is a weekend, knowing that they do not work on weekends I called. This time a very nice lady talked to me and said it is OK to come over on the 7th and do it all then, I double and tripled checked with her and got OK. Guess what? We arrived on the 7th and they said my daughter canât have it because it is not the 8th. The âsystemâ wouldnât let them do it! We just drove for 25 minutes had to leave work early andâ¦ get nothing. Not even an apology. They couldnât care less that one of their workers told us it is OK to be there at the 7th. They couldnât care less about us spending our time to come over. By the way - we checked with CVS and apparently the Dr. office forgot to put the blood work in the system, and this is the reason it was not approved â Their fault!
They should have called us on Monday letting us know that there was a problem with the insurance because for some reason they didnât receive the blood results âwe are very sorry for the inconvenient but you will have to wait another 10 days and come again to the clinicâ¦â. Instead we got yelled at and accused for not picking up the medication and got hassled and wasted our time without a minimum apology.</Review>

<text>I thought the woman Dr. that I got to see for evaluation was wonderful and I would return to this office anytime. I moved to Corona so I will follow up with Pacific's office there. This is the sundamage and allergen captitol of the world so its not a wonder that we may have to wait for an appointment or in the office. Excellent care is what matters.</text></record>

I have been gong to Pacific Dermatology for three years, first in Corona and Riverside, and now in Murrieta.  Their staff is professional and caring. They go out of their way to be helpful.  I have been seeing Annette for some time now and she always explains the issues with whatever the situation is and the treatment options available to me.  I always feel I am in good hands.< /Text>

I had an appointment and I waited for an hour before I was called back to a room. The front desk receptionist never said we are running behind or anything to that nature. When the medical assistant FINALLY called me back she ask âwhy I was here as if she had no clueâ. THEN I wait another 30mins before the Dr came into the the room. As a patient and a healthcare provider, Patient care service is EVERYTHING especially when that patient walks through that door of your facility. Greeting & keeping patients informed of whatâs going on with their appointments is IMPERATIVE!!  My visit would have been somewhat OK had the receptionist paid attention to patients wait-time and if the medical assistant was more aware .. Although the Dr Annette is AWESOME I donât know if I want to return!! :(<//text>

<review>Came in 5 minutes before closing to see if they could help with coolant for my Mercedes. They could not but were attentive, friendly and suggested another garage which could help. If I ever switch to the dark side and buy a BMW, I'll definitely be back.</review>< response>

<date>1555457229864< /date><rate>1</rate><text>Horrible customers service. I went in for some car wax and STP fuel additive. I stood in line for 20 minutes before i gave up and walked out. The two people at the registers were looking up and fetching parts for people. As you know that takes a long time. My only grib is why do you not have a parts counter and have a register for people who are buying merchandise. If you are in a hurry, Do not go to this store.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I went here and I was blown away by the customer service I received from 'Wayne'. This guy was fast, friendly, and very helpful. He was working on a customers car when I got there and as soon as he was done walked right into the store and helped me. I purchased my new headlights and I had to come back because I thought I'd been sold the wrong ones. Wayne immediately saw that I had pulled the high beam out instead of the low beam I was supposed to be replacing. He then went to my car and put it in for me. Big thanks to Wayne for being a great help!!</Review>

Horrible customer service, employees are busy talking between themselves instead of giving full customer service.  Aa representative by the name of Mike has a mouth on him.</text>

(Translated by Google) I bought the shock absorbers for my car from the Monroe brand, I arrived with new ones, I removed one from the car and when I took the new one out of the box, it did not go up, it stayed down, it did not work, I did a lot of work on my car to buy some new shock absorbers that did not work.

<Text>Really good tacos al vapor. Inexpensive. The salsa gets a 9/10, the habanero has a kick. And the cilantro is not mixed with the onion, which is a huge plus for me.< /Text>< Pics>

<name>Diana Blansh< /name><Review>The best tacos al vapor, mulitas are fabulous. Havent tried their quesadillas or burritos but they look delicious. The salsa's are HOT, always gets me on the habanero sauce. Great variety of meats to pick from. Al pastor, asada, labio, cesos, tripa... etc<//Review>< time>

(Translated by Google) The best so far is the second lunch box of tacos that I have tried and they are very tasty and inexpensive. I recommend them, I only tried pastor and head and their sauces are good .. The guys look that they know what they do, I hope they continue to improve.

<review>I called asked this  individual about a quote extremely rude over the phone . this is my second time in there to ask if they can do  a repair . today I spoke with this individual about an Exhaust system for my vehicle its an older Chevy I explained I wanted a simple system apparently they can not do this, but that's ok it was just a question . but the way he handled it was totally uncalled for he rudely said uh yea no I'm not doing that and hung up . Here's and idea when making a sign for your business instead of putting auto and Exhaust put "Minimal Exhaust"  sends the wrong message to customers thinking you can do Any or all Type Of exhaust work . If your Over Dealing with Customers Retire !</review>< pics>

Mr Jack is one of the best mechanics in town. Heâs worked on our family vehicles for years and heâs always been honest and timely with diagnosing and repairing issues. Yes he is busy and sometimes he needs a few days to fit you in but he and his staff do a great job and take great care for your vehicle going above and beyond whatâs expected!
Highly recommend J and J auto!!<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Very incompetent. Went in so they would fix a leak, they change my alternator(something my mom's car needed done recently. probably mixed the vehicles up). To charge someone for something that isn't broke and not fix the issue for which they came in for is wrong. Lost the business of my parents who have been going there for 20 years, and anybody that I know that go there will be warned.< /review>< pics>

I am the proud owner of a 2006 Chevy HHR (if you ever wanted to know, the HHR stands for "Heritage High-Roof" in tribute of the 1949 Chevy Suburban.)  I recently started noticing a coolant leak and of the strength of a friends word, I decided to skeptically take it to J & J Auto.  I don't know anything about these guys so I honestly couldn't have any ill will towards them, but its my baby...and we all love our baby. I received the car today and feel truly rewarded. They did what they said (fixed the coolant leak which was caused by a faulty heater core) and fixed the alignment on my steering wheel column in a timely manner.  Something they didn't need to do but did anyways.  I know it sounds small but  shows that it bothered them as much as it did me, thank you Pepboys in Chico (smh).  I will be bringing her back to you from now on.  You guys are as good as rain in a drought.  Hopefully see you later than sooner, good work gentlemen.</Text>

Gotta say I started with a hand full of problems with my car (smog stuff) however I am truly glad I went to J&J to begin with. As a do it yourself kinda guy I was amazed at the honest feedback I received from Richard. Great guy, knowledgeable and I would recommend getting your car smogged here to anyone.< /Text>

Richard is a great honest guy to have smogging your vehicle. If there's any issues popping up, he truly tries to get things to work rather than just giving up and failing the vehicle. Place is nice and he's a great guy to deal with.</Review>

<text>J&J was an emergency stop on our 2,300 mile Great Race Rally from Riverside to Tacoma.  We realised that the cheering crowds as the 120 collector cars as we arrived in Oroville were also pointing out our muffler was dragging on the ground - the guys at J&J quickly cleared a ramp and welded us up and we rejoined the race...  an amazing pit stop and we completed the race in Tacoma.  Thanks to the owner and well done guys< /text>< pictures>

Excellent work; even does extra for free. The picture they're showing with all the vehicles waiting for service is typical. This is where the knowledgeable locals go. Better and cheaper than the chain stores. I saved almost $300 (around 35%) taking it to them compared to a chain store in town.< /text>

Just called them today 5-21-19 cause I needed help with two simple exhaust bolts for my brothers truck which hes in college... and when I called I told him my situation, he replied back like "who broke them?" I said I did, he than replied again and said nope I'm not going to work on it and hung up...... I'm appalled, worse customer service ever.... if I could give them 0 stars I would have.... Yelp is the next site I'm going to to give the 0 star business a review on, who knows how they treat you if you are the "lucky one" they pick to service your vehicle....<//Text>

<Text>If it was possible to give a zero star review, I would. I have never been treated with such a level of blatant disrespect. We spoke on the phone three days before my arrival, where I told him of my issue, and that I would have to have the car towed down. He agreed, and a few days later, I arranged to have the vehicle towed to his shop. Upon arriving, the owner of the shop "didn't recall our conversation", turned to the tow truck driver (not me) and said "I don't want to work on his car. Get it out of here. Take it to your place", turned heel, and left without speaking a word to me. There I was, tow truck on a flat bed, and no shop to turn to. I understand refusing service, but this level of disrespect was mind boggling.  As I learned from the tow truck driver, this shop owner "dislikes young people, newer cars, and prefers easy projects close to completion", and has turned down about 5 out of the 50 cars this driver has personally delivered to J & J Auto.  Due to the disrespect and rudeness I experienced from this owner, I can NEVER recommend this shop to anyone.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<text>I went in to have a muffler installed.  The owner asked what kind did I want installed, I told them that I already have the muffler and just need it welded in.  He immediately asked where I got it from.  I told him "online".  He said we dont do that and walked away.
Super weird and rude.  Didnt ask what brand, if it was offset, center, center offset, etc...  I understand that it could have been the wrong muffler for the vehicle, bit there was no follow up.  My only thought is that they markup the price on the mufflers.
I actually have no problem paying more to have it installed and paying the markup.  My issue is that they only carry low quality mufflers and I needed a specific muffler for my vehicle (Ram 2500 Power Wagon).
Stay away if you value customer service.</text>< Pictures>

Jack FIRED a employee for taking his asthmatic daughter out of town during the Camp Fire. The very unhealthy smoke in the air was causing asthma attacks. Money seems more important than his employees. The morals and ethics of the owner is awful. Don't take your car there. Jack you have been FIRED!!!</text>

Very rude. I took my 2010 a Toyota Camry in for  all four breaks to be done and an oil change. Was charging 535.00. On top of the high price they forgot to put the bolts on the breaks. Now in out of more money for breaks and wheel alignment. When i took the car  back in for the 3rd time the manager asked qhat did i want to make this go away? I said my money back, then proceeded to tell me that he couldn't do because he had his car parts in my car.</Review>

<text>Long time Sacramento resident and having used many different companies before to save a few dollars - TRUST ME - Sierra Pacific is the best value in town. Don't learn the hard way. We had a major service / equipment install and we were absolutely amazed. I have to shout out a very special individual who is part of their follow up teams - LUIS GARCIA - Thank you so much for the terrific follow up and ensuring our system was just perfect. Do yourself a huge favor and save the headaches - go with the Sierra Pacific TEAM!<//text>< pics>

Went through Costco and Sierra is The contractor. At first I was skeptical and being my fourth quote I was sure I was just going to get a quote. I was needing to replace the Hvac system and needed new duct work as well.  Well I was wrong. Dominic was my sales person. Very Informative and helpful throughout the whole project.
The install team, Kevin C, Matt C and Devin W, worked seamlessly. Professional but fun and left my house cleaner then when they got there.
The office staff was great. They were able to get reschedule the project earlier than planned.

My system is great. Dominic added insulation to the project as well. Price was better than I expected and obviously comparable to others. Actually better because of everything they do. No corners cut and everything is new and better! They take pride in their work and am very happy.</Text>

<text>Everyone at Sierra Pacific was so helpful and professional. From the office staff to the installers it was a wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend them to anyone considering their services. When they were done with the project they made sure that everything was cleaned up and back in place. The installers worked hard and weâre very pleasant to work with. Great team!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I called to get Spring maintenance performed on my AC system. I am new to Sierra Pacific as I just purchased this home. I thought it was great they had the planned service agreements. Unfortunately when my Tech (Big Tony) got here it was not set up, neither was my pool solar setup. Big Tony did an exceptional job on getting my system checked but also helped me get my new thermostat setup. He knew what he was doing and made what could have been a bad experience a pleasant experience. He took care of everything, I will be sure to ask for Big Tony for all my future AC and Solar needs. Big Tony also took the time to explain to me how my system worked and what to watch out for. He is a true asset to your company.< /Text></record>

They installed a full Photovoltaic solar panel system w/battery backup. Very professional and kept me in the loop at all times. Seamless install and state of the art products that will provide us the security of cost savings and never being "In the Dark!" Keeps our internet, well pump, cameras, TVs, refrigerator etc. going when power is out! Great job guys!<//Review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Called them out for pool solar panels. My pool is fairly warm, but would like it a little warmer. As I lived in the home I know the best spot for them. Also having panels in my previous pool I knew what was needed. The first guy came out, but brought no measuring tools, and would not take my word. Due to needs I only need 4 panels in an optimum area. He said they had to install 5, and one in partial shade. The next year I tried again, and the second guy went from 18 panels to 5 again, but said they have to check for optimal sun? I live here 4 years and I donât know? Iâll swim in a cooler pool itâs not that bad. If they have a minimum rate, or install they should say. The salesman was also tryin to sell me a new heater/AC unit for my new home? These guys arenât interested in the customers best interest.< /review>< pictures>

I had the best service  experience  provided by the young person who provided the A/C service.  Explain every detail of what and why each thing he was checking. Did a complete service inside and out of both units that were related to the A/C unit. A pleasant person to have this interaction with. When done, he was sure I was completely satisfied.  I hope this review gets back to Sierra Pacific, a person that truly represents them well!!!!!<//Review>

Always on time and professional. Great people. They check out my solar for the pool twice a year. They installed initially in 2006 and have taken down when we replaced the roof in 2014. Only have had one problem, a clamp came last year from the sun most likely. Great service always!!!< /text>

Guy called on Sunday and said my house looked like it had too many trees, and unless I called back he would not show up.  Left a message that I wanted to talk options anyway, that a lot of trees had been removed since the satellite picture was taken... he showed up at 11:30, without warning.  My wife told him to wait 10 minutes while I left work to come meet him.  I showed up and he had left already.  I called, and he said he would have waited if he'd known I was coming home (he knew).  He gave reason after reason NOT to do the project.  My pool pump was too old.  My roof was too steep.  It was too hard to trench.  They had an 8-week wait time.  It would be too expensive.  Pool is too big with too many trees.  Too far for them to drive.  Etc..

My pool is 80 degrees in the peak of the summer, with no heater.  It is 70 degrees in June and Sept.  I wanted to know whether I could get 10 more degrees in June and Sept, or how long I might extend the season, and how much it might cost.  He asked NOTHING, did no math, took no measurements, had no discussion, just left.  The lady at the office said they had options of using gas partially, and that the technician would discuss with me.  Nope, just left and flip-flopped on the phone over and over between "I don't want to do it" and "It's impossible" and "you'll have to wait too long" and "it will cost you too much".</review><Rate>1</Rate><user_name>Chris Themelis< /user_name><Gmap_id>0x809ae78653e1ae55:0xc1af10384c3548b9</Gmap_id>< Date>

<Review>I called twice to set up an appointment and was only able to leave a message. I left a message, no one called me back. I sent an online inquiry for service, no one contacted me back. I called a third time, got a service member on the phone, we scheduled the appointment. The day before the appointment I got the confirmation call of service between 3-7pm on a Sunday. Service person never showed up. Worst contact system and service ever. This was for a pool solar heater system repair. No shows and no contacts.

Edit: in response to your reply... I have already reached out 4 times in various different ways, times, and days, to meet your company's needs in setting up a service call. You say call you directly but leave no contact information or directions to reach you.
At this point, if you really wanted me as a customer, I would hope you would be doing everything in your power to find my service file in your system and take initiative to make amends. You will hopefully find it under Shalon Warner. I have more than done my due diligence as a customer to try to obtain service, giving Sierra Pacific more than enough benefit of the doubt. Now, it's your turn to reach out if you really want my business added to your 5000 PSAs.<//Review>< Pics>

I bought my Home Solar over 13 years ago and the Pool Solar before that! No matter the issue or concern I have, their team is there to help.  They do not push to sell something and yet have always worked with me to resolve an issue.  Trust me, it isn't just about them making money.  They listen, compromise and analyze and end up performing a great service.  Thank you to Naomi, Eric and the whole team at Sierra Pacific.< /Text>

I was very happy with Sierra Pacific. They have a knowledgeable and professional team. Unlike some of their competitors, they didnât try to sell a new system. They took time in explaining they issues. I will not hesitate in recommending them to others.</text>

<review>I first learned of Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort, Inc., through Costco.  I have experienced other repair/installer service providers and have had mixed reviews with them, though I will not mention their names, due to limited exposure to them (1 to 3 interactions with each of those I met).  With Sierra Pacific, it was shocking.  I had built a perception of some give and take when discussing and negotiating for a new installation, given my previous experiences with other companies; But, design specialist, Michael Wadman, made it a straight forward approach with honesty and knowledgeable information.  After meeting the installation crew, Anthony, Daniel, Aurelio, and Brett, my understanding of the company culture started to solidify with confidence that my decision to have them install a machine was  sound.  Their support staff members such as Elaina and Corrine reinforced my my decision with courteous and patient service.  At the end of the installation, I was more than satisfied with the service and equipment they installed.  I would also like to thank Costco for referring me to them.  Through Costco, there are other benefits that are received.  I will not go over these at this time as they may differ as time progresses, but it just adds to the already great service and equipment that was received.  Sincerely, Drew Chandler<//review><rate>5<//rate><Gmap_id>0x809ae78653e1ae55:0xc1af10384c3548b9</Gmap_id>< user_name>

We had a water leak with unknown origin involving our pool, pool equipment or solar pool equipment. Pool person said it was not from the pool equipment. Called Sierra Pacific for Solar equipment. Garon showed up on time, took a look at the leak and took it upon himself to contact the pool equipment company to investigate the source of and electrical line in the leaking conduit. Followed it back to a remote control in the pool spa which had become displaced by recent tile cleaning. It was siphoning water out of the spa because it was half below water surface, only when the filter was on. We were so grateful it wasnât a leak under the concrete or something that we gladly paid the service call and time even though it was not the solar. Great service!!< /Text>

We have been customers of Sierra Pacific for the past 2 years now.  I'm updating my review to let you know how good the quality and service really is. 2 months after our warranty was over we experienced a mechanical issue. Sierra Pacific came out, diagnosed, and returned with replacement part and after reviewing our service agreement, they informed me they would cover the part and labor.  I will say my extended service agreement possibly helped with this service agreement but at the end of the day they saved me hundreds of dollars, thank you!< /text>

<Review>Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort installed a HVAC system in my house.  I called three other HVAC companies and they could not compare with the price I received. My design specialist Gary did a great job explaining options and cost.  He was very upfront and no pressure.  The installation crew (Anthony, Mike M and Brett) were very professional and did an awesome job removing the old unit  and installing the new unit.  They were very detailed oriented. They even helped me shovel snow so they could get the truck up the driveway.  A couple weeks after the installation there was a power surge and it blew a transmitter.  Brad came by on short notice and fixed it without charge.    From start to finish it was a great experience and I would use them again.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>When your water heater goes out just before the weekend, the last thing you want to do is place calls for quotes and have the companies you are working with go radio silent through the weekend.

Thatâs exactly what happened to me, with the exception of one company, Sierra Pacific. Jeff, a design specialist with Sierra made a trip to our house the next day (Friday), and continued to work with me through the weekend, even though I could tell he was off. When he discovered that the tankless unit I wanted was not the brand they carry, he and his team agreed to purchase that unit anyway, making me a happier customer. Hunter, their Design Engineer, was out the next day to ensure that all the specs were known and I received a quote. They understood that we were without hot water and their actions made us feel we were a priority.

By early the next week, Kyle and Dylan, the Installation Specialists, were at the house working. They checked the boxes of what you would expect; a call 30 minutes out, on time, kept the workspace clean, good communication with an inquisitive home owner, and a check in before they left the property.

Kyleâs attention to detail was phenomenal, and the gas line work, the plumbing work, and the installation of the Tankless water heater work all look great and were done at a competitive price. Dylan walked me through the functions of the Tankless, what app to download, and its use. Extra kudos to Kyle, who came by the house the day after the installation because I had some questions.

I asked Sierra Pacific to bid on the project because they did such a great job on our HVAC replacement a few years ago. They exhibit the same level of customer service detail they did back then, and because they did not set me adrift over the weekend, and came in near other bids in the end, I am certainly happy I made the choice to go with them.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7jzuAxHHua4k-9F-wIDgJu1ajZ056hrLaloOb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqh6IVjn04EYDdjLqGuheKlEUUTb_NRO3UXizP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>{'time': 1616535383993, 'text': "David, thank you for sharing the experience you had with my team - I'm grateful to have you as a client and appreciate your recognition of the professionals at Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort.

Kyle and Abraham did a great Job with the installation, they were very dedicated in ensuring quality work and to finish the job timely. The ordered Air handler base would not fit and they had to construct a base on site to accommodate( Construction was State of the Art).

Paul returned to my home to complete the installation of fuse and grill. He was very friendly and knowledgeable of the business. He went above and beyond in taking care of us.

Great Job Paul, Kyle and Abraham!  your company is blessed to have you,  people like you will take your company to greater heights.

Keep up the good work ALL.</review>< pictures>

Daniel and Anthony did the install, were incredibly professional, respectful, and got the job done on schedule as promised. Would 100% recommend.< /review>

<text>They did not show within the 2 hour window time given. I had to call to see what was going on. They said service person had fallen behind. Would have been nice to have been informed (courtesy call) of the no show. Approximately 2.5 hours after the original 2 hour window the service person finally showed.<//text>< Date>

Design Specialist, Jeff Baker, explained exactly what the installation of my tankless hot water system would entail and how the unit would work for me.  He gave me a very reasonable price quote.  Just a few days later, the installation team of Anthony, Daniel and Aurelio  worked steadily and carefully to remove my old water tank, pipes, etc and install a new Tankless Hot Water Heater system.  Anthony showed me and explained how it works and made sure I was comfortable with the information.  They are all very professional, neat and courteous - a pleasure to do business with.< /Review>

Our package unit on the roof was replaced with a new Lennox system by a great team at Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort.  We found them by going through Costco.  Our sales rep, Joji, was on time, professional, and didn't try to upsell more than we needed.  A technician came a few days before the install to ensure we purchased the right size unit for the size and ducting in our house (we actually down-sized!).  The install crew showed up on time and went right to work, led by Jose Romo.  His team, including Daniel Simunovich and Aurelio Torres, were great!  They worked non-stop and ensured that our ducts were sealed and around all vents, the roof was braced, shingles replaced (and matched), kept us informed about the crane schedule, and double-checked that all was working properly before leaving.  Both days, everything was cleaned up, including vacuuming the carpet, before they left.  The crane operator was incredible, maneuvering between power lines and trees - I was in aww.  I cannot say enough about everyone at Sierra Pacific H&C, including Koren at the office, who was wonderful to work with.  Thank you Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort!  You have a great team who does top-notch work!< /Text>

When the service guy  came to do maintenance and replace filter. He got the wrong filter so he said heâll be back 20 mins. 1 1/2 hrs later he finally got the right size but charged me another $100 more then they quoted me. I donât think ill use this company next time. Overcharged and wasted my day off sitting around waiting for the service guy.< /Text>

< Review>
Start to finish I am wondering why we haven't been using Sierra Pacific for years!  Literally from the fist conversation 2 wks in we are sitting in a toasty warm home.  We took the recommendation of friends and contacted SP through Costco.  From the first conversation to the final sign off this has been an amazingly seamless experience.   Our Sales Professional Dominic listened, providing us detailed recommendations/options and pricing.  Not once did we feel as through we were being "up sold" on equipment.  Though the design process and minor modification made to the contract communication has been stellar.
And then the Red Truck arrived .... Kyle B, Jose and Dylan ... what can I say.  This was not a simple job .... complete replacement of HVAC and duct work.  Hard to imagine but they made it almost fun.  It was obvious that they knew what they were doing, but they also enjoyed working together.   It was loud and dirty and hectic and cold, but somehow they made it entertaining.  Team Kyle showed up promptly, worked hard all day and continued to clean up throughout the process.  We feel like the winners the in HVAC lottery.  Thanks Sierra Pacific ... job very well done!  And i am still wondering why we stayed with the "other guy" for so long :(<//Review>

<text>I contracted Sierra Pacific through Costco for a complete new HVAC system.  Salesman Jonji was clear, informative and polite.  He simply took information about our needs and expectations and then made recommendations without a strong arm sales approach.  A few days contracting Hunter came out to do a site visit.  He, too, was polite, informative and efficient.  Then a week later Brad and his crew came to install.  They got straight to work, each seemingly knowing exactly his role.  They intentionally made sure our heating was up and running before they left that first day .  The next day they essentially completed the install with the exception of a trim piece and minor exterior painting that Paul took care of a few days later.  Each of the individuals involved were professional, pleasant and seemed to be well trained (including the office staff on the phone).  They prepared themselves and our house for the work (to prevent damage) and always left it clean.  All involved showed up on time for each step.  The effects of the new Lennox system were immediately felt.  Much quieter and smoother operation.  The condenser unit outside is half as noisy as the prior unit.  Many of my neighbors have been replacing their units (all about the same age) and chose to go with a smaller family run company popular in our community.  I specifically chose to go with Sierra Pacific because I wanted a larger company that had the Costco affiliation (and associated reputation to uphold) and that had a better chance of still being in business 20+ years from now.  I also wanted a company that seems to train and retain their craftsmen instead of routinely hiring off the street.  In other words I wanted skilled, competent staff to do the install and whom I can count on to be there in the future should I have any problems.  Sierra Pacific seemed to fit the bill.  I know that even top-rated equipment, if not properly installed can cause a lot of problems.  I feel that Sierra Pacific knows their products and how to properly install them.  Our experience with them so far has been great.  I hope it continues through the years. Would not hesitate recommending them.<//text>< username>

Don came out to preview the site and explain and offer solutions to my problem.  Next came Hunter (great guy!) for the site evaluation.  All good so far, even with what I thought would be issues.  On the day of install I received a courtesy call that my techs Brad G and Ross G were on the way.  Cleanest install ever, and no disruption to my business. Great communication every step of the way, and no surprises.

Juan M and his crew did a great job removing my old AC system and installing a new one! It was not an easy job, with everything in the attic, above the 3rd story. They were professional and worked hard to clean things up afterwards.< /Text>

Sierra Pacific has always been top notch for my solar pool heating.  I have had them install 3 systems over the years as I moved and upgraded.  Their service personnel are well trained.  I have found that my concerns are always satisfied quickly from office staff to tech. Thanks!< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>We were super pleased with Sierra Pacific Home Comfort when they completed the installation of our Mitsubishi mini-splits. We really canât say enough good things about their service and professionalism. Firstly, the installation team of Anthony, Aurelio, and Daniel were fantastic. They were extremely courteous and knowledgeable, worked efficiently and completed the significant installation in two days. When finished, everything was neat and clean. Sierra Pacific also made the pre-installation process just great. Dominic was extremely helpful and knowledgeable in finding the right system, and completing the estimate for the project. When we were ready for the pre-installation site visit, Hunter was equally helpful and knowledgeable about the installation details.  We extend our sincere thanks to this professional team for your exceptional service. We highly recommend Sierra Pacific Home Comfort!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>From beginning to end this company has scored high marks in my book. When you are looking at spending a good amount of money on your heating and air system you want to know that you are in good hands. Sales helped me feel confident that I was making the right choice for the square footage of my home. Installers troubleshooted every quirky aspect of my home structure and treated my home as if it was their own,  and the maintenance team.... I can't say enough about them. They are super friendly and very very helpful. I will be a lifelong Sierra Pacific customer.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>We scheduled a tune-up and replacement of filter for our HVAC.  After changing the filter our AC stopped working.  The technician could not fix it.  We went 2 days without AC.  When they fixe the AC, they wanted to charge a "diagnostic fee" and still charged for the "tune-up".
I was left with the impression that some of their technicians were not particularly competent and the company did not hold customer satisfaction as a priority.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

01/08/21  We are disappointed with the follow thru after the initial installation.  We contracted for a Merv 16 Healthy Climate filter and on the last day of install we were informed that no one in CA had that filter in stock.  Well here we are 2 months later and a trip to the attic shows that we still have the Merv 10 filter.  Called the office and informed them of the filter that we had and then gave them the part number of the one that  should have installed and magically they can install it next week.  My suggestion is that the person who is coordinating the installations take time to review all the items in the contract and verify they are in stock BEFORE scheduling a day with the home owner.  Also, in order to meet their 2 day installation deadline the crew didn't have time to put some of the insulation back to it's original location and they didn't have time to use a magnet on a stick to cleanup some of the screws and nails in the attic.  The garage and driveway areas were left as clean as when they arrived and I thanked the crew for that.
11/02/20 We are very happy with our new heating and air- conditioning system installed by Anthony, Aurelio, & Daniel.  Our house is now the same temperature thru out the house since we moved in several months ago.  Michael our salesperson listened to our needs and designed a system to meet them.  The crew was punctual each day and were pleasant & knowledgeable to be around & they wore their mask the whole time & shoe covers in house the house, and cleaned up at the end of each day.  Thanks<//Text>

<Review>On Wednesday January 13, Matt and Lucas showed up at 8:30am to install my new water heater. They were wearing covid PPE and introduced themselves.  We proceeded to the garage where the old water heater was located. They asked if it was ok for them to get started, as they would soon be turning off the water and then the gas.
They worked  extremely well together, and in 4 hours, or so, were finished. They even allowed me to paint the wall before they put the new water heater into place (I had the paint ready and hope it didnât hold them up).  Those two men were very polite to my wife and me, and to each other. It was obvious to me that they work to high standards.<//Review><Date>1610680533819< /Date><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

Last year, Sierra Pacific installed solar panels on our garage to help raise the temperature in our swimming pool. After 18 years without solar, we are enjoying the pool now more than ever.

Without question, Sierra Pacific is a terrific company. There's a lot of competition in the home improvement industry and sometimes it is real difficult to find an exceptional company that is honest, stands behind their product, offers a fair price, and maintains a highly trained, competent, and professional work crew. Sierra Pacific, in my experience, ranks at the top in it's field.

From the telephone receptionists to the equipment installers, and from the service technicians to management, we have been treated fairly and courteously. Over the last year, we needed some adjustments in our solar panel operation. Sierra Pacific responded quickly and solved the problems. Sierra Pacific knows their business well and repeatedly comes through.

One additional note: Jeff Buckley, a design technician, came out to the house earlier this week to address a minor problem with our solar system. He quickly diagnosed the issue, fixed it, and then went beyond what I expected by closely examining the entire system. He was thorough, professional, and very capable. Sierra Pacific is lucky to have him on board.

I highly recommend this outstanding company.</text>

Every interaction with Sierra Pacific has been professional, prompt, and easy from our first phone call to the final installation of our HVAC system. We want to give a special shout out to Don, Hunter, Javier, and Mike #2 for the many ways you went out of your way to answer our questions, prepare us for the next step, and take care of our HVAC needs. Today is Thanksgiving and Javier and Mike worked into the evening yesterday to insure we would have heat before they left. Jason, as the owner of SP, it is clear you have built a company that not only provides an excellent product, but also stellar customer service.</text>

They had installed a new mini split system in my home. The tech that came out for routine maintenance had somehow busted a fan blade inside the unit when checking the temperature. He wore a face mask and offered to wear gloves inside our home.  They were quick to send someone out when I called about the issue. The second tech who came out did not seem to have a very secure face mask and did not offer to wear gloves. It's hit or miss but they are responsive.<//text>

Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort crew installed a new hot water heater. The crew showed up on time as scheduled. They were very professional and answered all of my questions. Both had a very good understanding of the product. Post installation, they explained how to set the temperature gauge and what to do in the event of any problems. I highly recommend using Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort's services.<//Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>The salesperson arrived on time and conducted an inspection of our 15 year old solar pool heating system. He correctly determined it was beyond repair and provided quote.

I feel certain Sierra Pacific would have done a good job but their quote as about 100% higher than another reputable installer. For instance, SP quoted removal of the old unit was $675 and the other company quoted $250. Also, I was advised there could be other charges once the project was underway.

Seems Sierra Pacific is so busy due to everyone staying home this COVID Summer that they can make a huge profit off those who do not do comparison shopping.< /Review>< Pictures>

In addition to performing a quality installation, they were, at all times professional and courteous and thoroughly cleaned up daily.

My name is Joe, and I live in Yuba City California. Carlos came and installed my Easy Touch PL -4 to my pool pump to heat my pool.  He did a very professional job and explained everything as he went as to what he was doing, and why he was doing it. After he was done and gone, I had a few questions and I called. He called me back right away and answered all my questions and took me through everything, step-by-step. By doing this it was easier for me to understand how the system worked.  This way, I understood why the settings were the way they were and how they operated. I give Carlos a five star rating for a job well done.     Thanks< /text>

We had pool solar installed last week. The install crew was punctual and spent the day installing the solar equipment and keeping me updated on their progress. Tyler, Devin, and Ryan were extremely professional and Tyler did a great job going over the operation of the solar system and how to winterize the system and do the reverse at the beginning of the season. I waited a few days to see if the system worked properly and it has definitely made a big difference in our pool temperatures. My kids and I were able night swim over the weekend because the pool so heated up high enough for us to enjoy the pool.</Text>

I went into this office to get an estimate on an A/C repair I needed and I was appalled! They are not requiring masks and by what I saw, cannot effectively social distance! They have absolutely no excuse to not be wearing masks! I saw them all interacting when I went in. I wouldn't want to work there! I most certainly will not be using their services. I highly recommend you examine whether or not they should be allowed to serve the public with the blatant disregard for the safety of their employees and by extention, customers. This place is very bad!

Thank you, please wear a mask, please social distance, and please stay safe!</Text>

Sales staff was great, but then again they don't control the customer service. Its been three weeks and still no duct test report. I can't call for inspection without it. Of coarse the Building department ins closed anyway.
It took two days instead of one for the install, because the first crew had a bit of trouble with the sheet metal.  I have to admit they made it right with a second more professional installer. The system is now in and works very well.< /review>

We have a built in pool that was having communication issues thru the Hayward ProLogic Controller. Sierra Pacific has had for years our annual contract for the pools solar heating system and they do the yearly start-up & shut down of the system. When I noticed the error codes showing this week on my controller, I called SP to come repair it. Their tech Martin quickly diagnosed the system accurately and found a loose wire causing the error. Instead of us thinking it was a major component failure with a heavy cost, no, instead it was a quick and easy fix. I suggest you use Sierra Pacific for your pool equipment service requirements = well done!<//text>

<text>Sierra Pacific installed a water heater in my home.  The sales rep was polite, honest and attained the best deal possible for a quality system.  It was installed the following day, on schedule, by an outstanding team.  Andrew and Matt made sure the installation was to code, neat and orderly.  They cleaned up afterwards and left the job site immaculate.

You may pay a little more for Sierra Pacific to do the job, but the courtesy, punctuality, and professionalism of the office staff, sales and installation teams is well worth it.  This is the fourth job I have contracted with Sierra Pacific; solar electric, solar pool heater, windows and sliding doors,  and now a water heater.  The experience was exactly the same - outstanding from beginning to end.  I can't tell you how nice it is to have confidence that you are dealing with a first class, reputable company.  Also, having six years of experience with them, I can tell you their service after the install is excellent.  Any issues are resolved quickly to my satisfaction.  If there was a rating above 5 stars, they would get it.</text><user_name>David Trask<//user_name>< Rating>

The whole process from meeting Kyle Bentley and Abraham S. to installing and finishing the installation of our HVAC was awesome!. They are very professional and know what needs to do.  Due to health issues and treatments going on in our home, these two gentlemen worked diligently  as scheduled to have our HVAC working so we can have cooling air in the house!! They went above and beyond doing what is best, is to meet the need of whomever (like us) to help through their Company, Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort, Inc. Our recommendation and thanksgiving for a well done job Kyle and Abraham!! Keep-up the Good Work.</text>

While diagnosing my AC issue he took the time to appreciate the awesomeness of my cat, which my cat much appreciated. After determining what the problem was, he took the time to explain what was happening and what could be done to correct it. When all work was done he picked up his work area and asked if there was anything else. He was prompt, courteous and professional.

Eric Wirth has been out twice, first time to perform gateway install. While doing the install he found a failing component in control unit and also found that one of our panels was not working. But the biggest issue he found was that our control unit was "going to sleep" and not producing electricity as it should. He fixed the last problem immediately and ordered warranty replacement parts for the other two issues. Once parts arrived, he came back, about 10 days later and installed them. Eric is very knowledgeable and goes the extra mile to find and fix problems. He is a friendly and personable tech and was a joy to work with. We are looking forward to improved functioning of our system. I would highly recommend Sierra Pacific and Eric without reservation. John Santos< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Costco contracts with Sierra Pacific for HVAC systems. My sales rep, Gary listened to my demands and expectations and proceeded to put together a quote on the spot - everything clearly outlined and explained. My wife and I decided to proceed to have Sierra Pacific replace our 20 year old systems. The next step - digitallt sign docs was a breeze and then setting up a schedule for an preinstall inspection occured.
The day before the appointment, SP called to remind me that they would be at my house the next morning and they did. 20 minutes before 8am, I receieved a call Brad, from the Lead for the team of three that they should be there soon. And they were.
Everything was explained to me and how they would proceed for the 1st half of my two units to be replaced. After papers were signed, they worked diligently and efficiently.
I would HIGHLY recommend working through Costco and with Sierra Pacific for any HVAC, Solar, window, repair work. All three on the team: Brad, Ross and Matt were a peasure to meet and recognize pride of work well done!<//Review>< pictures>

We have been long time Sierra Pacific pool solar customers. We installed our pool solar around 2003. For many years, we have been happy customers
as Sierra Pacific had taken good care of us. For the last 2 years, their pool solar support fees have gotten so high, they are losing this customer
forever. Last spring, we contacted them about replacing a solar sensor on the roof. This part goes out every 3-4 years.Their minimum service fee is
now $198, just to come out to the house. This is the highest minimum service fee I have ever heard of, and is exorbitant for the services provided.
Then the price of the sensor was $198. This is a simple sensor I can find for less than $50 in multiple sites.

This year we requested them to come out to fix a different part on the roof. Again another $198 solar service fee for the trip, and $298 for the
part which I can find for less than $40. I declined this outrageous pricing and will replace the item myself. Then when the service technician left our
property, he damaged a new concrete curbing we just had poured. That repair will cost another $150, and Sierra Pacific will not return my call about
their responsibility to pay for it. I immediately called as soon as I saw the damage and left a voice message for the service manager. I called agin
24 hours later after I didn't receive a call back. I then called a third time another 24 hours later and still no call back as promised.

I have no idea what changed in the last 2 years, but their pool solar support value has gone dramatically downhill.

Due to their inability to take responsibility for the damage, and their outrageous support costs, they have driven us away for good.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1589468084023, 'text': "Hi Chuck, it pains me to see your message, I talked with our Service Manager because I know that she already spoke to you. I hope that her work to resolve this would cause you to revise your review of our company. As you know from the many years of service we pride ourselves on being a reliable and trustworthy company. We work so hard to train our craftsmen to do this specialty solar work in a safe and competent manner. There is not a training school to hire people who are capable of this work, every solar pool technician is 100% trained by our experienced managers. Moreover the rules for the work place in California have driven up the cost of running and maintaining a service truck and the people doing the work. As such there is a high cost to train and keep the experts that our clients really like and trust. I'm proud of the friendly and honest character of our team and it takes a tremendous investment in them for our company to be able to serve our clients with the high standards we are known for. I do hope we get an opportunity serve you again.\nRespectfully,\nJason Hanson\nPresident"}<//Response>

Gabriel, Matt and Avrelio did a great job. They worked hard and fast, were thorough and were very good about cleaning up after themselves. They went above and beyond what I expected and were very responsive to questions and concerns.

The Design Specialist was decent until we were told that we actually didn't qualify for a last minute deal we were promised. This was very disappointing as we had to pay the entirety of the contract up front for this deal so there was a little bit of financial pressure on our end. When we were told a day later that we didn't qualify for said deal, we asked what Sierra Pacific was going to do to make this mistake right as it was a $750 value we were losing out on. Their response was that the company would not do anything and if we wanted to cancel that is fine "there are 50 other people wanting installs, so it is completely up to you".  At the end of the day we were still receiving more work for our money compared to other quotes we received and we kept our contract with them (minus the $750).  The technicians were amazing, we now have a fantastic HVAC system, however the Company did not make me feel as though my business mattered to them.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< Review>
I've been using Sierra Pacific each year since they installed my pool's solar heating in 2013. At the start of every swim season I have had to call them to repairs leaks in the solar collectors. The service techs they have sent out are professional and quickly diagnose the problem and repair it, as well as checking other components of the system for leaks. I would have given Sierra Pacific 5 stars for this review, but for each of this year's 2 service calls, they have quoted me $198 for the in-warranty repairs, instead of the $97 charge I have paid every year before this. After reminding them that this is a 105% increase over previous years, and this is an in-warranty repair and not a full service, they have agreed to charge the standard $97.< /Review>

Every year the cost to train our service team on safe practices, new technology, and increased compliance protocols is something we are contending with. As you can see, we offer significant discounts to our Planned Service clients and I encourage you to take advantage of this program.

{'time': 1610740774752, 'text': 'N G, I think maybe you have the wrong company here. Panasonic panels are the top rated panel in North American with an amazing warranty, so they are not cheap products. Which is why I think you may have confused our company with another company. Regarding Return On Investment (ROI) with solar - it varies by your utility company, your rate structure you are on with electric rates, how much energy you use, and how easy (or difficult/costly) it is to install solar and connect to your electric panel at your home. Many PG&E customers have about an 8 year payback time. Customers in other utilities have 20-30 year payback time. There are so many variables, so we always recommend an on-site visit from one of our trained and experienced Design Specialists. Then you can make the best decision for your situation. It sounds like maybe you were not a good candidate for solar. I wish you well.\nJason Hanson\nPresident'}</Resp>

<Review>Never use them. They sell you one thing then say they have to change to another. Then you find out it doesnât work the way it should.

<review>We had called Sierra Pacific to give us a quote to install a solar pool heater.. they give an appointment more than a week later.. I was already surprised because all other companies came the very next morning and within 10 min got a quote.. we kind of already fixed who we will go with and today is the 2nd day after the promised day off quote.. no one has shown up. We were supposed to confirm our quote with the other vendor last week but just thought of waiting for Sierra. I think these reviews are all paid because a company with this much rating will not do this. Highly disappointed!!!</review>< rating>

Sierra Pacific has a great product and their installation team of Brad Greenwell and Matt Hamilton were amazing!  Very professional, knowledgeable, skilled, courteous and efficient!  Went above and beyond to complete the installation and they made sure they cleaned up each day.  Highly recommend Sierra Pacific and Brad and Matt.  Job well done!</review>

I had 3 FAFCO Solar panels replaced today. My original appointment for March was postponed due to the shut down, but Sierra Pacific was great when I called to reschedule the work to get my pool going again. My technician, Bob, was a great guy. Got here on time, finished the job efficiently and helped me by explaining some things I had questions about. Overall, another great experience with Sierra Pacific Home and Comfort!

I got solar through them and my bill is actually more than what it was prior to not having solar. Very misleading advertisement.  I asked how solar increases the value of my home and how having solar is better than the stock market and have yet to get an explanation. I cannot refinance my home now. Honestly, because my home is on the smaller side and a little out dated I would have probably benefited more from having new windows and doors installed and for a fraction of the price. But making 3 times as much on solar is more lucrative is my guess. I would not use them for anything. Dishonest and misleading promises by Mr. Hanson.</review>

From sales to installation we were delighted with the service.  All of the teams where on time, patient, respectful, knowledgeable and no high pressure sales.  HVAC replacement is a big expense, but with the Costco and PGE rebates we were able to get a high efficiency system for a good price.  Very happy with Sierra Pacific and would recommend them.    They make it very easy to do business with.  Thanks SP!< /Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Holly Fong</user_name><Text>Francisco, Fernando and Hector installed our new HVAC yesterday and finished today. Nice guys, all were introduced when they first got here. So glad the weather cooled down as those guys were going upstairs and into the attic all day long. They were clean, always covering up our stairs and clothes in closet, wearing show coverings etc. Really hard workers! Francisco, the lead, frequently updated us on the progress of the job and any issues encountered (there were none). He explained all the new connections and things they replaced. So patient with us in setting up the new thermostat and waited until we got the wifi connected. Explained all the paperwork and took the time to verify with the office regarding a small change to the contract. Overall we are very, very satisfied with these guys.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>My wife and I have been customers of Sierra Pacific for many years. We have ALWAYS received excellent service from Sierra Pacific's employees. Everyone we have encountered has always been professional, polite, friendly and helpful.

However, This week, Nick came to our home to service our pool solar system which had developed a few leaks. As I explained, their employees have already set a very high bar of customer service and satisfaction for us. I am pleased to say that Nick exceeded even that high standard and went above and beyond. He was everything I mentioned, professional, polite, friendly and helpful and technically very proficient, and MORE.

Thank you to Nick and the Sierra Pacific team for taking care of our service needs. We highly recommend them for your needs. Jon & Barbara<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

<Review>We been having bad luck w/ our AC system for the past years.  First, when we bought our new house, the AC unit that was built from the builder was too small and weak, which lasted for about 8 yrs. Then we upgrade a little bigger from an AC tech. guy, and that lasted only 5 yrs. One day, we pass by Costco and see that they also provide AC services.  Sierra Pacific Solar, Heating & Air Service is affiliated w/ Costco at the time. Overall, Costco is very picky of who they connect or associate with bc of their brand name is on the line.  Thus, I give it shot and try them.  In short, from the beginning process to the end, all the workers from Sierra Pacific, ranging from the secretary, design specialist (Joji/John), installers (Anthony, Aurelio, & Michael Montana), and everyone else were absolutely fantastic.  All positive and nothing to complain about. I really appreciate and hands down to all the installers, who were working on my house all day installing new and complete AC and Heating System in 100 degrees weather...working non-stop diligently for 2 days straight. The AC is working great. Finally, my family and I get to experience a true AC feeling from now on. Worth the money and necessary for my family health.  Strongly recommend Sierra Pacific to anyone. Thx you very much.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Did what I had asked for in a punctual, friendly and professional way.  David, the technician was very nice and I feel he is trustworthy and I'd be glad to have him back.
The only reason why I gave only 4 stars is that they came out to check everything and that is what I paid for.  But then the charge for replacing the capacitor was an additional $289.00 (Amazon: $8.09);  $80 I wouldn't have said anything - but I know from experience, they all overcharge on those items.  Kind of a downer.< /Review>

In regards to the parts, I will share that the price to provide those are a combination of the price the distributor charges (which has inventory and handling costs), plus tax and shipping which we have to pay. Plus we inventory many parts on our trucks so that you can get the repair done in a rapid fashion, which has a carrying cost. More important and more substantial than the cost of the part is the cost of training a Service Professional. In addition to the investments we make to constantly train our team in technical skills, we expect high level of service so that you receive people in your home that you find to be trustworthy, friendly, and who will treat you and your home with respect. To deliver high level of service on all these things is important to our clients, so we invest to make sure that you get this experience and have friendly technicians that you will like and trust to do work with great craftsmanship.

<GmapID>0x809ae78653e1ae55:0xc1af10384c3548b9</GmapID><review>We had Sierra Pacific install our home electric and pool solar and we also have a maintenance agreement with them.   We are very pleased with their service these last few years.  Today Nicholas K. came to service our HVAC system and he was the nicest man.  He put on shoe covers and a mask and took time to explain everything to us in a way that was easy for us to understand.  He was so thorough and helpful about our options for either replacement of some parts or to purchase a new system.  There was absolutely no pressure to buy a new system.  We were extremely impressed with not only his professionalism and expertise but he was truly a great guy to talk to.  We would definitely recommend Sierra Pacific and we want to commend their employee Nicholas K.

UPDATE!!  With the excellent help of Don the design consultant, we decided to go with a new system.  We are so happy with Sierra Pacific and the way our new HVAC system is working. We bought the XC20 and you absolutely do not hear this system! It just works silently in the background. No more jumping up and down to go to the thermostat to adjust it. No more warm and cold spots in the house. No more noise waking you up at night as the AC cycles on. It works with Alexa as well as other platforms. You can adjust the temperature on your phone and your computer. IT JUST WORKS PERFECTLY! And the outside unit is quiet as well. We didn't even know it was on until we walked up right near it. Gabriel and Matt were our installers and they did a magnificent job and kept the house totally clean throughout the process. Gabriel was back the second day and he was a great guy and a very hard worker. I can't imagine what it must have been like to work in an attic on a 100 degree day, but he always gave us a smile when he came down from the attic. We just want to thank Sierra Pacific and all of their wonderful employees who take care of our house solar, pool solar and now our brand new wonderful HVAC system.<//review><name>Barbara</name>< Date>

<Text>We so appreciate that kind of integrity and highly recommend them. The main reason we chose Sierra Pacific is because that would only mean one company on our roof doing both of our pool water solar and our whole house electric PV systems and would avoid any challenge with two different companies and therefore if anything ever went wrong then one company might blame the other.

Having only one company on our roof to do all of our systems we believe was a great choice

They have responded to every problem professionally and promptly. About two years ago we had a short in one of our PV panels and it took a couple of days to find the problem since we have 60 panels. They replaced the inverter and also replaced the burned-out panel. Our new inverter has now developed a rare problem and they are replacing it for us under its warranty.

Our technician was Eric Wirth. What a great guy and very quickly found the problem. Anyone that has him to their home during these crazy times will be as pleased as we are.

Gabriel and Matt installed our new HVAC system. I cannot say enough good things about these two gentlemen. They are a good team and did their work very efficiently. Both were very personable, timely, and cleaned up as work progressed to keep the mess to a minimum.  On a warm day our attic is miserably hot where HVAC is located, but they just kept moving and working. They did a very nice job and everything was as clean as when they arrived. Gabriel went over the controls and helped to connect to phone and internet making the system operation very easy to learn. The final inspection passed with no issues and I think in part due to Sierra Pacific's good reputation which gave me some comfort that I chosen the right team.<//text>

<name>Staci Johnson</name>< Review>
So I need to have some tubing replaced on the roof's pool solar because of the pesty squirrels and Sierra Pacific now wants to charge me $198 just to drive to my house and take a look. If they find leaks, and they will, that is why I need them to come out, they want to then charge me another $89 for up to 5 leaks.  What a rip off.  Travel and gas do not cost that much.  Had service done 5 years ago and I do expect an increase in price but double the price that is r
Time to find another service.< /Review>

Sierra Pacific HVAC install has been a 5 star experience for us. Highly qualified technicians who go the extra mile to please their customers. Paul K. came to our home for the final install of a custom return air grill and did a superb job. He was on time, meticulous in his workmanship, friendly and cleaned up to make everything look perfect. We highly recommend this company for your HVAC needs.</Review>

This is Kate Sommer, , Eric Wirth & Justin Borino fixed my house solar. This was a particularly difficult jobs since Sierra Pacific was not the company that installed my house solar. They were able to find the problem rather quickly I will work with no other company in the future except for Sierra Pacific each dealings I've had with Sierra Pacific have been professional knowledgeable and they've always fixed the problem. This is a great company , and Eric and Justin we're incredibly professional, knowledgeable and so friendly to deal with.</Text>

< Review>
We went through Costco and they paired us with Sierra Pacific. We had received a bid with another HVAC company prior to contracting with SP that was less $$ but we did not feel confident in what we were hearing from them.

The rep from SP, Tony, that showed up to do the initial quote was great. In fact we could very well have paid more because of his empathy, explanation and overall professionalism. We are good with that. Everything was explained extremely well and their were no surprises.

Tad came out to do our site inspection. He was a salty good ole boy! I appreciated his sincerity and honesty. He spent a lot of time taking a look at things then followed up with a confirmation of work to be performed.

Installation day came about a week to 10 days after we signed. Three guys showed up on Friday. Kevin, Nick & Carlos. They all were very kind and introduced themselves as soon as they got there. They worked all day Friday tearing out the old system and placing the new equipment. Saturday just Nick and Kevin returned I had the opportunity to chat with them while they worked, I had fun being the nosy home owner. These guys were great down to earth people.

There were a couple of snags during the install that were 100% fine. 1.) Light in our master bedroom closet was broken by their ladder. Kevin mentioned they would replace it. That has not happened yet, installation was four days ago so no surprise there. 2.) After the crew was done and gone I fired up the system to check airflow and figured out they had the zoning backwards. When I turned on the downstairs thermostat the upstairs air came on and vise versa. I called the installers and Nick, who was already home said he was coming back and would be here in 15 minutes. He was and it was fixed in five minutes. THIS IS WHERE SIERRA PACIFIC REALLY SHINED. It is understandable to make a mistake but the fact that Nick made it right so fast was amazing. Great job Nick, I really appreciate your efforts.

We have not yet had to use the system because, of course, right after install the weather is beautiful! We will and I am sure it will be great.

Give these guys a look. It is my opinion that they do cost more but you get what you pay for. I would do it all again.< /Review>

From the Design Specialist to the installation of my new HVAC unit, this company lives up to it's  excellent reputation. The installation crew Nick and Kevin were very professional and so friendly. They explained what they would be doing throughout the process and at the end went through the operation and setup of the wifi. They cleaned everything up and I couldn't  be happier with these guys. True excellence.< /Text>

Kyle Bentley and Kevin Campos installed the HVAC system in my home and did
an excellent job.  They were courteous and polite and explained things
and answered questions.  They also cleaned all the area and
took away all the old  materials.  They worked a long day and

the system seems to be working fine.  Thank you to  both of you..

I had a problem with starting my solar system on my pool. I called and was told I couldn't get service for about two weeks. Then I was told I would have to pay a travel charge because I was in Manteca. Turns out that I couldn't get service for about two weeks because that was the day they had for scheduling people in this area. So why was all the people serviced May 6th in our area charged a travel fe
e as if they were the only one being service out here. They should have taken the 5+ customers they serviced out here and spread out the travel charge instead of gouging all of us for a separate fee. Bad business if you ask me.<//Text>

David Munos did a terrific job of explaining how it all works, filter options etc and his conduct rates 5 stars.   We will not sign up for their continuing maintenance as the appointment booking process requires reserving a full day. We would if they booked 3-4 hour windows. Unbelievable lack of customer centric attitude.<//Review>

We are  long time customers of Sierra Pacific and our experiences with both field personnel and customer service has been exceptional.  It is a well run and professional organization that has provided quality products that they stand behind and maintenance and service that are timely and effective for any problems we have had with pool solar, solar power panels, and AC service.  There may be other companies that seem less expensive for equipment purchase and/or service contracts. The value of Sierra Pacific is evident when problems get resolved in such a timely manner to keep our home comfortable and everything running smoothly.

Update 5.19.19 - Carey came out to start up our solar pool heating system.  Very professional and knowledgeable.  He offered some suggestions about system settings if we needed to modify them on our own.

Update 6.10.20  David T. came to fix a leak in the panels and provided valuable (money saving) ideas about how the system could be programmed to work more efficiently and provided some information about supplemental heating options for Spring and Autumn.  He explains the functions of the systems in understandable language.  A great experience with a problem solved as well.</text>

Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort did a great job in installing a new HVAC Lennox system in our home. I would recommend Sierra Pacific as they are honest and price is fair and not overpriced. Sierra Pacific workers are courteous and respectful. During COVID 19 they all wore mask and shoe coverings and cleaned up after themselves and surprised me to see then even go further to wipe everything down with Clorox. Great team. Thanks again to Brad Greenwell, Matt Hamilton, Matt Troske, and Mike Montana.<//Review>

Had a whole house ductless heat pump system installed by Sierra Pacific. From start to finish this has been a great experience. The design and estimate was clearly explained. The scheduling was spot on. The crew was on time, kind, considerate, and hard working. They kept everything clean and neat. Everything is perfect. I can control heating and cooling in each room. All from my iPhone!  The system is so quiet!  And it lowers my home Greenhouse Gas emissions significantly! No more gas furnace.</Text>

On March 4, 2020, Joel S. provided a 29-point Tune up on the HVAC system we had installed September 30th of last year. This was the first of two complementary check-ups included in the cost of the system. Joel was on time, very polite, professional, and skilled. He explained his tasks clearly to me.<//text>

i would like to commend Savanna and Janele and the company.  Both were excellent listeners and worked hard to resolve my issues regarding the solar reinstallation on my roof. The company took a loss on my reinstallation and I appreciate all the help offered, plus the tech, MIchael, which I already posted my positive comments on him.  Thank you.<//review>

I have the yearly maintenance service and am very disappointed. They always give a 4 to 5 hour window when a technician will arrive and we always seem to be the very last appointment of the day, but end up wasting time waiting for service. This time we were stood up twice, even after we were promised they would be there for service the second day after missing our appointment the day before. We had a scheduled appointment last week, after waiting 4 hours with no phone call we called the customer service department and weâre told they were behind and wouldnât be able to make the appointment. We were re-scheduled to the next day and promised a technician would be there. Once again, no call, no show. We called the service department after waiting another 3 1/2 hours only to find the service department was closed. Needless to say, we are canceling our service. Do Not Use, they donât care about their customers!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1557864723526, 'text': 'Hi Marilyn, I apologize for the miscommunication here and also for the difficulty with the rain-days that have forced us to reschedule a tremendous amount of roof top solar work.

We have been pool solar customers since about 1999. We always appreciate the Sierra Pacific service dept. for their communication regarding the day-of schedule range, any unplanned changes (as happened today but it wasnât a problem at all) and their professional approach. Our service technician today was Michael and he was very polite, professional and took good care of our pool solar spring tune-up. Thanks, Sierra Pacific!< /text>

Thomas from Sierra Pacific came out and provided bids for taking our solar down for roof repair.  It is my experience that most companies don't have a clue what customer service really is let alone excellent customer service, but I can most certainly tell you Thomas exceeded all levels in providing excellent customer service!  He was polite, knowledgeable, extremely helpful and just pleasure to conduct business with. It was good news to find out he is returning today to perform the solar removal! Thank you Thomas!</review>

I wish the office had contacted me when the techs were on their way as promised (to make sure I was home and available)--but communication has been an issue in the past between the office, techs and customer. (Half a star deducted.)

But once Mike and David showed up, they were great! Mike checked the actuator on the solar set-up while David fearlessly climbed to the roof to check and restore a disrupted connection with the control box.

Turns out the 5-year-old actuator had a bad plastic O-ring. Once it cracked, it put a strain on the motor, which eventually burned out. Upon checking the price list, Mike found out the actuator replacement had been lowered from $695 to $465 (expensive for an O-ring, lol), but a big savings. And he added a discount on top of it if I had the repair done today rather than having to come back out in the spring, so Mike saved me over $200 which was sorely needed and greatly appreciated! (Half-star added back.)

(My main beef is with the actuator manufacturer, ComPool, for their measly, we-have-no-faith-in-our-product 3-year warranty. Every American car, truck and SUV comes with the same length, and vehicles are a lot more complex than a tiny actuator!! No stars for them.)

What made a big difference to me is that Mike wasn't a corporate robot or a rigid "here's our policy, screw you" type. He was genuine, personable, and sympathized with the customer--and THAT is something sorely lacking these days and is one of the reasons I have stayed with Sierra Pacific for this long. More techs like Mike (and David) are very appreciated!< /review>

< Review>
My furnace (Bryant Evolution 90i) was overheating and the local company I had used in the past was unable to address the issue.  I had worked with Sierra Pacific previously on a pool solar heating project and decided to call them regarding my furnace issue.  What a great experience that turned out to be!  The HVAC Tech, Kevin, quickly determined that the issue was due to an improperly sized and constructed duct system.

A follow-up meeting with Hunter, an HVAC Engineer resulted in a thorough  examination of my system and identification of the necessary changes.  I then received a quote from Hunter to perform the duct work upgrade and scheduled a date to have the work completed.

Two technicians (Gabrial Santibanez and Matt Troske) were assigned to my job and were able to complete all the necessary work in one day!  What an amazing difference in the way my system performs!  The system now moves much more air throughout the house and consequently requires less energy to meet our heating demands.

What a great experience it was to work with highly trained and skilled technicians that were customer focused and very professional at performing their jobs!< /Review>

< Review>
Long story short.
Had both solar and pool installed in 2012. Sierra talked us into a beta system at a discount to which we agreed. Jump ahead several years as California had a drought and we received little rain. In 2017 we got a few storms and had a leak develop right under the spot where they had installed the solar electrical. They claimed it was out of warranty and our problem. Fought with them back and forth until finally in 2018 they agreed to do a patch job on the roof, which failed. We had to contract out to a third party in order to repair the roof correctly. Inside our living room, under the damaged area, we now have an unsightly patch on the ceiling. Had Sierra warned us about any issues with our roof before installing, we could have had corrective measures done then. In my opinion, they just wanted the sale. Our roof is now at the point of needing to be replaced and now Sierra is artificially inflating the cost of temporarily removing the system and reinstalling it. The manager of the solar electrical needs to be fired.

In response to owners response: The leak in our roof is centered right under where the electrical solar was placed.

2020 update - we had our roof replaced and a third party solar company did both electric and pool for $3500 where Sierra wanted $9000 just for solar. SP is a bunch of Bastages.< /Review>

My offer for the special consideration for work still stands. I look forward to helping you complete this upgrade.\nKind Regards,\nJason Hanson'}<//resp>

<text>My husband and I researched many companies to upgrade our heating and air conditioning units in our home. Now that all work is completed, tested, and passed inspection, we agree that we're very happy with a job well done by the employees at Sierra Pacific. The service is spot on, from the first consultation, through the days of installing new units and duct work, and with the follow up ensuring we're happy with the outcome. Our home has never been so cool in summer! I wouldn't hesitate to call them again for another service.</text>< pics>

After 3 years of repeated repairs to the tune of $2,100 I decided to seek another company's intervention. Mind you I was told that the system was still in good shape. The last repair was performed after not having a functioning heat side on our heat pump last winter. I was told that the problem was a "bug" which was remedied and I was directed to purchase their silver plan. Not accustomed to having a mechanical bug. Decided to shop around instead. Recently ceased the silver plan and I'm moving on. Service was pleasant just not proficient.< /text>

<Text>Sierra Pacific has great products, great technicians, and great installation.  My only problem with them is their appointment system.   I have made 3 appointments in 2 years for solar service and in each case,  the appointments were lost.  When I called to confirm, they had no record of the appointments, even though they were made by their own technicians.    Their in-house customer service needs  some correction and improvement.<//Text><user>103927644102700967385<//user>< rate>

The service technician was knowledgeable, kind, and efficient. He cleaned our unit out in the 103 weather with a smile. He referred me back to the office/original salesman for the issues I am still having since getting the new unit. Just have one room still not cooling down.

Every 1 star rated review is typical and ongoing as evidenced, this company sold their own salesman a new furnace at his Lake if the Pines home which used propane, it was not a propane furnace nor retrofitted for propane and it was left to run this way, the furnace was impacted with soot and numerous technicians were sent out attempting to fix the problem by replacing everything on the unit when it needed to be removed, the customer, a Sierra Pacific employee was kept unaware of why his new furnace seemingly was  not repairable , when a company treats its own employees this way you know it is no better for anyone else. Another new install on a heat pump  used the existing line set  from an old GE AC system which was not compatible for heat pump use, the flexible line set  had plastic lining that melted and was sucked into the new condensing unit that was destroyed, Sierra Pacific said it was defective, not admitting their installation error  to their own distributor, that is fraud. There have been "tune ups"   performed on working units that became non working units  and one was so full of propane there was not enough oxygen in the place to explode easily, 10% gas  and 90% air is optimal, they  routinely  have solar  technicians  perform HVAC calls after having a HVAC man who is competent take them on calls for awhile and cut them lose on customers homes. The roof issues were ongoing as now too,  if a roof is not near new  there should probably not be a solar system installed on top of it  which requires making holes in the roof, lots of them!  Installations that were weeks before they learned the equipment was not compatible  nor was the zoning setup  they  sold,  none of it would work together, they even  had "CHARLIE BROWN" look at it and he could not fix it!  No that is not a joke, Lennox had a troubleshooter  with that name,they  then compensated the customer by  upgrading their equipment which  was making it dicey  since the initial install s so incompetent. New installs that were not working for weeks  that had the panel fall off in the attic sucking in 150 F air  and fiberglass dust into the unit and home.
By now you might have surmised I was employed by Sierra Pacific  and yes I was, this is how I know the things I assert here, I did not work  there very long either. Their dispatcher rode with me on a call to Shingle springs  he day  to see a collection of cars he had been told of, I fixed the hydronic system that numerous techs failed  and we went back  to  the shop, weeks later I get called in by the manager Mike  alleging a report was made alleging a Sierra Pacific van was on the freeway involved in a road rage incident where the Sierra Pacific van driver threw a bottle  out his drivers window at a car  to his right getting off the freeway  and in the exit lanes  about 40 feet away and allegedly  bashe the windshield  and gave  an elderly  woman  sitting in the back of the car an angina episode.
The manager  and the dispatcher  both had me in Mike's office  and they  said they had both reviewed the time sheets  and I was the only  technician working that day  at that time in that area  and the Highway Patrol was asking them about it, I was surprised they  said it had to be me  cause  this never happened  and did not  really sound plausible  , but the Highway patrol  was involved  so that worried me, I racked my brain  trying to figure out what day it was that I was in the area and when they  showed me  I realized it was the day  the dispatcher rode with me to  Shingle springs!!!!  I pointed this out  and Mike was saying what time was the dispatcher clocked out , it was after the alleged incident!  meaning he was with me! I had it there but was more I can't fit, they fired me for staying at a motel and cheated me out of EDD by lying ,saying I lived in the van!!
This rating is not fake,  Employees past  & inexperienced are associated with their C20 license. They defrauded Lennox, cheated me and sales man Ken Baxter who bought a new furnace, they won't ever admit to it, ask Ken!</text>

Absolutely the best and most comprehensive service we have ever received since singing on board with Sierra. I  feel as if he truly wanted to assist us and fix the problem. He went out of his way to test the pump, the water flow, heat transfer, etc. All of which no one else has done previously. Upon completion we had a discussion concerning his findings and he asked that I clean the filter system again and then call to see if the solar is heating the water more efficiently. Very positive experience. Will definitely recommend Sierra for this service.<//Text>

<Review>Wow!  I want to thank Jason Hansen (the owner of Sierra Pacific Home and Comfort) and his team!  I just got off the phone with him regarding a concern I had (he spent 30 min with me on the phone I never felt like I was being rushed to end the call or that he had other matters to attend to.  He made me feel that my Family and I were the most important concern and that he needed to address our concerns!) Unfortunately there was a miscommunication but Jason went above and beyond my expectations.  He personally reached out to me.  I have never had the owner of a company be so easily available to its customers.  This re-assured me of the original decision and reason why I selected to go with Sierra Pacific!  Their reputation and believe in customer satisfaction is unmatched!  I am a Life Long customer because of this and will continue to do business with them on future projects and refer them to Friends and Family.  Any company can say they believe in their products and services but Sierra Pacific lives it, stands by it and makes it a reality! The company is extremely experienced and Jason truly believes in his company and his employees!  Make the right choice!  Sierra Pacific Home and Comfort.< /Review>< Date>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>The customer service has deteriorated over the years. Have bought 2 solar systems for my pool from them over the years. The second one never worked right and developed constant leaks. They changed every panel at least once. Didn't tell me that there was a recall and they should have replaced them all at once instead of one at a time as they failed. Now the warranty is up and they charge me $150 a trip to fix the constant leaks. Plus they make me wait at least a month for service even though I had a "preferred" customer contract. Just cancelled the contract and will just do without solar on the pool for awhile. Not worth having when it is inoperable most of the time.</Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1573589290606, 'text': 'John, I can appreciate your concern, I hope we can earn your confidence back. Let me assure you that Sierra Pacific works diligently to serve our clients with technicians that are well trained, honest, and ones that you will like to have at your home. While we do not have control over the manufacturing process, we are excellent at our installation and service. We are constantly recruiting for new staff that we trust to have the good character and customer service skills to serve our clients. There is not a trade school that teaches Solar Pool Heating Panel service - Sierra Pacific must train each Service Professional individually to be qualified to perform safe roof top solar pool panel service. As a result, there is a limited supply of Solar Pool Service staff to perform Start-ups, Winterization shut-downs, and respond to service repairs â but the ones you get from Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort are second to none. Our service fees are based on the necessary practices for our team to train, work, and operate safely in the State of California. To provide a custom trained service technician in a fully stocked truck to get to your home to perform a safe roof top repair is a specialized service that costs a lot to accomplish. My goal is to help keep your solar pool system operating at peak condition without troubles. I think we can help you here. Please expect a call so we can make sure you are taken care of.\nKind Regards\nJason Hanson\nPresident'}< /Resp>

David was our service technician. Upon arrival he immediately identified the source of the leak in our passive solar system, made the necessary repairs and turned the system on. Immediately our pool began heating.  He was professional and efficient. Sierra Pacific came recommended by our pool cleaning service.< /Text>

Well here we go again.......YOU have had another chance again after your response to my review to make it right!
Unfortunately,  Again We DON'T HEAR  a peep from you even though in your response to my review, You try to make it look to your customers that you are more than willing to take care of them.

Anyone reading this must wonder why in the world would you not take care of a customer where YOU HAVE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU PUT HOLES IN THEIR ROOF and you talked them into an upgraded system in where it's costing them more money and you continue to put them off and not install what you were supposed to have done weeks ago.  I'm sure you're aware that we've had many people tell us that legally we should be going after you.
We would never recommend Sierra Pacific!

Below orginal review.

Unfortunately, we could never recommend them!  About 10 plus years ago when we hired them to put our pool solar in they did what we thought at the time a great job. However, after a few years we became aware that some panels were defective and under warranty, they were leaking. We waited for Sierra Pacific to come out and replace those panels which eventually they did,  but unfortunately put holes in our roof during the process.  Sierra Pacific response was our roof was old and needed to be replaced.  Our roof was old but had no issues until they came out and created holes when they were remounting the panels which caused leaks in our roof.  Our roof definitely had a few more years and we were planning on replacing it, but again there were NO LEAKS IN THE ROOF UNTIL THEY CAME OUT TO DO THEIR WORK.   Sierra Pacific acknowledged the holes and said they would give us a discount in remounting these panels after we put on our new roof. Well that obviously didn't cover the damage inside our house and nor did it take care of the problem that this could happen again when they're mounting the panels.  Sierra Pacific talked my husband into upgrading the panels, which obviously they're making more money, and saying that way they can use a different system when installing the new panels.  We had a new roof installed and ordered the upgraded panels that they suggested.  They continue to put us on the back burner when it came to removing the panels and setting up a date to install the new ones.  We have been so gracious by continuing to work with them and upgrading the panels. However, they are the ones that put the holes in the roof, so one would think we would be one of their first priorities, however, they continue to make us wait by scheduling us far out and then a day before the installation they call to reschedule it three more weeks out.
So as you can see this company lacks integrity and putting their customer first.  So obviously we could never recommend them!< /text>< Pics>

{'time': 1556745248915, 'text': "Crystal, I'm sorry your roof was in such a condition. Our methods don't create problems on a roof. Sierra Pacific did not create your problem, the roof was in poor shape from factors not related to any work done by Sierra Pacific, age being a primary factor. It is the reason we recommended for your husband to repair the roof. He was able to see the reason for our recommendations and took action on his own to remedy the roof. We are doing our best to provide you a solar pool heating solution per your request and could not do it on the old roof. By the time we were notified that you were ready for the new solar pool heating collectors, our schedule was already booked out so we are doing our best to serve everyone with new installations in an orderly fashion.\n\nKind Regards,\nJason Hanson\nPresident"}</response>

I'd like to recommend Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort to my friend because the service is perfect (5 stars). When I called to request the service, the secretary was very nice and the technician who came to my house to check the system was very hard-working. He looked careful and examined to make sure the system that runs fine or if anything goes wrong. He would tell us. Thank you very much for the service. We're glad to have this company that installed the new heating system for our house. Thank you again.</Text>

Our service technician was Chris and he has a great attitude and was very polite.  He was very friendly with our pups who shake down anyone that comes in the house.

We had just purchased this home and Sierra Pacific agreed to inspect the heater, even though it is summer, as well as the A/C, when every other company I called refused.

Chris performed a very thorough inspection of the heating and air conditioning systems.

The cost was very reasonable and the phone service is timely, competent, and polite.< /Text>

The staff was friendly and kind. Kevin was a really cool guy. He explained what happened and I felt he was very  thorough and fixed the issue in a timely manner.  The system works great and I am satisfied.

Ok so I did not use the system for a couple of weeks and when I went to turn it back on it would not blow cool air. Sierra Pacific sent out another guy named Cary Sommers. This guy identified the second issue not found the first time and fixed the issue. My house is nice a cool and I am once again happy. Carey was polite kind and definitely knew his stuff. He explained what was wrong and fixed the system. Carey thanks dude. You did a good job</text>

Wouldn't you know it--the heater picks the coldest weather to stop working--and it's on a weekend. Sierra Pacific not only answered my call but set up a repair appointment that afternoon. Kevin spend all the time he needed to diagnose and fix the problem to out satisfaction. Highly recommended!</Text>

My technician that came out to service my AC unit today was Corey. Not only was he incredibly thorough, but was very informative, and helped me better understand my system, the maintenance it would require, and the service he was performing.

I had service on the LG mini-Split Unit heating/AC in my shop. The service was excellent: On time, efficient, and effective. Andy and Kevin worked steadily and happily. My mini-split is more-or-less like new, after serving me for 8 years already.

Since the mini-split service, I have had a high end Lennox HVAC system in stalled by Sierra Pacific, using their program with Costco. The system is good, although after two years, it was necessary to replace first the AC condenser coil and then the compressor. This was unfortunate, since the system was out of warranty for labor. But Sierra Pacific made the repairs promptly, and the service reps were excellent. Joel just finished doing annual maintenance on the AC. All the technicians have been excellent.</Text>

< Review>
We highly recommend Sierra Pacific of Rancho Cordova.  First, our design experience was great.   Our consultant, Bryan, was great.  He was prompt, knowledgeable, and thorough.  We had no questions unanswered when he left.  We completely understood the terms and time frame, and everything we discussed and agreed upon is what we received.  Peter, who measured the windows was also prompt and efficient.  Every window and door installed fit perfectly.  The installation technician completed the work in one day, as promised .  He was careful and precise.  Everything looks perfect. We have had our new windows for a little over 3 months and we are very happy with the windows.  Not only do they look great, they really do make a difference in our home comfort.  We had doubts that we would really notice a difference.  Until one of the hottest weeks in Tracy - our AC unit failed!  The AC technicians had to order a part and we we without an AC for 2 days with100% temperatues.  Our house stayed15 or more degrees cooler than outside.  It doesn't sound like a lot, but trust me, it makes a difference.  We have recommended Sierra Pacific to our coworkwrs and friends.  We will definitely contact them first for any future needs.<//Review>

<Text>I wish I had read the reviews before hiring Sierra Pacific to install my pool solar.  They were very proficient at saying the right words regarding customer service with their phone messages, websites, and even commercials, but it all fell apart when it came to action. I tried very hard to get someone to resolve my problems before writing this review but there is absolutely nobody to voice concerns in hopes of a remedy.

Our relationship started off good.  The salesman was knowledgeable and made my wife and I feel good about the purchasing decision.  We even opted in for the monthly service so our system stays in top shape.   I did my part and paid the money but writing the checks was only the easy part.

After the check cashed we had problem after problem.  Our Spa has not worked right after the install.  They sent out a technician and then a "Senior" technician came but the problem they created was beyond each of their skill sets.  As the homeowner, this was not reassuring when you are hiring professionals to do the work.  We had a leak last year and when I called, Sierra Pacific tried every with excuse instead of actually finding and addressing the leak.  They eventually found the leak but it was a painful process.   Painful call after painful call is the pattern in dealing with the company and not to mention another leak at the end of last season.  I left it for the following year as I did not have the strength for another battle since at the end of swim season.  Maybe this is a tactic on their end?

Fast forward to this year.  Being a priority customer it still takes MONTHS to get my solar turned on but this time I also wanted the leak fixed.  Water spraying from my rooftop is not ideal.  The technician ended up coming out a second time after the "turn on" to address this leak and he informs me that the problems I am having is due to a poor install.  I let him know that SIERRA PACIFIC did the install and he says..."Welp, what do I know anyway?"  He says that he saved me $600 by cutting the panel and tying off the leak.  My system is under warranty so why would you cut into my panel and band-aid it if they are defective? Seems like they are not addressing the original issue instead waiting for it to fall out of warranty then hit me with the big bill.

I spoke to Sierra Pacific about the comment from the technician.  I also refused to pay for the $50 service fee until this is resolved so of course they sent a technician right away.  SP does something 'right away'?  Oh that's right, because I owed them money.

The "Senior" technician comes out to the house and finds more possible leaks and shuts off my solar heating to my pool.  WHAT?!?  Why does it get shut off in August without my consent?  I called Sierra Pacific to complain and there is nobody to talk to with authority and no manager will ever call back.  I was then told they will come back and turn my pool on in October.  They turned it off in the summer and will come back out to fix what they reversed two months later?  This entire company is a joke.  How do they stay in business?<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1567206236746, 'text': 'Brian, I met with Service Manager who you have since spoke with and she resolved your concerns to my knowledge.

Very good experience from initial consultation to final installation. Each aspect was professional and caring.

About 2 weeks ago, I finally succumbed and turned on the AC when the temps went above 100F. Unfortunately, the vents didnât seem to be blowing out cool air.
I called on a Tuesday evening, but they werenât able to be me scheduled till the following Tuesday. So, I deducted 1/2 star for that. Thankfully, it wasnât too crazy hot the next 3 days, but the weekend was in the mid-upper 90s. Thank goodness for table fans.
Then they finally came in to fix, Phillip, the technician, discovered exactly what was wrong right away. Unfortunately, what was wrong was a mistake he believes was made during the original install 3 years ago. He appologized and got to work as soon as he let the office know the situation and ended up working for a good 4 hours.
You might ask why such a high rating considering the original botched job. It was because Phillip was very thorough, very diligent and very professional. I could tell he took his job very seriously. There was another issue he discovered as well, but because it wasnât one of the things they replaced in 2015, it was not part of the warranty and I had to pay for it. I was fine with that. All things considered, the damage could have been a lot worse.
Today, temps got above 100F again, but I can feel nice cold air blowing.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I was skeptical that a solar heating system would be worth the money....and I was wrong.  Within a week my normally useless pool was 80 degrees and we've been in it a lot.  Happy family!  Highly recommend Sierra Pacific for anyone shopping to heat their pool without raising their utility bill through the roof.  Great customer service, one day installation, and  minimal consumer involvement in system operation.  Best money spent in years.</Text>

I moved into my home almost three years ago and have never had my solar pool panels checked out. After meeting with Sierra Pacific about my HVAC system, the representative recommended that I have these panels inspected before the swimming season kicks in.

Chris, from Sierra Pacific showed up today and performed a thorough inspection of my system. Fortunately, my 15 year old panels still work and do not leak. However, he DID discover a significant leak in a pvc pipe joint which he repaired while here. The work was thorough and Chris could not possibly been more polite or professional in all aspects. It was a pleasure having him at my home.< /Review>

<Review>We have had three of our heater/air conditioner units installed by Sierra Pacific.  Now they service them on a regular basis.  There work is always first rate.  They come on time, work diligently, have the highest professional standards, and are courteous.  I would not look elsewhere and would encourage all to use them for their heating and air conditioning problems.</Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I was referred to Sierra Pacific from a family member. They have had solar pool heating through Sierra Pacific for ten years with no issues and there pool can get heated to over 90+ degrees. When Gene came out on the initial visit his demonstration showed me right away that the product was made of very good materials and would work efficiently.  The installation teams were very friendly and cleaned up well after. Throughout the entire process the teams were on time, respectful, and willing to answer any questions I have. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Carey arrived as scheduled, explained what he was going to do and proceeded to diagnose my A/C problem. He is very knowledgeable about the system and explained each step in his investigation. He found the problem in a very hot attic. I am very happy with his professionalism. He should be the example for all your employees.</Review>

< Review>
We just had Sierra Pacific install a solar heater for the pool.  It was a great experience all around.  I got a ballpark estimate from the salesman about 9 months ago and told him I didn't want to be bugged with phone calls because I needed the time to save the money.  He kept his word and I didn't hear from him again until I initiated contact.  He was timely for our appointment, thorough in his explanation yet to the point so the appointment didn't take up my whole morning.  The day of installation, the crew was here when they said they would be and they finished within the time frame they said.  When they left, everything was as clean as it was before the install.  The gentleman who showed us the operations of the system was hugely patient as I walked in right at the end of his "lesson" and he repeated the whole thing to me!  All and all, an excellent experience and now I have a nice warm pool.  Doesn't get any better than that!!<//Review>

<text>I had Sierra Pacific home and Comfort in Rancho Cordova service an air conditioning unit which worked fine at the time. The servicing of this second unit was part of the contract when I had them replace a main unit. They forgot to service this second unit at the time  and came out in November,  11 months later, to service this second unit . They found a capacitor that was slightly weak, charged $200 to replace the capacitor. After their sevicing, the first time the heater attempted to turn on it would not come on. I called Sierra Pacific to come back out, they want another $700 plus dollars to do a repair.
Their service man was very polite, but as a consumer when these things happen we sometimes scratch our head and ask why did it work fine before the service and not after.<//text><UserId.>113677517244494269214<//UserId.>< name>

From start to finish, these folks are very professional. The initial '
sales call' was at our request, and was informational enough so that we chose Sierra Pacific over 2 other companies. There was a long delay over the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years holidays, but they started on the contract date promptly, with a full and professional crew. Three days later we were in the Solar Panel business! The city building inspector was impressed with the electrical connections, which of course pleases us. Now we wait for sunshine and success! Thanks - good job all around!< /Text>

Responding to the string below started by Crystal and Jason (partial is below)

Jason, let's be sure we get the fact straight on this...

1.  After the initial installation years ago, we had no issues with any roof leaks and the roof still had at least 20 years left on it.
2.  Our roof developed leaks ONLY AFTER after your team came back on a warranty call to replace some leaking panels.
3.  When your Tech and I viewed the damage from within the attic space, we were both shocked to see the gaping hole at one of the strap attachment points - he took pictures.  From the top, the opening in the shingles was so large I could have put my fist through it.  Worse, the damage was done near the top of the panels at the header, literally stopping the flow of rain water from higher up on the roof at the header, only to allow a free flow of water into my attic space in large quantities.  The LEAST that could have been done at that time is that the warranty techs could have alerted me to the damage they created so I could have repaired it before it rained - yet for some reason they chose to stay silent.. resulting in water damage to the inside of our home.  THIS IS A SERIOUS INTEGRITY ISSUE!
4.  Thereafter, I sent a video to your Service Manager showing the literal water fall that was occurring over a window on the inside of my bedroom, directly beneath the area described above.
5.  We have been very gracious and patient with your company and have not escalated the matter (a path that could have easily been taken given all the facts and physical evidence).  We have never asked for compensation for the internal damages caused by your work.  We have only asked for you to be fair and reasonable with the charges for removal of the old panels and installation of the new panels.
6.  As a result of the damages caused by your company we opted to replace the roof (doing only this section would have looked stupid).
7.  As far as scheduling... in Feb/March we scheduled the panel removal, which occurred on 4/10/19.  In March we scheduled reinstall of new panels for May 2 (some 6+ weeks after it was scheduled).  We are still not sure how or why the new panels were not in your shop ready for the May 2 schedule date.... again we have been very gracious and patient under the circumstances and have not received like treatment from your company... very disappointing and concerning as Crystal indicated in her review.

Maybe its time you called me to work this out before this mole hill becomes a mountain.

Mark

Jason,

Well here we go again.......YOU have had another chance again after your response to my review to make it right!
Unfortunately,  Again We DON'T HEAR  a peep from you even though in your response to my review, You try to make it look to your customers that you are more than willing to take care of them.

Anyone reading this must wonder why in the world would you not take care of a customer where YOU HAVE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU PUT HOLES IN THEIR ROOF and you talked them into an upgraded system in where it's costing them more money and you continue to put them off and not install what you were supposed to have done weeks ago.  I'm sure you're aware that we've had many people tell us that legally we should be going after you.
We would never recommend Sierra Pacific!

Below original review.

Unfortunately, we could never recommend them!  About 10 plus years ago when we hired them to put our pool solar in they did what we thought at the time a great job. However, after a few years we became aware that some panels were defective and under warranty, they were leaking. We waited for Sierra Pacific to come out and replace those panels which eventually they did,  but unfortunately put holes in our roof during the process.  Sierra Pacific response was our roof was old and needed to be replaced.  Our roof was old but had no issues until they came out and created holes when they were remounting the panels which caused leaks in our roof.<//text>

I had to put my tenants in my own house !   I contacted them back and complained and said one of their managers would call me back which they never did again no trust issue with this company !  I contacted  itâs major competitors and they all said their company would never do that  and would give me 1 to 2 day service  so go to another company if you want good service  if you plan on purchasing units like I did .

We used the Costco program to purchase a new HVAC unit.  Sales rep offered several options while allowing us to customize our request.  We mentioned that one room was significantly cooler or warmer (depending on the season) than the rest of the house.  He said they might need to change the size of the duct work or add a second air feed to the room.

Today (2/3/16), I made my seventh service call since the installation date of early November 2015.  Problems began when the original crew was pulled from job before it was finished.  Second crew knew nothing of the special needs of the one room.  Third, fourth and fifth crews have diagnosed different problems while adding larger ducts, a second duct, a return air vent, and relocation of the thermostat.  After conversations with these crew leaders, installation and service managers, and finally a VP, we have a room that is a wonderful 55 degrees on this chilly morning.  It is only 15 degrees cooler than the rest of the house.  There is more HOT air in the word of management than is in the room.  Run away from this provider unless you want to wait around for service calls for months at a time.<//Review>

< Review>
Sierra Pacific completed a fairly technical energy upgrade on my 24 year old house.  The design was challenging, but the salesman and installation crew were technical and very professional.  They focused on a clean install and I was impressed all the way around - an outstanding and quality job was performed at each step: design, rough-in, install, and startup.

The job included replacing two large older tank water heaters with tankless models, installing three new systems in bedrooms, replacing the furnace and relocating the AC compressor to the far side of the house.  To make the project more interesting, the house is built into a hill and the bedrooms downstairs had no heat nor ducting;  Sierra Pacific installed very efficient wall units in two rooms and a small mini split to serve two rooms.  We were able to move in and with heat in the bedrooms!

The final phase was the energy testing for possible PGE rebates.  The testing company was very impressed with the leak reduction of 20%. Approximately 10% of the leak reduction was attributed to the HVAC work and 10% to the new French doors (not installed by Sierra Pacific).  The energy testing team demonstrated the same level of professionalism as Sierra Pacific.

I wish all of the workers who contributed to the house redo were of the same caliber as the SP guys in the shiny red trucks.  I chose them for the quality of the service department and I wanted to know the install company would stand by their work for years.  I have no regrets with using Sierra Pacific.  Again the install team was amazing (Nick, Kevin, and Alejandro I think).< /Review>

Great company.  We had our Heating and Air installed by them.  They did a great job.  A few years later we had our Solar system installed by them.  They are an awesome company.  Very professional with a strong focus on customer service.  Their prices are very competitive.  Their workers are extremely professional and perform hight quality work.  I will use them for everything possible.< /text>

<Text>My wife and I had the very best experience from first contact through installation of the top of the line matched equipment. Everybody has been respectful and forthcoming. Every question I could think of was answered. Answers to questions I hadn't thought of were also presented. I had five different companies in my home providing quotes for multiple line of products. I chose Sierra Pacific to provide me with a complete system and reduct. The installation exceeded Title 24 requirements and the most recent building code regulations. The system is new and we have been pleased thus far. The new system is extremely quiet as well as efficient and will save me money compared to the system that was installed when the house was built in 2002. I can't make a stronger recommendation than Sierra Pacific.

<text>We purchased a brand new HVAC unit and duct work through Sierra Pacific.  Installed 7/2015.  Service and work was fair, despite a worker falling through my hallway ceiling and then needing that to be repaired.  But Sierra Pacific handled everything and did a good job.  Fast forward 3 yrs later everything was working great, until one day among our 100 degree days in Sacramento our A/C stopped working.  We called Sierra Pacific to come check it out because we are still under warranty for our new unit.  Technician Carey came out, he was very nice, but had to take our whole unit apart to find out 2 copper wires internally were sitting on each other, which eroded a hole in one of the lines.  This hole resulted in a loss of Freon and our unit to not work.  Carey was very nice and showed us the issue.  He stated he had never seen anything like this before.  I asked if there was anything that could have been done to prevent this, his response - "no".  I requested to have a supervisor to call me, which I expected the next day.  I reached out the following day and left a message fro the Service Manager, Tricia.....NO call back.  So the next day, Thursday I called again and spoke with Desiree this time.  I asked if there was an update for my repairs, she responded no.  I let her know the situation and that i had already left a message for Tricia, but have not received a call back.  It is now Friday morning, 3 days since a service technician came out and found the problem.  BUT no movement on my repairs, no update from a supervisor OR anyone in the company for that matter. I have filed a complaint with Lennox.  The temps have been n the 80's the last few days, but going back up to 100 this weekend.  My family with 2 young children and an elderly dog have NO A/C despite still paying a $13,000 bill for brand new unit 3 yrs that Sierra Pacific would like me to pay another $921 for the labor on a faulty unit.  Does this sound like a company.  I am not seeing or feeling any of their guarantees of great service and products currently!!  - Very unhappy customers</text><rate>1</rate>< username>

So the technician was held up on his call just prior to mine.  These things do happen and it caused quite the delay in his expected arrival time. However, the office team was keeping me informed the whole time so I could adjust my schedule accordingly. So no problem there. Andy, the tech was extremely knowledgeable, professional and courteous. Most importantly he had a great attitude. Oh and he fixed the problem!  I highly recommend Sierra Pacific for any HVAC needs.  Oh, and one thing more, I have just retired from 50 years in the construction industry. So I've seen a thing or two regarding HVAC Contractors.<//Review>

Just finished week six post install.  My meter has gone from 04116 to 03943.  Thatâs a run back of 173 kWh. PGE bill was $8.10.  Did all of this with just 15 Panasonic panels installed for a 2,700 sq ft house.  And, that was with cabinet guys, landscape guys, and painters running thru my my house/yard the entire time running their jack hammers, air compressors, and power tools.  Am I happy with Sierra Pacific?  You bet.</text>

My annual service was delayed two months.  Then the technitian came out for 15 minutes, said looks great might need a part next year and left.  I left my house as well.  Came home later that day to a 90 degree house with no A/C working.  Went out to the compressor and the coils were still dirty and the leaves were still in the bottom of the unit.  I called service and they did send another Tech out at 7pm.  He was great and fixed everything, and cleaned the unit.<//Review>

We had Sierra Pacific install a completely new heating and cooling system in our home, adding more returns and zoning the living spaces.  We talked with 4 other HVAC contractors, and were impressed with the professional approach of Sierra Pacific, even though they were not the cheapest bid.  Their installation crew was very knowledgeable, tidy, and courteous.  The new system works so much better than the old, and we expect the efficiency improvements to return the cost in a little over 5 years.  If you're looking for a new HVAC system, you need to talk with Sierra Pacific.< /text>

There was a problem with the installation but Sierra took care of it in a professional manner.   Problems happen and the quality of the installer is proven by the way they respond.  The only area where they fell a little short, was that I expected to be able to monitor the performance (salesman said so) of each panel on their web application but they only allow access to summary performance data.  Seems to be a change in policy as my neighbor who bought from them a few months earlier, got full access.  They really should allow customers full access to the solaredge app.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1526942096723, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing Sierra Pacific!\nJason Hanson\nPresident'}< /response><gmapID>0x809ae78653e1ae55:0xc1af10384c3548b9< /gmapID></record>

<review>I had Kris Dysthe in my home to provide a quote for replacing my HVAC system. Kris crawled in my attic to check out the equipment I have currently, and provided me a written estimate.

Fast forward a week, and my bathroom ceiling has caved in. I went up in the attic and found 2 broken condensation lines pouring water into my ceiling! The lines were directly in the path that Kris took to the equipment, and noone has been in my attic before or since (I've owned this house for 4 months, and nobody has been up there since I bought it).

I called Kris, and he denied that he did anything, but offered to have someone come out the next day to repair the broken lines. I got a call from Jason Hansen (the owner) and he (in a very unprofessional tone) told me that they are not responsible, and quickly ended the phone call.

At no point did Kris or Jason even offer to come inspect the damage before they blanketly denied any responsibility.  Do not do business with these people, not even for a competing bid. They do not take responsibility for their actions. They don't even make an effort to do so.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3bPPngX1avbEC4cZ9_KPYW6eftJ5Lc55DyDe1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

The 2 previous technicians had a switch in the wrong setting. Now its July, and after 3 appointments finally my very expensive solar system is actually working. Thanks to Dave! A suggestion, either have Dave train your other techs on the timer panel and system components, or have a sync between what your installers are installing and what your technicians are trained in servicing.</review>

<rating>4<//rating><text>I am a long time customer of Sierra Pacific and late last year I had a full replacement completed on AC and heating unit for my home. I am writing this letter to state how well your staff installed and instructed me on the use of my new system.  I am very satisfied with my system and I can see my energy bill has decreased dramatically especially for AC.  You have installed both my pool solar and now my HVAC and I am impressed your company and staff.  The only thing they missed was the fact that they had to pour a slab for the unit which they did after I mentioned that was part of the quote.  Also, the unit completely broke down once but was quickly fixed under warranty.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1526942637349, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing Sierra Pacific!\nJason Hanson\nPresident'}</response><GmapID>0x809ae78653e1ae55:0xc1af10384c3548b9< /GmapID></record>

We have solar system for the pool and this year has been a headache with there office try to get them out here to fix leaks all they tell u is it will be 3 weeks for some one to be out there 1 month later another leak they tell me it will be 4 weeks befor they can fix it and it's under warranty come on. We are on our third leak now. All I care about is my 2 kids with disabilities that would like to use the pool and not have it cold. U guys were out today and told me my system can't get fixed to Aug 30 really that's the best u can do.< /Review>

The work was done in a very professional manner. After the work was done an appointment  was made for the inspector to check the installation. After waiting most of the day the inspection was to be done I called and found that the appointment had never been scheduled. Hopefully this has been corrected.< /Review>

I normally don't write reviews but took the time to enthusiastically recommend Sierra Pacific (SP).  I had a problem with my solar pool panels installed by SP and manufactured by Fafco as they frequently sprang leaks.  The panels have a 12 year warranty  and are expensive.  The panels occasionally do spring a leak but only a few times a year.  Mine were springing leaks every month.  When I last checked with SP, Fafco had not authorized the warranty repair but because it had been months I had been complaining about the situation, SP took care of their customer and installed all new panels at their own expense.  This is what I call outstanding customer service which happens rarely in today's world.<//text>

Amazing! That is the best word to describe my experience with your company.

My home had a non-functioning heating and AC unit and there was no way we could endure another hot summer.  Although I knew it would be a huge expense I knew I had to start getting quotes.  I began with scheduling two other companies before I scheduled my appointment with Sierra Pacific.  After the first appointment was over my head was already spinning and I was feeling pressure from their rep to âjust sign nowâ I hated the pressure.  When your design specialist Gary came to my home for our appointment he was courteous and knowledgeable.  He didnât rush or pressure me in any way and even told me about financing options which I was not aware of.  After meeting with Gary I was sold on Sierra Pacific.

When the date for installation came Brian called me, introduced himself and let me know when they would be arriving at my home.  As soon as they arrived Brian re-introduced himself along with Ray and Jake and walked me through what would be done on that day.  Brian, Ray and Jake were friendly and polite.  They quickly began doing all the preparations and got to work.  They did an amazing job, stopping to answer any question I had or explain anything I didnât understand.  The level of customer service Brian, Ray and Jake provided me was refreshing.  Both days when they were finished they would make sure I didnât have any further questions and walk me though what was done and if anything further still had to be done.  When the installation was complete everything looked superb, clean, and professional and most of all everything was functioning like it was supposed to be.

I have already started telling my family and friends about what a great job Brian, Ray and Jake did and have been recommending Sierra Pacific to them.  I hope you know what amazing staff you have and appreciate them as much as I did. Kudos to Brian, Ray, Jake and Gary!

Thank you for maintaining the highest level of customer service, I will be going to you first for my further home needs!< /Review>

< review>
We had a Lennox Heating and AC system installed January 2015 and a few months later, our system broke and major system components including the compressor had to be replaced.  The system had the same problem again and needs the same parts replaced. We left several messages and the manager never called us back. We would not recommend Sierra Heating and Air to anyone.<//review>

I also offer to personally follow through on this situation.

We would like to express our satisfaction regarding our recent purchase of a new HVAC system for our home.  From the moment we met Tom Chiriaco, your sales representative, we were impressed with his knowledge and professional courtesy.  He answered all of our questions, which helped us make a decision on the unit we ultimately purchased.

The new system was installed on June 19th by Brian, Chris and Seth.  These young men were hard-working and very considerate of us and our home and made the whole experience a pleasant one.  They did a fantastic job!

Before making our decision, we received two other bids, but by selecting your company and doing business with your sales representative and installers, we are confident that we chose the right firm.  Thank you and please express our gratitude to Tom, Brian, Chris and Seth.</review>

Sierra Pacific and specifically John Abella with the Installation Crew did an excellent job with the installation of our Lennox HVAC system.  Our experience was excellent from the Installation Design Expert Dominic and the office staff.  We are very happy with the system since once again the temperature has gone up again in October.  When the Sac County inspector came to approve the completion of the building permit, he also complimented the fine work done by the installation crew.  When a expert on HVAC compliments the job you know you have a good product.  Thank you Sierra Pacific for a great job.</review>

<review>My fan motor went bad, they carry no universal replacement motors like other companies as truck stock, they must install the exact motor they remove or are unable to wire the motor! Unless the colors matched on the exact motor! There are only 2 sides of power coming off the power pole to a house lol!
Service technician was an ex pool technician, could only install anything but exact motor.
This requires at least 2 trips and that is best case scenario!
parts acquisition and then a time to install it, could be days before that all happens! This makes the labor like doing 2 service calls instead of 1 call and gone! cheaper to hire pool techs and bill customer for getting the motor then coming out a 2nd time.
Management nor ownership has any hands on HVAC experience, magazine mechanic fudges as qualified individual for the C20 lic.</review><Time>1469820224660< /Time><Resp>{'time': 1526944882849, 'text': 'Dear Mr. King Kong, we do not show a "King Kong" in our system as a client.

I was referred to Sierra Pacific Home and Comfort by Costco.  I asked for a second opinion when I was told by my current service provider that my air conditioning system was failing.  Sierra Pacific technician came and read several reports from my service provider and then inspected the air conditioning and heating system.  He, then, sat down and explain the reports written and told me my sistem was getting old but not failing.  I was shocked.  He could have concurred with my service provider and I would not have known any difference.  The company employs honest technicians and has moral vailues by telling the truth to homeowners.  As a result, I will get my upgraded system and maintainance from this company when the time comes.  The technician was very knowledgable and explained the air conditioning system in words I understood.  This company now has my loyalty and respect.< /Text>

For safety concerns, we have had to reschedule a tremendous amount of work that would normally have been done earlier in the season. The whole construction industry has faced the rain delays and once again this week late in May we are getting more delays from rain. We are working furiously to catch up with our work. We hope to get a chance to redeem ourselves for you in the quality of our work and excellent service professionals at your home.\nRespectfully,\nJason Hanson\nPresident'}<//response><rate>1<//rate>< date>
