< review>
About 8 months ago I arrived to Los Angeles as a travel RN. I was fortunate to find Jackie at Masters Barbers. Jackie is amazing! She listened to what I wanted and made it happen. She is great at conversing, and an amazing barber. I often feel stress trying to find the right barber, and it is often a process whenever I jump around from city to city. With Jackie, it was immediately on point. I'm now heading back home for a bit, and I'm going to miss the city, but am also going to miss my barber Jackie. Hit her up, she will definitely clean you up nice!<//review>

The barber pays a lot of attention to detail of how you want the cut done and the charges were extremely affordable. Also, the barber was very friendly and kind. This the only barber I trust from now on. Again, Thank you so much! Highly recommended to all!<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2b724fec5e459:0xbcdd7b0cdeb57669<//gmap_id><user>109916312278234726164< /user>< Pictures>

Yesterday, I left this shop with a smile because of the very good service that I received. Honestly, the barber did a great job of my haircut, and it was highly impressive and astonishing. Their shop was a very good place to visit to ask for service because it was clean, nice, and stylish. As a satisfied customer,  I will continue to ask service. Thanks!<//review>

Gentleman, this is a hidden gem that you will want to keep secret. Inviting, laid back but with a high level of professionalism. Israel and his team run a smooth operation -  I bring my son here too who is only 1.5 and when he sees Israel, he knows the drill, sits up on the chair and lets him do his magic. A lifelong customer, cheers guys<//Text>

I have been going to Master Barbers for over a year now.  Israel and his team are true artisans.  Tell them what you want and they'll do it, or let them go to work and you'll look great every time.  Their online appointment booking and payment also makes it really easy to schedule and pay.</text>

I've been going to Israel(the owner) since he was a barber at another location and he is stellar! As long as I live in LA this will be the only barber shop I go to.

I had tried other barbers and salons before and everyone always just did a mediocre job. Master Barbers does a great job, does a straight razor finish, and completes the service with a quick massage! Not to mention the place and aesthetic are pretty rad.

Totally recommend. (But make sure to book in advance!)<//text>

This place is now called Tony Barber Shop and is ran by 3 racist Mexicans. I walked into the shop and they just looked at me. No hello or anything. I asked for a beard line up (takes 2 minutes) and the guy tried to charge me $14. Man please. Fool isn't written on my forehead. This place was trash.< /text>

<text>This store mostly has obscure board games, Xwing stuff and a few 40k items.  The back room is good sized.  It has an active Kill team and 40k community.  It doesn't have much in the way of RPGs[but they can always order things for you].  I wish it had a better parking situation for its busy nights.<//text><resp>None</resp>< name>

Great little place where you can get pretty much a of your gaming needs. Even has a game room, different game nights every night of the week, and a room to paint miniatures in if you don't have a dedicated space of your own.< /Text>

This place looks small, but is actually really big. Plenty of selection of games. Lots of events and friendly people. Sell Warhammer and MTG here a long with other table top and fantasy games. Check out their event times to go when your favorite game is being played. Great atmosphere, worth checking out!</Text>

< Review>
This little game shop is the perfect place for a family game night as well as for the hard-core tabletop gamer. My first experience was great and every time after has been no different. The manager is friendly and makes an effort to remember your name and will make sure that he can get anything you might be looking for if they don't have it already. Also, there is a good community of friendly competitive players that will take the time to teach any new player the games they love.  The only room for improvement I would point out is for better organization when it comes to events. Other than that, I highly recommend Gaming on Grand.<//Review>

Just met Ted earlier this day. We had a little chat about the games and such. Amazing guy and a really cool place. A friendly environment and a clean place.

I hope it grows and expands even more in the future! - Sam< /Text>

New store trying to cultivate a community of game enthusiasts. They have different game communities that are great for all ages that include D&D, Warhammer 40k, and Magic the Gathering. My brothers and I went it to check it out and ended up spending 2 hours and $120 on cards and proceeding to play a few games. It was a great experience and the owner was very helpful.</Review>

<Review>It's small but mighty! We popped by on our way through town, and it's a gem tucked in on Grand! A very welcoming atmosphere, large space for open play, and a super friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable staff made this a delight in our afternoon.

There is a good selection of merchandise to appeal to all customers - and while the stock may be limited, the staff are completely available and willing to order whatever you might need that you don't see.

It truly is a wonderful little store - this DM was very pleased!<//Review>< pictures>

I wouldn’t even give this store any stars if that were possible. They have been nothing but misleading and straight up lies. We became new Verizon customers last month and they gave us all these “free” items that we didn’t ask for and come to find out they weren’t free at all. Also, they were misleading on prices and “promotions” they had going on. Corporate was just baffled by what they told (read- lied to) us. We will NOT be doing any further business with this store location. Verizon corporate has been helpful with what they could, but unfortunately, couldn’t help with all the lies they spewed. Definitely go to a corporate store location for Verizon wireless and not this location.</Review>

Hands down the BEST experience I ever had at Verizon! When we walked in we were greeted within seconds by the store manager he let us know they were a bit busy but would get to us as fast as possible while my wife and I waited we noticed the amazing service every member of the staff was giving to their customers going above and beyond more than I can say for the corporate locations! After seeing the level of professionalism and great customer service I was excited to get helped! Not only did I receive the same service but the low sales pressure and helpful demeanor of the store manager was amazing and could see why the staff is the way they are. I highly recommend this location to everyone!<//text>

Hands down the BEST Verizon store in the area the store manager Luis is amazing not only did he help me get my daughter a new phone but lowered by Bill by $25.00 spent an hour on the phone with customer service on my behalf resolving an issue that another Verizon store did and got me all taken care of. All the while helping other customers and answering our questions. As I was waiting I noticed that his whole staff is the same way I highly recommend this store ask for Luis. Thank you again< /Review>

Customer service is not a priority at this store. Basically everything you need done they just say they are not a corporate location they can’t do that. I had Verizon device dollars on my account and you can get a new phone from them but you can’t use your rewards. I felt like I was bothering whom said was the GM, Moriah by even coming in the store. She was rude and unhelpful from the get go. Not caring and customer service typically are a bad mix. I will make the drive to a “Corporate location” or anywhere but here if I need anything in the future.< /Text>

I visited this location yesterday, and  there were two Associates that really helped me:  a) load my Grandsons new phone with his applications, and b) They streamlined my bill to "Save me Money!" Ashanique and  Ashton were Outstanding in customer service. I would rate both of them a A+.  Also, I would recommend his location to all in my area.<//review>

My bill went from 150 a month to 360 a month until Verizon technical support fixed everything. Could not get a reciept from them and was told to just wait to see it on my bill.

He walked into a store in a world of hurt and rectified many unhappy customers, that I personally know of, single handedly. There are some real great employees at this location. I adore Ash. He's sweet & tries hard to do the best job he can.
I can't say enough about Michael Hays. You run into a snag or a huge problem, he's your man. Remember he's there to help and if stay calm and work with him, he'll get everything resolved.< /Review>< gmapID>

I went to this store last year and had any horrible experience I was told by a friend that a new manager had taken over the store and she had and incredible experience so I decided to give them another try and let me tell you I wasn't disappointed! It is a full 180 degree change from what it was before the staff ia smiling, friendly professional and most of all knowledgeable and want to help you! I can't thank Will and Luis enough! This is MY Verizon store for myself and friends!<//text>

< Review>
Came in today to put in an insurance claim on my daughters phone. Jyrome assured us even though there was a wait that he would be with us shortly. After a short wait he helped me and actually helped me save money by getting me a new phone ! All in all Jyrome was very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. He turned a terribly frustrating and stressful day into a great one!!! I would 100% recommend him and this store to anyone and everyone!!</Review>

Awesome, experience.  Bought a device called the Hum, for my car. Brian explained the benefits of it, but until I actually used it, it was just another device.   My thoughts at first was not bad for a Bluetooth and a quick diagnostic alert device for my car. Until, I started getting red light notice alerts.  I didn't know something was wrong with my engine. I'm glad I found out that my coolant  had a hole in the pipe. The mechanic said it could have been worse, my engine could have blown. Thanks to the Hum,  it was just my hose that needed to be replaced.  So I just wanted to give Brian big thumbs up for amazing customer service and telling me about the Hum. So if you need a good verizon sales rep, stop by lake Elsinore on collier ave and see Brian. Actually the whole store was awesome. Highly recommended.</text>

Jyrome helped me replace my old phone which had completely died & also to make some much needed changes in my plan. I was expecting the process to be super frustrating because I had so much I needed to get done but he was so helpful & friendly & that really made it a positive experience! Totally genuine people who really want things to work for you in this store.</review>

After going to 3 so called "corporate" offices and being ignored and basically kicked out.I stepped into the store and was greeted with a smile by Luis I went into the store to get some information about my tablet not to buy anything, instead of ignoring me he sat me down on the couch and spent almost an hour with me explaining every little detail and answering every question! This is customer service! So many store are pushy and want to sell you something but will not take the time out of their day to explain and show you how to use your device needless to say this is my ONLY Verizon store and my new friend Luis is my rep for life! I can't say enough about how amazing this store is! Thank you Luis !</text>

I found out a couple of days later that they removed my insurance, added a second line and I was now making payments on 2 lines and my old phone and new phone! They said my bill would only go up $17 per month, it increased from approx $150 per month to $225 per month!! They were obviously banking me not catching on till after the 14 return ran out! I recently turned these guys in to The BBB, Federal Trade Commision, Department of Consumer Affairs and The State Attorney General in California and Nevada. Nevada is their corporate office.

Mikiela at this site was not very helpful, she tried a few things to help me; but did not once call customer service for help or direction. She told me that she couldn’t help me, and sent me to another location. Pretty much did not want to troubleshoot. There was only one other customer in the store at the time. No manager on site either.< /review>

He lied and said I would be able to terminate this new added line in 4 months & still keep the phone & would only have to pay $10 per month for this new line. Turns out I would not have been able to terminate the additional line in 4 months & the cost was actually $30 per month. Good thing I did my own research & was able to cancel within the 3 days without a termination fee. I would never step door in their again, liars & cheaters.

LIARS LIARS LIARS they stole $24.00 from me saying that when I returned a faulty Tablet they couldn't give me the taxes back... that's after trying to charge me a $75.00 "RESTOCKING FEE" for a faulty tablet very ignorant people work there and the other 2 people that I know had the same issue with their tablets and this company too! the tablet when put on no data and running on wi fi will use all your data and that was confirmed by a tear 2 Verizon Tech and these folks denied it and just gave LIE after LIE

Well so far my experience with them they are the worst store I've ever been in they made a mistake a year ago and basically says that I'm on my own ..Good luck if you have to deal with them and while I was waiting for them to tell me that there's nothing they can  or will do about the mistake that they made  I watched one disappointed customer after another< /review>

I put in a pick up order during the lunch rush, ordered steak nachos, and my order was done early. Nacho's freshly made and stacked high enough to feed 3. They gave me several extra sides of salsa and although they didn't have my cherry coke in stock, they allowed me to pick from any other soda I wanted. Customer service was friendly and attentive. I will be back soon.<//text>

<Review>ENORMOUS PORTIONS
Burritos and salads are generous
Salsas could be spicier but it's a bit Americanized so that's fine<//Review>< time>

Excessive plastic take out containers-especially the salads. So unnecessary and I won’t be coming back until Bahia Fresh makes that change.<//Text>

<Review>I hadn't been here before and it was convenient. Ordered an Ultimo burrito. Bland, tasteless and rice with a few vegetables sprinkled in it. Should have gone back to Guisado's instead. Now there's good, tasty and delicious food.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Service was good. Girl was courteous. Food tho, that was just bleh. Inhaled the shrimp bowl and it was mostly a pound of rice sprinkled with various items. The place was clean , can't complain about that. But maybe less rice man....< /text>

A few months ago I gave them 5 stars but I just changed it because I called them around 9:15 pm to order and the guy who answered the phone put me on hold until 9:27 and still didn't come back to the line. So I hang up and called again and no answer! And now it is already passed their closing time and still no answer. Thanks a lot!< /Review>

<review>I really cannot put into words how well Luis helped me with my massive catering order on such short notice. Really appreciate the effort of him and his team for exceeding my expectations of not only being immensely patience on explaining how the catering menu works, but also on helping me load my car. Such a positive experience, will not hesitate on returning.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Service left a little to be desired. Cashier was on the phone when I came in. When she finally was done, she asked "can I help you?", then immediately turned around to call out someone else's order. If you're not going to help me, don't ask! It took several more minutes to get someone else to help me. Total wait time till my order was taken was about 7 minutes...with nobody else in line!!! And to add further insult, the tortilla chips that come with meal were chewy rather than crispy (not fully cooked). At least they got the "no veggie mix" part of my burrito order correct.< /Review>< pics>

Baja fresh always has good fast food, good service. This location was below average. The salsa bar was a little picked over and my burrito had a lot of rice in it but otherwise it was a good experience with the wait staff.</review>

The food... is OK BUT: I had a Burrito that was not wrapped properly, resulting in the food pouring out of the opposite side as I was trying to eat.
I like to go to Baja Fresh occasionally, but this location is definitely off my list.< /Review><Response>None</Response>< Time>

Not bad for being fast food. Their Primo Grilled Shrimp salad with Chile Lime sauce is pretty good. Their burritos are just average, I prefer Chipotle's.<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I have been receiving emails regarding changes made during the COVID, apparently, the only email that I failed to read was the fee changes? I have been a member of this gym for over 3 years, and I have been paying the basic $9.99 fee. Recently, I woke up to a charge of $19.99, which I didn't agree to and I did not sign on, and now, I woke up with a charge of $58.99, apparently, an annual fee THAT I HAVE NEVER PAID IN THE PAST. It is very unfortunate that I have trusted the gym with my bank account information for many years, and for them to think it is okay to just start charging any fees without ANY SIGNED agreement or authorization. They have definitely broken the trust that I had in them.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80945da5243f9a2d:0xe4d43ff9736ae74b</GmapID></record>

<review>A decently serviceable gym, but THERE IS NO BOXING EQUIPMENT as the photos would suggest. As I signed up for that purpose and was told it would be present, I am dissatisfied paying for a gym membership I will likely not use as much, after being bait-and-switched.

The rest of the equipment works..but for 50 a month I would have hoped for more amenities than your standard planet fitness level gym.
Best of luck.<//review>< user_name>

< Review>
Just had to leave this place because I was asked to download an app to answer questions about covid symptoms. First off how is this barely a requirement? And second you seen I was in a rush in a time crunch and kinda annoyed being asked to do that before I can enjoy my workout... Why couldn't they ask me the questions and allow me to download the app when I had the time... Horrible customer service I give this location a Tumbs down very disappointed I really needed to workout since my day was soo stressful!! Thinking of changing gyms at this point!!< /Review>

Fair. Has what you need. Down side. The other fit republic had more weights if I am using a machine the ones next to me won't have any weights.  bathrooms could be cleaned. Not my style  will stick to the other one.</text>

< Review>
Been going for a year and I know about the submitting my withdrawal from the club.  I also think 15 a month is good.  Sauna is usually out of order.  Not getting warm enough in there.  And the ropes for the resistant machines are worn down.  With that many members you gotta keep up with the demand.  Smooth Bar is great  decent prices.  They have energy drinks,  water,  other drinks to fuel you.  They have a new gym at the old Sierra club on blackstone but you must be a platinum member. Massage chair is great to have access to. I hate that they don't have a better area to stretch.  I was a blast fitness member and they had a massage table and a stretch stationary  machine.  I was able to fully stretch everything!  All in all not bad could be better still enjoy it there.<//Review>

<text>Ive been going here for around 2 years, and 2 years at the clovis location before that. Both gyms have what i want, are decently clean, friendly staff anf have never had issues with payments. I would like it if there was more space to do more body weight exercises and also more benches but what they have now is good.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

You guys really need to do something about your opening employees! They are constantly late to open, I'm not talking about a few minutes. Sometimes it's been 15 to 20 min past 5 am and there is no one there yet! For some of us this is the only time we have to work out. Please do something about this asap! Right at this moment I'm waiting outside your facility and you have yet to open.</Review>

Their BOXING program is FANTASTIC! Full body workouts: cardio, strength, stretching, abs, and of course, boxing! For beginners, fighters, and anyone who just wants to get in shape. Friendly, stress-free environment. They WON'T throw you in the ring to get beat up. They make sure you have a foundation of knowledge to pull from, and then put you in with an experienced person who can go to YOUR level and not try to knock you out, IF you want to spar (practice fight). The boxing class is Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 4-6pm, Tuesday & Thursday 7:30pm to 9pm, and Saturday from 10am to 11:30am.<//Review>

I love coming to this gym, mainly for the EvoFit class! The instructor Victor is awesome and very motivational. Along with my own hard work and determination, Victor has helped me reach my goals every month, and continues to do so! Highly recommend coming and checking out this class!!</Text>

<Time>1516734464930< /Time><review>The gym itself was clean and very usable, the extra classes were great as well. My problem was with the staff that signed me up, they did not tell me everything I needed to know or the extra charges associated with the membership. When my work changed me over to a corporate membership, fit republic charged me an extra month and a service fee even though my account was frozen. I have been waiting for 2 months for a refund from the fit Republic corporate office, there are no phone numbers to contact anyone at fit Republic, the only number they give you is to a third party billing service so there is no way to contact corporate office. The staff at the gym has emailed several times since that is the only way that they can get ahold of them and at this point they have still refused to refund the amount of credit on my account. Fit Republic corporate are horrible people to work with, they are quick to take your money but refuse to refund any overcharges.< /review>< Rate>

One consistent thing at Fitness Evolution is the staff SUCKS at every single one I've been to, that's 4 of them.  The gym itself is just fine but the staff acts like you are bothering them every time you call or go to the desk to inquire about the description or time of classes, when some gym locations don't list classes online so you HAVE to call.<//review>

<Text>I became a member as soon as they opened the Ashlan location. Jumped on the 14.99 premium special. I asked if they took credit cards, they said yes. So I handed them my credit card and they took my info. 2 months later I hadn't been billed once so I went in to ask them what's going on. I was told sometimes it takes a while to process you should be fine. Suddenly I'm getting calls for late fees and unpaid membership fees. Time to talk to a manager.

This place in particular is a joke. I work 6 days a week from morning till evening. Since I'm busy it was impossible to talk to a manager. That manager was never there, even on days they told me would be best to find her, I'd go and they told me she left early. Finally I see her and ask her what happened. She says they don't take credit cards and I'll have to pay all the fees including late fees. Oh and also the annual $40 dollar fee, don't let them sneak that one by you. It's required for everyone. I basically had to pay for one of their employees mistake. I told them just cancel my membership and suddenly the amount due jumped way up. I told them go screw yourself.

Talked to a manager at the Clovis place and they were much more helpful and offered me a deal to stay and they'd erase the late fees. That was fair but I didn't have a chance to go to arrange that due to my schedule. So in just days I got taken to collections and had to pay just under $400. Their collection agency is even worse! They call you out of nowhere and demand that you pay right then and there or they'll report it on your credit.

All over just a horrible experience. Don't get fooled by the 10 dollar membership and no contracts. There's the 40 dollar annual fee and they want your debit card on file for automatic withdrawal. The employees at Ashlan in particular can't be more than 1 month out of high school. Just look at the reviews, avoid this scam gym.</Text>< Pics>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Beware of this gym. They will lure you in with their low prices, and charge you a monthly membership fee FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. Their unwritten cancellation policy requires that you speak with a manager before they will agree to stop charging your credit card. This would be fine if the manager was ever in the office/returned phone calls. They are scamming the people of Fresno, and it is really unfortunate that businesses like this continue to operate while blatantly stealing from customers.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Horrible experience! This company promises no contracts but instead has hidden agreements in their cancellation policy. If you do not cancel according to the manner of their agreement then they continue charging you. They will keep racking up the charges and then send you to collections!! I went only (1) time to their gym and due to dissatisfaction I stopped going there. I called to cancel and they told me it was okay since it was month to month but never told me that I had to submit a request in writing....6 months later I get a phone call from a collection agency asking for $229!!!!! I called the manager at this location and was told "there is nothing they can do"!!! This gym is ripping people off and being dishonest. This corporation lacks integrity and does NOT know the true meaning of customer service.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Terrible Gym, they say that they will waive the membership sign up fee but charge you a years membership fee once you are only 2 months into the gym membership. They say No contract but if you're charging membership fee's then I guess you are in a contract. I don't trust this gym</Text>< Pics>

<text>I brought my teen daughter in for somewhat of a hair emergency, she is on a professional competing dance team & had tried to "correct" a bleach job she did herself a few months back, by using an "amplified" heavy bleach product on her own hair (using bleach on one side) in a split color style.  Her hair is naturally a beautiful shade of brown & one side was now black & the other side reddish blonde & we had to get her hair "fixed" ASAP for upcoming dance competitions!   Jose was wonderful, he was kind & understanding & knew exactly what to do!   I will add photos to show how beautiful her hair turned out after he fixed it!  This was also my daughter's first professional salon experience (I tried to get her into the professional salon in the past & she refused & only wanted to color her own hair).  After this great experience with Joses' care, recommendations &  expertise she now loves the idea of returning in the future for regular professional hair care, styling & if coloring, only by Jose!  This was absolutely a miracle experience for Mom, too!  Sighs of relief & much gratitude to Jose!<//text><Date>1620541380261</Date></record>

This was my second trip to this salon.  Like the first time, it was the best salon experience I have ever had.  As before, I was cautious due to the pandemic, but again, I was very impressed.  The staff was professional,  the inside was spotlessly clean and bright, and all COVID procedures were being followed.  I absolutely loved the haircut I received.  Alma, who helped me, was great.  She was attentive, funny, and really listened to me.  I will definitely continue to go there.<//Text>

Very disappointing experience. Not only great stylists are no longer with the business but also they have double standards. It was ok for the stylist to run late last time for 15 mins but it is NOT ok for me to run late today for 5-7 mins. Instead of canceling when I called they waited till I showed up. It seems that the stylist did not feel comfortable cutting my hair this time because I had to ask her to fix some of the parts of her last job? It’s just very disappointing and far from being professional. I hope double standard will be rooted out.< /review>

I'm so happy Hair International is back open! They are taking all the necessary precautions to keep everyone safe. Upon arriving, I had a quick temperature check and health screening. Everyone is wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and sanitizing their hands. I felt very safe and comfortable during my highlights touch up, and as always the results are beautiful thanks to Emma's skillful work.</Text>

She took her time with my hair and was very delicate with it from start to end. All of the staff were super friendly and helpful during my time there. Most definitely recommend this salon and Emily!< /review>< Pics>

<text>Had another great experience at Hair International. Emma did a fantastic job with coloring and cutting my hair. It turned out exactly how I wanted it. She was quick but also paid attention to the small details. I will definitely come back.

Huge shout out to the owner, Pam. She is so friendly and nice! Always looking to make sure her customers are happy.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb4VCrBQxNlChPnOfMJL-pLVXFgFif6-JVTgOJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<text>This is probably the worst hair salon in Palo Alto / Menlo Park.  Think twice before you go.  I asked for a simple men's haircut. Blend in the top and no lines. After the hairdresser went crazy on the left side, I stopped her and told her that it was completely uneven and way too short on the top. She called for help and left. You can see the result in the pictures.

The other hairdresser told me she could fix it, and she started cutting the right side which only made it more uneven.

This salon is a conveyor belt with very questionable skills. Plenty of other places I would rather go.< /text>< pics>

{'time': 1581298798040, 'text': "Hello Anders,\n\nI am so sorry you had a bad experience today! I looked back into the records and saw that you had seen two stylists. I think this may be a serious stylist -client miscommunication. It's not typical but it does happen, since we are all human, but I certainly apologize very much.\n\nBoth of the stylists have been at the salon for more than 15 years, so the problem isn't talent or training, or even experience, but everyone is different, has a different need and communicates differently. I also noticed that we are actually not your regular salon, since you haven't been to see us since 2017, so  it's possible that you have a favorite salon or salons that you frequent and probably have several stylists who have experience with your hair and your preferences for style and finished look. That's a hard experience to re-create sometimes.\n\nIn any case, we would really appreciate the opportunity to make this better for you, and to see if we can't turn this bad time for you around. If you are open to it, and only when you are ready, perhaps you might be willing to see our Master barber Rabi - he has 20 years experience in men's styling and he's just awesome! If you can see your way to allowing this, please email me at hairintlpaloalto@gmail.com and I will personally book that appt  for you.\n\nThank you for your feedback Anders, again, I apologize for this bad time and sure hope you're willing to give Rabi a shot.\n\nPam\nHair International"}< /Response>

<review>If you want a great Agave Treatment & threading, you have to see ATENA. Hands down the best Agave I have ever had. Silky smooth, shiny hair with lasting results is what you will get. She's amazing with threading. Love the attention to detail. Nothing like some great looking brows to frame your face.<//review>< pictures>

I arrived a bit early and helped myself to some chocolate. They had a huge bowl at reception. mmmm. Emma greeted me a few minutes later. She did such a great job with my cut and color! She helped me choose the right toner for my hair, and I absolutely love how it turned out!</text>

<text>I recently had a hair cut and balayage done by Jesse and couldn’t be happier! When I got there I showed him what I wanted and he was very knowledgeable and accurate on what he needed to do. I will definitely be going back for my future touch ups.

I had a wonderful experience at Hair International! I had been talking about getting highlights done for a long time, but never got around to it. Finally, I scheduled an appointment with Tracey and I could not be happier with the results. I only wish I had done it sooner. The highlights look so natural and lit up my whole face. It was exactly what I wanted- I received a ton of complements on my hair but not on the highlights (because it looked so natural!)</Text>

I honestly don't leave reviews and I have never had a bad hair experience but I feel like I need to write one for this...Went here for highlights and a natural look and after the hairstylist spent hours tugging at my hair (to the point that I had a major headache) I left feeling like absolutely nothing had been done. It looked ombré (which I said I did not want) and was much too warm for what I had asked for. As it was $240 I did not feel like I was happy enough with it, so I called the next day to set up a redo appointment. I got a call the morning of the appointment from my original stylist and she stated she didn't have time to do my hair that day and I could either wait a week until she could do it or go with a different stylist. I decided to go with the stylist she had recommended and I could not be more unhappy with my results. Before this experience, I have always loved my hair and this made me feel so absolutely horrified and self-conscious. I asked for natural looking highlights and ended up with a streaky looking disaster. You can actually SEE the parts where she just stopped highlighting. Absolutely no blending was done and it looked absolutely terrible. There are some amazing hair stylists here but some apparently don't know what they're doing. I ended up dying over this disaster IMMEDIATELY after it was done because I just didn't want to deal with going back. Such a waste of money and time and I'm so disappointed with the entire experience.<//Text>

{'time': 1498452581714, 'text': "Hi Keelin,\n\nGosh, this sounds terrible! I looked you up in our computer and confirmed that you had been in and then had your hair re-done today. I'm so sorry that you didn't like it. I REALLY wish you had not colored over it. There are so many options with color and highlights, but we lose some of them by going darker [but only if it's TOO dark.]\n\nIf you don't mind contacting us directly at hairintlpaloalto@gmail.com, we will make arrangements to refund the money you spent on coloring your hair back to you - I'm assuming you were please with your haircut since you did not mention any problems - that was included in the price of 240 dollars, and was 65 dollars. If you have time, you might want to come in and see our color Director, Alma. I know she can help determine what your options are, and offer you some potential choices you might like better than what you have now. I'm sure she'll be happy to help in any way she can.\n\nColoring is a bit of an art and there are so many variables to consider, but at the very least the color line we use is Goldwell, and considered the best in the world. It's German, and the EU requirements are much higher and more rigourousthan ours here in the US. Goldwell tends to leave hair in very good condition, just because it's filled with buffers and glossers, so you still might be able to try for the original highlight you were after. Alma is the person to see for this.\n\nOnce again, I'm so, so sorry this wasn't a great experience for you. At the very least, refunding what you paid for your color will hopefully remove some of the discomfort, and seeing Alma might help, as well.\n\nLet me know, OK?\n\nPam\nHair International"}<//Resp>

<text>My new favorite hair salon! I got the honor to be styled by Sarah Homa, a very sweet and talented woman. Right off the bat I could tell she knew what she was doing and how she would handle my hair, which was not in good condition. She led me though the process letting me know everything she was doing step by step, which I thought was very professional of her because that made me aware of exactly what she was doing. When I saw the end result I was speechless! I could not believe she made my hair look that good. I definitely recommend coming in to this salon. I know that I will definitely be back!<//text><UserId.>105292678713962945028</UserId.>< Time>

<review>I came to Hair International and saw Jose and loved his haircut. He is extraordinary, not only is he sweet, but he is passionate about hair and you can see it in his practice. I was looking for a all over haircut on my ends and he shaped my hair in a style that fits my face so well. His blow dry was enjoyable and admirable I hadn't had a blow dry quite like his before. He does great work if your looking for a good stylist I recommend Jose for all hair types.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>Came here for a "Deva cut" with Sarah. It wasn't the worst haircut I've had, but don't waste your money on a Deva cut here. Sarah did cut my hair dry, but combed all of the curls out within an inch of their life before she started cutting. My hair was a frizzy disaster. After the post-cut wash, she got impatient letting it dry gently and took a blow dryer (no diffuser) to it.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1582416904079, 'text': "Hello Rebecca!\n\nI'm so sorry you didn't like your Devacut. To be honest, the classic [requiring certification]  Deva training requires hair to be cut cut dry. I myself have very curly hair, and I prefer a traditional curly/wavy haircut with a curly specialist - the Devacut doesn't work for me when done as outlined by Deva, and as a hairstylist myself I'm not a big fan of dry cuts either. Every stylist does this work according to his/her own judgement, so Sarah is clearly not the right stylist for you.\n\nIt looks like you came in about a month ago, so you might be needing a trim soon. Our curly/wavy specialists are Alma, Emma, Atena and Jesse. If you wouldn't mind emailing me at hairintlpaloalto@gmail.com or texting at 5403242007, I'm sure there is something we can do for you with one of these other curly/wavy specialists that will make you much happier.\n\nAgain, sorry about you not loving your Devacut - hopefully you will give us the opportunity to make this better for you.\n\nHave a wonderful weekend,\nPam\nHair International"}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I was worried that my hair would not turn out the color I wanted because I naturally have really dark hair, but my stylist Jose was so patient and made sure the color would turn out ashy and more cool toned, which I really appreciated. The transition/blend from my roots to the rest of my hair is absolutely perfect and I wouldn’t have wanted it to look any other way! Definitely a 10/10.

I really really wish I had taken a before and after picture of my hair because it was that much of a transformation! A few things, first of all, the location is so ideal. Before or after your beauty appointment you can roam the shopping center or grab some lunch. It is a beautiful center and the shop itself is in a prime location. Pam is the owner of the salon, we had been talking previously and she is such a sweetheart. She made very clear notes in my profile about what I wanted and made scheduling so easy. I had been booked with Jesse for a cut and some toning. My hair was previously very brassy and I wanted a more dark chocolate brown look and I also wanted some layers for dimension. Jesse showed me a color book so he could have the best idea of what I wanted and that's exactly what he did for me. My cut was beautiful! Layered, dimensional, bouncy. I have no bad things to say about my hair. I went to lunch after my hair appointment and my sister was definitely interested in going to Jesse for her next cut! Overall, Hair International, I am so pleased. I'll be back!<//Review>

Horrible experience. The stylist rushed through the shampoo, was very rough in handling the hair. Ended with a kiddie haircut despite requesting to go short at the back. Refused to understand insisting that she will have to shave it for that when my hair was long enough for the requested hair cut. At the end was told ‘I am not good with a blow dry and sent off with a shoddy one’. Very poor experience.< /review>

Good place for your hair style. I would recommend walk in as it is much cheaper unless you really wanna rock star happy cut. Paid 35$ for a great experienced stylist. Which is not bad at all. I am not sure if they have anywhere else than Stanford shopping mall.<//Text>

this place is a joke. Mary didn't even know how to do the simplest form of fade around my neck. I asked many times for her to fix the very clear 5" line she left in my hair. She thought it was acceptable and good enough and kept arguing that it is faded just fine and that she is not a barber... I should not have walked in here, but I thought situated as such a location, it could not possibly be such a colossal fail.</text>

Hair International has always provided me with excellent service, but let me tell you, Becky took it to a whole new level. Not only did she squeeze me in before seeing a regular client. She gave me the best shampoo wash I have ever had. Not the 1-2 minute wash you come to expect when getting a haircut, but at least a full four-five minutes. It was like getting a massage, I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep.  She quickly and expertly cut my hair and styled it in less then 30 minutes. I can only imagine what she'll do when I schedule an appointment with her in a few months.<//review>

I've had many wonderful haircuts here! My stylist, Shelly, always does a great job with whatever style we want to attempt. Getting haircuts is often difficult for me because I really need a style that requires basically no maintenance at all. (Between bike helmets, lunchtime workouts, and a laissez-faire attitude towards my hairstyle, I can't be counted on to do anything more elaborate than drag a comb through my hair every once in a while.) Shelly has been super great about working with me to find hairstyles that are both cute and low-maintenance. I would highly recommend her work!< /review>

This is really the best place to go if you want your hair cut or colored right. I’ve been to plenty of salons and it seemed that if I didn’t go here, overseas was practically my only other option for a proper razor cut. As for coloring, I don’t dye my hair but I like to play with highlights and wanted a balayage-ombré mix. Again, this is the place to go. Jose knew off the top what I wanted with hardly any explanation and did it efficiently. Hannah handled her razor like a pro. Props to both for their professionalism, consideration of my wants, friendliness and knowing how to make my hair look great. They actually had to clean up a previous cut and highlight I’d done a month before, and the trip here was well worth it. I’d recommend Hair International, and especially Jose and Hannah to anyone wanting a great, not just a good hair cut or color. Thank you guys.< /Review>

Usually, I do not have an exact idea of what type of haircut or style I want, so I let Pam do whatever she thinks fits me the best.  The end result is always a wonderful haircut and great conversation!  I never feel rushed and the wait is never long.  Pam keeps me coming back!</Text><response>None<//response>< pics>

Unbelievable experience! Every time I go in it is such a fun loving and embracing environment. The talent that this salon holds is truly remarkable. I have been in a few times now and always walk out feeling amazing. I went in with just needing a change and I got just that! The compliments have been non stop and I truly feel as if the stylist just get me.< /review>

<response>None</response><review>Walk-in appointments are super convenient - never have to wait more than 15-20 minutes, even when I have a specific request. The stylists are friendly and fun - I've had my hair colored here several times (funky pinks, reds and purples) and always get tons of compliments. The owner Pam is amazing - best stylist I've ever had and a genuinely great person. It's hard to find someone I trust to do a short feminine cut right, but with her I always leave happy.<//review>< pics>

Love this salon! I'm super picky about my color (being a blonde) and it's hard to find someone who listens and takes their time in the consultation to help give you what you want! Jesse is a rockstar -- see him for amazing color.</Text>

Lindsey is an absolute gem. She not only completely understood the color and cut I WANTED, but also made suggestions to slightly alter the cut to make it look best on me and make it functional in the way that I wanted. Hands down the best haircut I have ever had - I went in slightly terrified of cutting several inches off and walked out completely over the moon with how it turned out.<//review>

<review>I love Hair International! I get my hair done every time I come visit the bay, I live out of the country and still refuse to get my hair done anywhere else! Everyone is super nice here, and they're all professionals filled with patience. You feel like a whole new person when stepping off that chair, and I don't think anywhere else can do as good of a job as fairly and professionally, and make me feel as confident!! Definitely come here</review>< date>

I'd been thinking of getting my hair dyed for YEARS but with the right consultation and very caring hands, Jesse gave me the color (and transformation) that I didn't even know I was looking for! He was calm and very receptive to my hesitations, but any fears I had quickly went out the window as he got to work. From fixing something my (ex) barber had done to really giving me that shine and gradient that you see in the hair style magazines (you know the ones!), I am over the moon with this experience. That, and the chocolates that Pam has in stock will definitely have me coming back. A million thank yous to Jesse for his amazing work!</Review>

<username>Amia Nash< /username><review>I have loved my experience at Hair International! I have received incredible customer service, fast response time for scheduling appointments, and a warm welcome every time I have entered the salon!
I got my hair cut and styled by Pam and she was able to educate me about how I can style my own hair. I showed her some examples of the look I wanted and she gave me exactly that! She is so kind and I loved talking with her during my appointment!
I have also had my eyebrows threaded by Atena, and her work is amazing! I had been looking around for good eyebrow threading in the mid-peninsula, and now I only want to go to Atena! She also did my make up for an event and I was so impressed, I loved my final look!
I look forward to coming back to Hair International!<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5OK3r63vbksYBONkNlRXQPO-5bxgYrlSdwqTf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><GmapID>0x808fbb346e2fa165:0xcdd2f3490e222747< /GmapID></record>

I had an appointment with Martha, and I am beyond happy. Martha was patient, kind, knowledgeable, personable and has a good vision for hair when you describe what you would like. This was by far the best salon I've been to and Martha did such a great job on my hair. On top of that, the environment at the salon is very welcoming and professional. I got very natural highlights with a healthy looking layered cut. Very satisfied with this experience at Hair Intrnational and will definitely book with Martha again!</Review>

I was visiting Hair International in my trip to California. When I travel abroad, especially to US, it is difficult to arrange my hair du to the fact I can not take my styling products with me therefore I booked an appointment in Hair International. I had the chance to meet there the famous Mike Vallance, a styling designer from UK, he came to train the girls here in Palo Alto. He worked for more than 4 hours, changed my hair colour, cut and styling and the result is absolutely amazing!!!I just love it! Thank you so much for your time and efforts, I strongly recommend the place!</review>

<Text>Went for hair styling ( only little blow dry and curls) and they charged me 95$. I had already washed my hair and so I didn’t get hair wash done. Also the stylist offered her personal number asking me to come home if I need any haircut.. will never go back there. 95$ she said my hair was long n she did a lot of work. Never expected. When I called they said price is around 60+ depending on the hair length.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Just got my hair colored for the first time in years after a bad experience years ago, and I couldn't be more excited! I brought in some photos with ideas of what kind of highlights/balayage I wanted and stylist Lindsey Johnson did an incredible job with blending and nailed the shade of blonde! She was incredibly friendly and the conversation throughout was wonderful.
I would highly recommend for coloring, she even blended my cut for me and styled me with awesome curls! The environment is lively and very friendly staff.
I will definitely be going back for cuts and future coloring!
Thank you!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

They said as long as I’m not later than 15mins it’s ok. When arrived 10mins late, my stylist Renee already had her next customer and told me she can’t take me anymore. Sorry but I have been tipping you well since years and now you can’t accommodate me? You lost not only one but two customers. Bye</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>
{'time': 1559515987527, 'text': "Hello Kolja,\nI'm, so sorry you had a negative experience today. I just gave the salon a call, and spoke to Renee. Renee just felt that  she needed a specific amount of time to cut your hair - she feels that it is challenging hair to get perfect, and she didn't want to make any errors. Renee has been at the salon for more than 15 years, and she books at least an hour for her haircuts - all of them, which is very unusual for any stylist. She's just not someone that rushes any of her work. Her clients really like this, although it's not for everyone! Renee really does want to make this better for you, so if you don't mind emailing us at hairintlpaloalto@gmail.com or texting to 6503031858 to speak directly that  would be great."}<//response>

A very good salon. Experienced staff. I went with my sister to get a haircut and balayage. They did a really good job. Would definitely recommend Emma if you are looking to Color your hair. It was my first time colouring my hair. She took this into consideration and gave me a very natural balayage. My sister got a haircut which was also done very nicely. Staff really listens to what you want.</Review>

They do a great job! No matter who has worked on my hair, I've always liked it. However, I find it a bit too pricy for a very simple, standard men's haircut. I come here when I really need the haircut done right.<//Review>

I can always rely on Hair International. After getting a disastrous haircut, I got it fixed by Tiffany. Not only was she patient, she was also very knowledgeable about hair styles, textures and what would fit my hair type best. She listened  to what I was looking for in my new haircut. Really loved getting my hair done with her! Will definitely come again< /Review>

I have been going there for years, I always do the drop in because I don't have to make an appointment and go whenever I need and have time for it.  And every single person who cut my hair made it look great !!! I started going as a student and loved the discount, and still now that i'm not a student anymore i still love going there. Everyone is great and professional :)</Text>

I was a walk-in, needing a trim. I got Becky, and I am so pleased with her service. She is very nice and careful about details. I am from out of town, but I would definitely have kept her as my regular stylist.Needless to say, my hair looked and felt amazing after my appointment. So super happy with my visit!</Text>

I went to Hair International because I'm a man with long hair and I needed my neck and sideburns cleaned up. I showed up for my appointment, and sat down. The stylist did not even wet my hair to create a clean part, ask me how high up I wanted her to clip my sideburns. Instead, she went right in with clippers. The haircut was brisk and did not feel like she was putting in much thought at all. While doing my neckline, she pressed the clippers against my neck so hard and went over the skin so many times that my shirt collar had light bloodstains when I got home. The next day, I slicked my hair back to discover that the right sideburn is unevenly cut and the shaved portion rises a full half inch above my ear. The left side is great. But now, at least until my hair grows back, I am walking around with a ridiculously uneven sideburn. I truly regret giving this place my business, and I will be finding a different place to get my hair cut. I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of service I paid for. Don't waste your money, and more importantly, the time it will take for your hair to grow back after they F*** it up!< /text>

<Text>I'm recalling about my experience with Hair International this October. It is still hurting and probably the worst experience I've had in years. Initially I made an appointment with Sandie, but when I got there, the front desk told me that somehow the appointment system went wrong and my appointment got canceled. They then had Tracey to cut my hair. She was very nice at the beginning, but somehow when I was trying to describe the hair style I wanted with more details, she became very impatient and didn’t pay attention to me at all. I was trying to discuss with her, but she said: “Look, I don’t have time for that. You should make your decision before you come for a haircut, a nail appointment or whatsoever so that you don’t waste other people’s time.” She was incredibly rude. Of course, the haircut I got at the end was very disappointing. I would never go back to this salon.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808fbb346e2fa165:0xcdd2f3490e222747< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I couldn’t get out of there fast enough - one side of my hair was 2 inches shorter than the other and they butchered the ends. That’s the time I ever try to save money on a hair cut. The only positive thing I have to say about it is that the place seemed clean.<//review>

I purchased a groupon to have the agave treatment done and my stylist did not tell me that it was going to straighten out my hair. I thought it was going to deeply condition it. I was very very unhappy with the results and felt very self conscious about myself afterwards. So much so I decided to cut all my hair off into a pixie cut. I loved my long hair I just needed some hydration. I called them before I cut my hair into a pixie to see if there was anything that could be done and nothing could be done. I didn't get a refund or a gift certificate - nothing to make it up. It was an awful experience.< /Review>
<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1502476952467, 'text': "Hello Vanessa,\n\nI'm so sorry you didn't like your Agave treatment. It does straighten and smooth hair quite a bit, but actually, it wears off slowly after 3 months or so. It is not permanent. It is very similar to the Brazilian /blow-dry, although it is completely non-toxic. It is a great service and most people love it, but it is totally not solely a deep conditioning treatment, although it does have those properties too.\n\nIf you will email me at hairintlpaloalo@gmail.com  or text at 6503242007 we will absolutely give you a gift certificate for the value of the Agave, which you can use on services, products or even give as a gift to someone else. We really want to be happy and will certainly try and make this up to you!\n\nOnce again, apologies for perhaps not explaining fully what the Agave Oil treatment does and how it works.\n\nHope to hear from you soon,\n\nPam\nHair International"}<//Response>< Gmap_id>

I called ahead of time and requested someone who can cut very thin hair (I have the typical German blond thin hair). They told me Tracy can cut hair like that.
So envision this:
In the back she cut 3 inches a piece off, not symmetric but randomly. So it looks like a little kid took a pair of scissors and kept shorten my hair. Then she dried my hair that a half bowl was in the top and a little bit of hair (2 inch long) show up at the bottom. Regardless to say that the bottom 2 inch were so thinned out that you can look through it. To top off this hair style Tracy left the length of my fringe and just split them in half and commend my fringes like a triangle flat to my forehead. Who does that?
Regardless to say it WAS UGLY!!
I will never enter this shop again.</Text>

<text>My 13yr old daughter was scheduled for an cut&hair coloring/dye with the stylist by the name of Carrie time. The meet&greet between them both went south when Carrie racial profiled her,and,or discriminated my daughter by stated to her that she cannot do her hair because she have black people hair&her hair is nappy!!!
This was my daughter 1st time at this establishment, and in addition this was her 1st time hair salon experience,an epic fail INDEED c/o your stylist Carrie Everheardt that lacked the top 3 job descriptions that businesses seek in an employee that is representing their brand...
1.)positive attitude
2.)team player
3.)customer service skills
Following Carrie Everheardt unprofessional work ethics re: her racist slurs,discrimination comments,harassment, and many other factors that I can hold her&the company accountable for,the salon lost not only an potential client,but money also.
To whom it may concern I do not recommend Hair International in Palo Alto, Ca which resides at the Stanford Mall,period.This is solely my opinion on behalf of my 13yr old daughter,in discussion of the hair stylist,Carrie Everheard< /text>< pics>

I am sure Carrie will be horrified to know that you and your daughter felt this way - after all, she is African-American herself, and certainly has felt discrimination herself. Carrie has a very large African-American clientele and has never had one problem like this - in fact, she's pretty popular with just about all her clients. She see a fair amount of kids, too, so she would not want to hurt a child in any way. I think Carrie's style and personality is very open and straight-forward - she doesn't  hide what she's thinking. This is totally the wrong stylist for your daughter. I will over you this. We have another African-America stylist and although she is on leave right now, she would be happy to come in and see your daughter. She is very calm and quiet. Both of them are excellent stylists, but completely different personalities. Once again, I'm so sorry your daughter's experience was not positive.

<user>118018613140226224308< /user><review>Ive been getting my hair done here for a while and i ~love~ this place--im moving to Daly City soon but absolutely will make the drive to come here! Ive truly only had positive experiences and they always do whatever they can to accommodate. Theyre super receptive to feedback and always tell me I can come back to get things fixed if I don't like them. I just had my hair bleached for the first time and they did a stellar job--they redid the toner without hesitation when i expressed I was hoping for an ashier blonde.
Might take you a couple tries to find your perfect stylist (but honestly I've liked them all!), but once you do, it's the only high quality, mid-priced haircut you can find in the area. I get compliments on my hair constantly and i seriously love this salon; all the people working there are so kind, good to talk to, careful, and invested in what they do. Go!!< /review>< username>

I had a hair challenge. The lower end of my hair still have some leftover blonde from my balayage from last year and I did not want to cut it short. My hair is naturally black. I wanted to lighten my hair but the color needs to blend in with the blonde tips. I explained my situation to Carrie (who by the way is hilarious!) and she came up with a solution and did not disappoint! She did a full highlight on my hair that perfectly blended with the current blonde like they were done at the same time. It was PERFECT! She also works fast and efficient. I love her because she always make sure that she understands what you would like done and give suggestions of what can look better or would not look good on you and I am always happy with the end result.</text>

<text>Bad and expensive service. The lady who helped me could not speak English, the prices of dyeing my hair took almost 2, lasted less than 2 weeks and costed 50 dollars.

In all the salon visit I made here, today is the only day I was not satisfied with my hair. An asian lady did my hair (totally forgot her name) and totally didnt do well! I have a really thick hair and she didnt blow dry it like the other two girls who does my hair regularly. She said its $60 dollars to get it blow dry, i told her Carrie blow dry it nicely and makes my layers comes out for only $35 and so is the other lady who cut my hair before. She redo the blow dry but seemed upset that I felt like she was pulling my hair. She asked me at the end if its okay, I just said yes coz iwanted to get the hell out of there coz I am pissed off already. I will still come here but I know who can only touch my hair....only Carrie.</Review>

Some stylists have different prices, maybe you didn't know that, but if you are happy with Carrie [she's an AMAZing stylist!] I would book my appts and stay with her. All stylists have different personalities and I think Carrie has a wonderful way with people plus being a great stylist/ colorist.\n\nThe next time you visit, Carrie will not charge you for your blow-dry to make up for your inconvenience. Please book that directly through me, Pam, at hairintlpaloalto@gmail.com, and i will make sure all goes well. Don't go directly through the desk, OK?\n\nWe strongly advise making an appt with some stylists. They are so popular  - and with good reason! I will look up who do see you yesterday and have a word with her. she needs to use this as an opportunity to grow!\n\nWhen you go back to Carries and she does her usual terrific job, maybe you can give her five stars!\n\nHave a wonderful Christmas Eve,\n\nPam\nHair International\nhairintlpaloalto@gmail.com"}< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>The stylist wouldn't even listen to what I wanted; She just started hacking away. And then when I told her to just stop, she started blaming me for not explaining clearly. Luckily hair grows back, and I have an asymetrical cut (and she only touched the short side), but I'll never come back here.< /text>< UserId.>

First impression always matter. I came in wanting to schedule a hair consultation appointment with any hair stylist. I received a quick walk in consultation with an available represntive named Carrie Everheardt, and it was just awful! I've never gotten my hair dyed at a professional salon before (only at home) and first began my conversation by telling her that I had I've never dyed my hair professionally and had no clue what a highlight, low light, bleaching etc. I described to her what I wanted and showed her examples of what I also wanted. She shut down all of my ideas but stating that it I don't know what I want, than she can't help me with my decisions. I started at her and thoguhts to myself, "isn't that what a consultation is for?". I imidetly felt insecure and unsure of dying my hair if a "professional" couldn't help me or atleast lead me onto what I should start of with. Never again!</text>

{'time': 1469821167218, 'text': "Hi Abigail,\n\nSorry to hear about your experience at the salon! Carrie definitely has a strong personality. She is popular, but not everyone stylist and client are a good match - I definitely think you need a different type of consultation and different personality type to work with especially since this is your first time considering professional color. I would  recommend and  will be more than happy to set a consultation up for you with Alma Marquez, our Salon Director and Color Director anytime convenient for you. She is very low-key and easy to talk to but knows everything there is to know about color and hairstyling. She's awesome. Our email is hairintlpaloalto@gmail.com, and if you contact me there I can take care of this for you.\n\nOnce again, sorry that Your experience wasn't positive with Carrie, but I'm sure you would be VERY happy with Alma. Just let me know, OK?\n\nHave a great weekend,\n\nPam\n\nHair International"}< /Response>

Terrible customer service. All the women that work there hate each other and it's so obvious too. The receptionists are so rude and unprofessional. The stylists are okay, the thing that I absolutely hate though is when they tell you how you should style your hair. One of the reasons why I stopped going there.<//text>

I notice that you had been to the salon many times before today - was there another stylist in the past that you felt was a better fit for you?

Tazz is finally open again after being closed for months because of quarantine! I love their friendly service, clean and cute store, and drinks. My favorite is the Fog Lifter--not too sweet, comes with breve just how I like my drinks, and nice strong flavor of espresso that is not bitter, burnt, or sour.< /Text>

<text>Staff is friendly, and the reason I'm giving four stars instead of three. I got my coffee order fairly quickly. The Chicken Avocado Wrap took a while, though it was Memorial Day so maybe that had something to do with it. The wrap was just okay, nothing to really write home about. Same with my iced coffee. Experience tells me that non-specialty coffee shops really struggle with making iced coffee the correct way, so I kinda knew what I was in for when I ordered it. I probably would've enjoyed it more if I'd ordered it hot instead of iced.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My favorite coffee on this side of downtown. Staff is always friendly. They made my order correctly and promptly. Clean restrooms. Clean dining space (outside at the moment). Lengthy menu. Wonderful atmosphere.< /Text>< response>

< Review>
Great coffee I had a flat white w soy milk and my husband had a standard flat white.  We were impressed.   America hasn't got a coffee culture like NZ and Australia so was presently surprised and relieved when we popped into Tazz.  I will definitely be back when next in town.  Good job guys</Review>

<Text>A nice and cozy style location with a decent drink selection. One thing I always end of complaining about is their menu tv is so small and with my glasses I can barely read it. Aside from that, the staff are always welcoming and we'll informed on their selections of coffees and teas. Their location is ideal for meetings and one on ones, which is why I tend to be there.</Text><Response>None< /Response><rate>4<//rate><userid>111418192487693662319<//userid><pics>None< /pics><gmap_id>0x80952f6690c9b3f5:0x1ca6ef1dfcb6f430</gmap_id><date>1570377231041<//date><Name>Draggard Arcane<//Name></record></dataset><record>

Girlfriend ordered avacado toast (which staff forgot about) was very simple and plain. Could have achieved the same result in my own kitchen in two minutes. Lemon cake was decent but a little dry. Overall a subpar experience and staff only gave excuses. Good potential but have totally missed the mark.<//Text>< GmapID>

<text>Being an Arizona native and someone who travels throughout Cali for work, it has been tough to find a coffee shop in California where the baristas just “get it”. There is no burnt/ bitter coffee here, just well roasted beans (roasted in house) and good pour over coffee. It’s the best tasting coffee I have found in California during my four years here.</text><Pics>None</Pics><username>John B< /username>< resp>

$15 for 12oz seems a little pricey, to me. But when you compare that, cup for cup, with Starbucks, it's doable.
Good service and a great location on a bank bldg, right on the street. Pleanty of tables.< /review>< pics>

Amazing customer service. Prompt delivery of car return and Follow ups! They are super professional and super caring. They care about your car and your time!

<review>I was involved in a car accident and decided to take my car to Premium for repairs. My car was done on the date they advised.
Car was not only done that date but they towed it to my residence. I was extremely happy they gave me this option!
Leslie was wonderful in the process. She would give me updates.
Will return to them if I’m case needed. Repairs were GREAT
Thank you premium ! ❤️😊<//review>< pics>

If service is king then Premium collision excels. Coupled with quality work you can’t go wrong. I took in my 2018 BMW 530i just before my lease return date and not only did they repair the scratches and damage on my car, they did so with the least amount of stress and 1/3 the cost of what the dealer was trying to charge me. You can thank me later.<//text>

Had a large scratch on my Lexus and didn’t want to go thru my insurance so I brought the car in to Jack at Premium. He fixed and painted it and now it looks like new all for a very reasonable price.

Premium Collision did a super job repairing my front bumper, which needed to be replaced. I was very happy with their professionalism and prompt service. The price was fair and my new bumper looks beautiful. They even gave me a ride to and from my house while I waited and washed my car so it looked gleaming  when I picked it up!</review>

<Review>Premium Collision Center is the best body shop around. Jack and his team are honest and the best at what they do.  Additionally, they stand by their work & treat their customers like family.

My wife was involved in a minor accident that unfortunately damaged the front end of her car.  She was stressed out about finding a repair shop and the subsequent process of dealing with our insurance company, quotes, and rentals.  A co-worker recommended Premium Collision Center and after one call with Jack my wife's anxiety was gone.

Premium took care of everything and kept us abreast of the process as things moved forward. Premium's customer service and attention to detail is unparalleled.   My wife's car came back better than new and she couldn't be more happy.  We have told all our friends and family about the great service we received.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1599835238410, 'text': 'Derrick, thank you for taking a moment to share your thoughts with us.

When I went in for an estimate I was greeted by a team of professionals they were courteous and did not treat me like I was invisible. They said they will work with my insurance company. Once they got the ok from my insurance they called gave me an appointment to drop off my car. Asked if I needed a rental car which I did and worked with insurance company to get approval. When I dropped off the car they had a new e300 Mercedes there. I guess because I had a high end car I got a comparable rental. They kept me posted on the progress and finished a day earlier. Premium’s work was awesome perfect color match and all the gaps were all the same. The car was perfect. I highly

<Text>Please do yourself a favor and NEVER take your car here. My car was taken in to repair the fender and electric trunk door. They had my car for a little over a month and when I got it back the first time I opened my trunk I heard a noise and knew right away something was wrong. I thought maybe since it’s new it’s making the noise but a week later it was still just as bad so I went ahead and called and spoke to the owner. I was asked to take my car in however being that I live at least 20 miles away and have such a hectic schedule I had no time to. As the days passed my problem got worse and it got to the point where I had to force open my trunk door which I had never had to do prior to them “fixing” my car. In addition, my brake lights and rear signal lights were no longer working when I got the car back and I had no idea until I was told by someone driving behind me. Bulbs aren’t out so clearly there was an error there. I called the owner who offered to check out the car and provide a rental if the problem was due to their error which obviously is if my trunk hadn’t been touched or hit again since they fixed it. I don’t have time to be dealing with these irresponsible people who let their cars leave without being fixed correctly especially after an entire month of having the car. Save your time and take your business somewhere else. Will be attaching a video on my yelp review.< /Text>< pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I am very grateful to Premium Collision. They took excellant care of me and my vehicle. Premium Collision went above and beyond what I expected and needed. They made sure I was not inconvenienced in any way. My front passenger door was backed into and Premium Collision repaired it better than new. Superb paint job. Even painted my sun damaged hood as a courtesy. Functions as it should and in addition fixed my broken back door locking mechanism. Drives beautifully. Premium Collision also picked up and delivered my vehicle, and provided a rental car for me. No matter who you speak to you are given top-notch customer service. I can't thank them enough. Premium work and service from Premium Collision. They have your back.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

update: their customer service call me and told me that $289 is already a discount price and the original price is $400.
The guy came seems professional. But they are way too expensive. Five minutes work for a clogged toilet and my $289 is gone. No water overflowing, no dirty work at all. Just for a clogged toilet!</review>

The main sewer line backed up and they had to snake it out. It's an older property with iron pipes so it's tricky. Professional, courteous, and great communication -- would recommend in a heartbeat.</Review>

Called because I had a handy man make a repair to my toilet which turned out to still have the issue.  I called at 5 pm to schedule service for Monday and they said they could have someone out within 2 hours. Awesome, the tech Myles came out and listened to my issues and concerns, and then got straight to work. He was done in record time as the handy man took 2 hours for 1 toilet. Miles was done quicker and got two taken care of. Also tightened up a loose bolt on my faucet. Great customer service, great attitude, and stellar work.

Thanks Myles!</text>

He resolved an issue with a clog and took measures to make sure that the line was completely clear.  He explained what he found and the steps he was taking to resolve the issue.  He clearly explained the cost before starting work.

What I did not expect though was to wake up the next morning and only have lukewarm water coming out of the faucet.  The plumber turned my hot water down to ‘vacation’ setting.  I’d like to know why he would even touch that when he was not called to service the hot water heater at all.  Did he think I wouldn’t figure it out and call him for additional service?  How deceitful and dishonest!

I should mention too that his truck made a large hydraulic oil spill on my driveway that he only wiped with towels.  My driveway is old, but there were no grease spills on it.  Now there are spills in several spots.<//Text>

I called the Roto-Rooter number that I got off of Google talk to a gentleman who set me up with Roto-Rooter they had a window of four hours and they were here in less than 40 minutes I would say it took him about that long to finish it was our toilet was clogged up so yeah I done caught it early maybe something drop down there he said or they were something that would customer wedding everything and he did it great for happy and fusses 7 day warranty so if anything happens to those seven days call him back and they do for free pretty darn good and everything's fine so I would recommend this company especially the employee Mike who was great very polite, professional and everything was done quickly ! Also it was great because we weren't expecting them in there so early and it was just great and we appreciate it very much<//text>

<Response>None<//Response><review>After experiencing great service last week my sister referred us to call Roto Rooter for our ongoing drain issues with the bathtub and toilet.  Fred was very professional.  Fred and Mario worked together as a team to thoroughly investigate the ongoing issue we have had with our plumbing for the last 6 months.  They did not rush through their work.  They were committed on doing a great job and doing it right!  5 months ago we had a private plumber (own company) come out, paid him a lot of money, he didn’t guarantee his work, literary hours after this guy left the plumbing backed up again.  WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY OF WORK, and time taken by Fred and Mario to explain and show us exactly what was wrong.  FRED AND MARIO GREAT SERVICE!  Thanks guys! Highly recommend you give them a call.  You won’t be disappointed.< /review>< gmap_id>

He was very personal and told us to call him if anything else happens.  Bi work really fast and help fixed the plumbing.  They were in and out.  No hassle at all.  I would recommend these two to anyone.  Thank you Fred and Bi for your hard work during these unpredictable time.< /Text>< pics>

After experiencing great service last week my sister referred us to call Roto Rooter for our ongoing drain issues with the bathtub and toilet.  Fred was very professional.  Fred and Mario worked together as a team to thoroughly investigate the ongoing issue we have had with our plumbing for the last 6 months.  They did not rush through their work.  They were committed on doing a great job and doing it right!  5 months ago we had a private plumber (own company) come out, paid him a lot of money, he didn’t guarantee his work, literary hours after this guy left the plumbing backed up again.

First I would like to say Fred and Myles were amazing Plumbers. They were very friendly and did quality work. I had a clogged bathroom sink and toilet. They got the job done in a reasonable time and I say that because if my apartment bathroom plumbing was installed correctly they would of finished quickly. After they finished they made sure they cleaned that area they were working at. I did really appreciate that.< /text>

I called the Roto-Rooter number that I got off of Google talk to a gentleman who set me up with Roto-Rooter they had a window of four hours and they were here in less than 40 minutes I would say it took him about that long to finish it was our toilet was clogged up so yeah I done caught it early maybe something drop down there he said or they were something that would customer wedding everything and he did it great for happy and fusses 7 day warranty so if anything happens to those seven days call him back and they do for free pretty darn good and everything's fine so I would recommend this company especially the employee Mike who was great very polite, professional and everything was done quickly ! Also it was great because we weren't expecting them in there so early and it was just great and we appreciate it very much< /Text>

Your technician Victor ID 7233 was amazing!  What I thought was just a clogged toilet turned out to be a major plumbing problem.  Victor was here for almost 3 hours Sunday night working his butt off!  He was super professional and polite, and had a great attitude.  Thank you Victor!< /review>

Victor (#7233) was great, very professional, and unclogged our toilet without splashing water everywhere (our main fear). Price was reasonable after the coupon we got online, but Victor was the best part of the experience. He gave us a recommendation for an auger we can buy, and let us watch him use his so we know what to do.< /review>

Alvaro & Don were on time & on a rainy Saturday, very professional & completed a difficult Ayres Ave. plumbing project. “Determined” describes their work effort today. Hand-feeding 120 ft wire snake to clean out old black water pipe... taking hours & doing an excellent job. Thanks again & again!</review>

We’ve been having problems with our toilet and finally got it fixed today. Turns out it was a major issue that required several hours of work. Arturo was very helpful and informative. He answered all the questions I had. He was very professional in all his interactions. Definitely recommend!< /review>

The technician was knowledgeable and professional and I appreciate the same day service.  The price, however, was too high.  The service took about 30 minutes and the flat rate was $299.00 (although the technician did offer 30% off.<//review>

I’m giving 4 stars because Josh showed up in the assigned time frame and did the work quickly. He wore his mask while meeting with us as did we to try and lower risk during covid. I took a star off the review for no fault of his but for the company. They never gave us a quote and so at the ends of the work (replacing one washer) they charged us $300. Since we can’t work because we’re in a pandemic this was way our of budget and had they given us a quote we would not have made the appointment. People can barely pay rent and take care of their families right now and I feel we were taken advantage of. I will never use this company again!<//Review>

I had a recent service appointment on 3.16.20 with Bi from Roto Rooter. Bi was an exceptional human who did an excellent job fixing my plumbing issues. He arrived on time, provided me with the options and associated cost to fix my plumbing issues and he worked quickly to resolve the problem. I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to meet Bi and have him help me fix my plumbing issue. I will high recommend Roto Rooter to my friends and family based on my very positive experience working with the plumber Bi from Roto Rooter!< /Text>

Allen is a huge asset to Roto Rooter. He was on time, friendly and just all around great guy. I hope that he goes far with your company, he would be a tremendous loss if Roto Rooter didn’t promote him within the company.< /Text>

We have this shower system that’s 20+ years (hansgrohe) that has become a nightmare to replace because the parts are not made anymore—requiring us to update the plumbing fixtures and so on.  John was assigned to stop by for an estimate of the job.

We really wanted to say thank you for the time,  knowledge and sincere efforts from John.  He was professional.  He was comfortable to have around and took the time to explain what was going on.

Thank you so much John.  He is a great asset and represented your company very well.  He is highly recommended.

<Date>1566418912973</Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) The women who are in charge of organizing the masses are very unpleasant and do not want to do their job, they lie and hide from people, I think it is in very bad taste since one pays a lot for a mass so that they behave like this They should put people who want to do that job and behave well with people. The only good thing here is that the church is very beautiful and the father who touched us was very good people with us

Las mujeres que se encargan de organizar las misas son muy desagradables y no quieren hacer su trabajo, echan mentiras y se le esconden a la gente , creo que es de muy mal gusto ya que uno paga mucho por una misa para que ellas se porten así, deberían poner gente que quiera hacer ese trabajo y que se porten bien con las personas. Lo único bueno de aquí es que la iglesia está muy bonita y el padre que nos toco fue muy buena gente con nosotros< /Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) They are going to end the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant population as well as the Hispanic Protestant migrant. From the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation of the 16th century, a Protestant and rich north of Europe was drawn against a poor and Catholic south. In America it is the same. Protestantism is more democratic and liberal, it does not support dictatorships as Catholicism does and it respects the citizen more. Consequently, it forms a more advanced and wealthy country.

Protestantism offers a radically different view of life from Catholicism. For example, facing the problem of poverty, Catholicism promotes feeding the hungry while Protestantism defends more than giving a fish to give a pole to the poor and teach them to fish. Better that this church be Christian and that the priest instead of being Catholic becomes a Methodist Christian or Episcopalian or Jewish or Calvinist

(Original)
Van a acabar con la poblacion blanca anglosajona protestante tanto migrante hispano Protestantismo. A partir de la Reforma protestante y la Contrarreforma católica del siglo XVI se dibujaron un norte de Europa protestante  y rico frente a un sur católico y pobre. En América ocurre igual. El protestantismo es más democrático y liberal, no apoya dictaduras como hace el catolicismo y respeta más al ciudadano. En consecuencia, forma un país más avanzado y rico.

El protestantismo ofrece una visión de la vida radicalmente distinta del catolicismo. Por ejemplo, frente al problema de la pobreza el catolicismo promueve dar de comer al hambriento mientras que el protestantismo defiende más que dar un pescado dar una caña al pobre y enseñarle a pescar. Mejor que está iglesia sea cristiana y que el sacerdote en ves de ser católico se haga cristiano metodista o episcopalino o judío o calvinista</review>

<Time>1620340553959< /Time><rate>5</rate><Review>My experience was pretty fantastic. I have terrible impressions about dealerships. Obviously, buying a new car is always exciting. But, crunching numbers to get the payment you want can be a dream crusher. Here at Perry Ford, I felt like everyone involved in the process was great. From my initial contact, to being introduced to Jim Johnson "the dream makers" helped me achieve my ideal payment. Had a wonderful time and shared lots of laughs. Thanks guys!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I've been a service customer with Perry Ford Lincoln for some time now and just bought a 2020 F-150 from them last weekend. They made sure that I got the right truck for my needs, helped me get all the possible rebates offered and made the car buying experience hassle free. Harvey knows the business and knows how to treat people right. I love my new truck!< /Text>

I was a little bit leery having not had the best service in prior years at the dealership. This time around was completely different. Jim Johnson was the sales person that helped us. He was patient, knowledgeable, and helped us find a great deal on a new-to-us used car in great shape. Nilton, the finance manager, was super laid-back. This was not the “pressure“ situation I remember from 10 or 12 yrs ago. Very happy with how smooth the process was. We got a great deal.</Text>

Needed to make an appointment for a 15 min job. When I get to the dealership for my appointment they're understaffed with half there staff out sick. What I read online to have my computer set to accept my new trailer break should cost from 30 to 70 dollars. Ended up costing 170.00. it also took 4 hours to complete.
I give the driver Nick that took me home and picked me up later that day gets 5 stars. He was very professional and personable made me feel great. Thank you Nick for making my day so much better.< /review>

<Review>Rudy and Brian were great to work with!  They didn't have exactly what we were looking for, but we were able to build out what we wanted, order it and have it arrive in a quick manner.  We are so pleased with the options they helped us choose and the truck is amazing!  The whole process was seamless and easy and we never felt pressured to do anything that we didn't want.  I would recommend Perry Ford to all my friends, family or anyone who asks about our awesome new truck. Thank you Perry Ford for being so great at customer service and such a long standing business in our community.< /Review><GmapID>0x80ecf0c8c837f2b3:0xb34820fe0439c5a6< /GmapID>< Resp>

<review>My husband and I purchased a car 2 years ago and have been trying to procure our license plates ever since. First they were sent to the wrong address, then back to the DMV, and then we spent the next 2 years trying to get a straight answer from SOMEONE at Perry Ford where they could be.  It was always going to be a call back in a couple hours with the information, but it would never come through. So we would call back a few days later, with the same results, over and over. Always no clear record of where they were, no record of our issues with the plates, and some employees being completely rude and unprofessional. Now, we owe hundreds in late DMV fees. Will never work with these people again.<//review>< pictures>

<text>I had my car serviced here and now I am getting personalized spam calls and letters for extended vehicle warranty from a company that is not Perry Ford. They have my name, number, address, car info and know that my car was recently serviced so Perry Ford either sold or lost this information so now I am getting more spam on top of all the spam calls that everyone already gets. Perry Ford is selling your information to spammers.<//text>< GmapID>

<review>Mike Barnes, Cassidy Enoch and the F&I guy really worked well as a team here. I got a great test drive, the exact spec I wanted and all my questions answered.
The whole process was smooth and efficient.
It seems that people just want to buy everything on line these days.....well I enjoyed the dealership experience so much I recommend these guys to anyone... 5 stars guys and thanks!!<//review><user>105722004195645950887</user>< pics>

This past Sunday, I purchased a 2021 Ford F-150 from Internet Manager Mike Barnes.  Mike was a true professional, answered all my questions and was very honest throughout the process.  If you are interested in a Ford, ask for Mike, he was great.<//Text>

Our car needed and oil change and basic service. Making an appointment on line gave me a little problem so I called service and spoke to a man who set the appointment easily. I don’t recall his name, but I’ve worked with him before and he is very congenial and helpful. When we arrived, the car was taken in immediately. When the service was completed, we were called and returned to the shop.
The car was ready, everything was checked and because of our warranty, we didn’t have a charge.
We have been going to Perry Ford for years and we have always found it a simple process to arrange for an appointment and our car has  received excellent service, without a problem. Incidentally, the salesmen are very informative and do not pressure the customer to buy. They like to help you find the car you want and they are very well-versed in their knowledge of cars on the lot.   We have bee very happy with Perry Ford.</text>

The Perry Ford Lincoln team in SLO were very professional and easy to work with. They provided excellent customer service, were very knowledgeable and patient with me going through the process of purchasing my car. They also delivered my car to my home at no extra cost. Overall I had a great experience!< /review>

My experience purchasing a vehicle from Perry Ford was beyond incredible. Sabrina and Nilton were superstars with helping me get the vehicle of my dreams. I could not have imagined a better experience, and I highly recommend purchasing any vehicle from them. I know I will be back for my next vehicle in the future. Thank you guys so much for all of your help in making the process as easy as I could have imagined!<//Text>

<Review>After getting quote 2 other places for my transmission and def issues, for my Ford F250 king ranch, Perry Ford really came through.  ROB IN SERVICE AND BOB in parts not only make you feel like you're in great hands, but they do it with a smile.  Thank you for getting my truck back on the road and beating the price of your competition.< /Review>< pics>

I went in to Perry Ford after speaking with Mike Barnes and Brian Smith for a couple days. Mike and I did a test drive then he got right to work with getting me approved for my vehicle!
Mike and his finance team worked for hours to get me into the vehicle of my dreams and looked at every possible option for me, and I ended up with a beautiful 2015 Ford Edge!
I would highly recommend this company to any of my friends and family!< /Review>

Harvey was the man!  No bs, straight to the point. Was able to get a deal done on my new f150 over the phone. Saved me thousands off of my dealer in town. Worth the drive. Plus the gr500 in the showroom was cool too.</Text>

<text>On a whim, I decided to search online for any good deals on a slightly used Shelby Gt350. I live in the Palm Springs area. I couldn’t find anything with under 15k miles within a couple hours of my house. I had to broaden my search and I’m glad I did. I found the exact color and specs on an 18Shelby350 that I was looking for with only 6k miles at Perry Ford. It was on CarGurus. I made an inquiry and received a no pressure email from Mike Barnes(Internet manager). I replied back that I was interested, have a GT Mustang to trade, and that I was hesitant to buy something sight unseen for first time. After a few emails, we decided to talk on phone. I was driving to pick up take out food and this entire transaction was essentially completed by time I was home with my food. Mike described the entire process, appraised my trade in, qualified my credit, gave me different payment options approved by a lender, and set up a truck to deliver the Shelby in 24 hours; all before I got home with the food. Was an amazingly simple process. I was given the option to inspect and drive the car when it arrived and if I had any issues I could cancel and delivery truck would take it back to dealer. The car showed up in perfect condition. They registered it in my name for me, included the plates, and drove away with my trade in. I’m never going to a dealership to buy a car again. Thank you Mike and Perry Ford. Got my dream car in 24hrs without lifting a finger. Remarkable buying experience. 🤙🏾< /text>< rate>

<review>We had a warning on our dashboard and our Lincoln app, so we had Service evaluate the problem.
Jeramy took very good care of us in spite of the fact that they were under staffed due to the virus.
He was very helpful and responsive to all of our concerns and questions. He was very patient even though there were customers all over him.
We left satisfied that we will be well cared for whenever we need service for our new car.< /review>< username>

<Text>The team at Perry Ford, including Jim, our salesman, and Nilton, our financing manager, did a terrific job of taking care of my wife and I as we finalized our purchase of our 2021 Mustang Mach E.  They took the time to prepare the car, start the paperwork (having gotten our information on the phone for minimal office time), and walk us through all aspects of both our financing and the many features of the car.

We appreciate the top-tier service we got at Perry Ford and would recommend the Perry Ford team to others!  Thank you Jim and Nilton!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

This is the best ford dealer around
They go above and beyond to make sure everything is done right on time and don’t price gouge you. The absolute best service within 500 miles I’ve used others in the area and they were ok but Perry Ford is just a step up.</Review>

<text>BUYER BEWARE if buying a used vehicle from Perry Ford. We recently purchased a used vehicle from them and during the process a Due Bill for items that needed repair, was created. We left the vehicle with them for what we were told would be about a week, to fix Due Bill items. 27 days later "the truck was ready" and we were able to leave with vehicle, however there were still dents and scratches - that were on Due Bill. When I reached out asking them to complete the job, they kept the vehicle for another week and yet again when I picked up vehicle it still had not been completely finished. When I have reached out to get this resolved they aren't responding to me. I wouldn't recommend purchasing from Perry Ford, but if you do you should assume you are getting the vehicle "as is" even if a Due Bill is
created.< /text>< Name>

{'time': 1617116754207, 'text': 'I am so sorry you feel that way Lori. As you mentioned in your post we most certainly did not sell or deliver your truck “as is.”  We have also met with you multiple times after delivery and addressed additional concerns (including items not on the due bill). When you went over the Due Bill we discussed expectations and the fact you were purchasing a preowned vehicle. The only way we can address the final concerns you have would be to repaint the entire truck, which we would not do. We have implemented new policies to make sure that we don’t sell vehicles before the cosmetic work is done in the future. I am sorry that you are less than satisfied. We do appreciate the feedback, even though we try our hardest to make it go better than it did.'}</Resp>

<rate>2</rate><review>I was disappointed overall with the service at Perry Ford. I made an appointment for 11 am for The Works: oil/filter change; tire rotation balance; fluids, etc. I also asked them to check my alignment since it seemed off. I did not leave the dealership until 3:30 which seems like an excessive amount of time especially since I’d made an would appointment. Also, when I finally got my car, the front drivers seat had a huge smear of motor oil on it. I was running late for work, otherwise I would have pointed it out to the service manager, so I cleaned it as best I could. And the tech pointed out that he didn’t rotate my tires since I did have an alignment issue so it wasn’t necessary to rotate/balance..<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

After looking for a F-250 diesel to pull our trailer it became apparent that they were going to be hard to come by. From LA to Folsom we were determined to get the best deal. We live on the Central Coast and started at Perry Ford. WHY did we go anywhere else?!? We found exactly what we were looking for, Jim Johnson was super knowledgeable and so nice and the finance person, Brian Smith made the transaction painless. Thank you Perry Ford Lincoln we love our new truck! We would definitely do business here again.</Review>

The customer service is top notch. They go above and beyond what is expected from a car dealership. Mike Barnes is the man! He worked with me for a while to find my dream truck and he pulled through big time. I can’t thank them enough for making the car buying process as smooth as possible. I highly recommend purchasing a vehicle through them. 5 stars across the board!<//review>

The best possible service that could be expected. There was a problem with the car when I drove it off the lot and they addressed it and fixed it past operating hours. They also followed up with a call the next day to make sure everything was operating correctly. I can’t have expected better treatment or service. I highly recommend this dealership..<//review>

Was traveling and needed to have some turning signal bulbs changed. Perry Ford and Lincoln service staff was friendly and even switch the TV so my daughter could watch cartoons while we waited. It didn’t take them long and we were back on the road. Of all the Ford dealerships service experiences, I would have to say that Perry Ford and Lincoln was the best in friendliness, clean service waiting area, and choice of snacks. However the only downside was that they lacked a vending machine for beverages.<//review>

The staff at Perry Ford Lincoln was very responsive. I contacted them via email and the chat on their website. I really liked the chat feature and was able to message with a sales person to ask questions and made an appointment within minutes.  Our transaction went very smoothly and we purchased a vehicle on our first visit. Our salesperson Rafael Torres was helpful and handled our transaction well. We felt the price we received on our vehicle was the best that we had seen any where. Thank you Perry Ford Lincoln! We will be returning to your dealership for our service needs.< /text>

Outstanding dealership! We took a road trip to visit family and had to use their service department, James took care of us right away! He went above and beyond to get us back on the road fast. The dealer was clean modern and followed all protocols and we couldn't be happier by how we were treated!

Thank you again James and Perry Ford Lincoln of SLO!< /Text>

The staff at Perry Lincoln in San Luis Obispo made for the easiest car buying experience EVER! From the responsiveness in calls/communication, to the simple pricing, and then with delivery and paper signing... WOW! Darrell took his time in showing us the vehicle and was so knowledgeable...he was wonderful! We LOVE our new Aviator, and the attentiveness they alI gave made the whole experience such a positive one. I highly recommend the staff at Perry Lincoln for anyone looking for a new vehicle.</Text>

<Text>My car broke down on Saturday night
I towed the vehicle on Sunday morning
The service department was closed but the manager accepted the vehicle and gave me a loaner vehicle.
The next day they took care of the car and it was ready the same day.
Great service-thanks

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Service Adviser James Cromer and all staff were very helpful. Our Ford Escape had heating problem when we were on our way to LA from SF Bay area. We left our Escape at Perry Ford, and rented a car to continue to LA. James had our Escape repaired in time when we returned, and even waited beyond 5 pm when we were arriving late on that day.
Thank you James.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>The part I needed for my transmission was thankfully in stock, under warranty, and fixed within about 24 hours. I've taken my car here for a few years and they usually give me really quality small-town service and better pricing than other shops around. My car is a total piece of garbage, but they treat us well no matter what.<//review><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

I bought a 2018 Subaru Outback for my wife from Perry Ford in Sept of 2020 for a price in excess of $30,000...It is now February 17, 2021 and we have yet to receive the Registration and Title for the vehicle.....Every time we call the dealership to speak with the General Manager  the call is either sent to voice mail or some underling who knows nothing, expresses concern, and says they are looking into it. Caveat emptor.</review>

I've been working with Harvey Green at Perry Ford for over 25yrs and he has always taken excellent care of my wife and I, this recent purchase was do to a bad traffic accident my wife was in that totaled her car and thankfully her Edge really did well and she was only bruised and shaken,, that was on a Tuesday I gave Harvey a call a few hours later and had him start working on a replacement, long story short he located the car I wan
ted to surprise her with and he had it in our driveway on Sunday about 2 1/2 hours from the dealership. Thanks to all at Perry Ford that worked to take care of us.....<//text>

I loved my purchase experience at this place. I was looking for a good deal and purchased quick here because I didn’t get a hassle or uneasy feeling. I feel I was listened to and understood. My time was valued and not wasted. I plan to do more business at this location and loved my salesman. Thank you so much!< /Review>

Michael Barnes is a car guru!! Not only did him and Nilton Silveira the financial wizz find me a great car but they got me a great deal. Also from start to finish they couldn't have made it easier on me. Strongly recommend if you need a car go to Perry Ford SLO.< /review>

In short, our overall car buying experience with Perry Ford and internet sales manager Mike Barrnes was friendly, easy-going & straight forward. It was the simplest, least stressful, exciting & exceptional car buy experience we've ever had. We knew what vehicle we were looking for and what price range & payments we could afford. My husband found the exact vehicle we were looking for on Perry Ford's website. He called and spoke with the internet sales manager Mike Barnes. He asked if he would be willing to work with us on the vehicle and Mike said he would do everything he could for us. We made an appt to come in the following day and look at the vehicle, test drive it and discuss the price and payments options. Mike did exactly what he said he would do. He was straight forward with us and worked with us where he could. No pushy "car salesman" tricks or tactics. He presented and explained our options (for loan terms/months and extended warranties) and helped us choose the best one for our family. The finance manager Nilton was friendly and quick with the paperwork. Both Mike and Nilton under promised and over delivered on everything they said they could and would do for us. Even after the sale was over they both provided their contact information and said they would be happy to answer any future questions and if we ever need anything to feel free to call. We wound up with questions for them the following day. We were call back immediately and all of our questions were answered. We could not be happier customers with both the vehicle and the service we were provided. We have nothing but the highest recommendations to Mike Barns, Nilton & the San Luis Obispo Perry Ford Lincoln dealership!<//Text>

<Text>Seemed knowledgeable about my oil change. I had two recalls they said, they would take care of them. They got me in, but couldn't do either one. One might need parts Ford will inform them, the other they need a specialists to take care of.

I dread having to take my ford in.

This time battery issue. I wasn't sure since auto zone told me the battery was fine..... so I make the appointment go in and they come back with yes it's the battery since batteries only have a 3 year warranty they charged me $ 50 to tell me that yes it was the battery....  (I have an extended warranty)

The battery was going to cost so much more than anywhere else and this particular dealership never honors or always finds a way out of honoring warranties, so I bought my battery elsewhere. I actually will be purchasing a new car and will also be buying it else where I'm not being stuck feeling uncomfortable every time I need it serviced.

Buying an extended warranty has never actually paid off for me this is my second car buying it from Perry Ford and last!</text>

Made an appointment online for standard oil change for f150. Line out the driveway when I arrived on time despite the new redesign. After delay in check in, I asked if they could also give me an idea why I've had a noise in reverse for years that they have always ignored previously. Check-in guy said no problem then tried to slide $170 diagnostic fee into the bill. I went for a hike in irish hills, truck not finished 2 hrs later. The waiting room is of course new and nice, which I then got to wait in. 2.5 hours later my oil was finally changed. Good news is, it still seems to run ok after taking it here. In my 12 years of F150 ownership, I have taken the truck to multiple dealerships in the bay, orange county and central valley all who were fast, offered free washes, never tried to upsell and paid attention to details - Perry Ford is the only dealership that can't handle walk-ins and takes 2.5 hrs to do a standard oil change with an appointment. I have been going to Perry Ford for 6 years, but if anyone can tell me who else in SLO takes good care of f150s, I'd go there instead. I've even gone down to Mullahey and had much better experiences down there but need a little closer.<//review>

The auto repair dept. was very helpful with all my auto needs and worked with me to achieve the best possible outcome for me to get my auto damage repaired in a timely fashion. Great employees and great service i couldn't be more happier with thier work than i already am. Tobin was very helpfulI answered every question and proposed new ways to solve issues that dealt with the repairs. .I recommend anyone with auto repair questions give perry ford auto a call. They really do have 5 star service, and put pride in the work they do to get you and your vehicle back on the road as soon as possible. As of now i wont take my car anywhere else after the services they have provided for me,and will refere anyone with automotive needs to perry ford auto ...THANK YOU PERRY AUTO YOU GUYS ROCK!!!!< /text>

My truck failed a smog check st another station they told me to by the part needed to pass smog from the ford dealer and bring back and they would r&r the part retest. Ford mechanic checked it out and did a smog check and passed,saving me the money it would cost for the part (which was not defective)and time for the other shop to fix. I'm very happy with the way the Ford service dept. Handle my situation,they are extremely professional and knowledgeable.</Review>

Perry Ford was great. They were very easy to work with and I especially enjoyed working with Mike Barnes, Internet Sales Manager. I would go back to buy from them again In the future. The service department was also great and did a fantastic job getting my new F-150 detailed for me.< /Text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Purchased an expensive newer vehicle from them a few months ago; initially I thought I was getting a good deal. Though it is not indicated in the Carfax, it appears that the front bumper had been repaired and repainted w/o OEM paint. My local dealer they noticed it immediately. Also, certain parts of the fender were painted the wrong color. Carfax showed they acquired my vehicle in January but listed for sale in May. Hard to believe they never noticed it during those 4-5 months. I was quoted ~$2,000 to have it corrected.
Finally, tires needed to be changed, actually got 2 flat tires shortly after my purchase. Replaced all 4 for around $1,200.
Reached out to Manager to see if they’d do anything about it and received no response. Shame how they cut corners and do dishonest business. Will never recommend or purchase a vehicle from them again.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80ecf0c8c837f2b3:0xb34820fe0439c5a6</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

When shopping for a car I went to several dealerships. Our salesmen Mike and the other professionals at Perry Ford were the only people who actually listens to our wants and needs.
They were upfront and honest and didn’t try to sugarcoat anything.
Mike took the time we need to explain the technology Of our new hybrid car.
Mike was also willing to work around our busy schedule and had all the paperwork ready for us to sign when we came in to pick up the car.< /Text>

I had a wonderful car buying experience at Perry in SLO! Mr. Jim Johnson got me the exact car I wanted for a great price! Everyone on the staff was very helpful and friendly. They went above and beyond to make sure I was well informed and comfortable using the new technology associated with a new hybrid.  I am so glad I went to  this dealer!<//review>

<text>Perry Ford...our salesman Rafael and the finance manager both have integrity.
There was an error we noticed confronted Rafael the next day.  His response was very professional, researched the issue and he consulted  management.  They resolved the situation professionally.  I highly recommend Perry Ford and Rafael.< /text>< pics>

He gave me lots of options to make sure I got exactly what I wanted. What I appreciate the most is even though I brought my farther with me Mike talked to me and didn’t talk down to me. He gave me all the info I needed. I hope he’s not too tired from all the walking around he had to do. It was a wonderful experience and I will definitely go to Mike for my next vehicle.</review>< pictures>

We came in to take advantage of the 0% financing currently being offered on 2019 & 2020 models. We worked with Mike Barnes, the internet sales manager. Mike was very responsive via email, and up front with all information so we could make a well-informed decision in purchasing our vehicle. He was also very patient with us while we loaded up 2 car seats to test drive the Ford Flex we eventually purchased. We were also impressed that he filled up the gas tank while we were doing the paperwork, so we had one less thing to worry about. Long story short, great customer service and a pleasant car-buying experience for a busy family with small kids!<//text>

Wonderful experience having my vehicle repaired. Tobin went above and beyond, from guiding me through the Insurance Claim, to sending handling my rental car, and provided timely updates.

When I inquired about the 2019 Ford Ranger I wasn’t sure how things would work considering everything going on right now. My car guy Mike made the whole process super easy set up an appointment got to check out the truck and test drive it. He didn’t try and pressure me into it even after I said let me talk to my wife first. Went back the following Monday and got my new 2019 Ford Ranger. If you are in the market for a new car go talk to my guy mike at Perry ford he won’t let you down.</Text>

Perry Ford , and  the dealership I bought the truck from dealt with the warranty company, and got my truck fixed even though the warranty company didn't want to pay (which came during  a time due to health issues
I'm dealing with). They saved me thousands.
Great people to deal with.</Review>

I had such a wonderful experience the first time I went. I normally visited a different dealership however I was in a pinch. They went above and beyond to squeeze me in and take care of me. Due to the nice man actually caring for me and my vehicle, I have since returned a second time where he assisted me and i will continue to have service done at this location.  I wish I would have gotten his name to write here but thank you!< /Review>

Our experience at Perry Ford was lengthy, but enjoyable.  Our great sales person Daisy who went out of her way to make sure we were not only well taken care of, but had the answers we needed to make a well informed decision.  Everyone involved in the process was friendly, hospitable, and professional.  We enjoyed doing business with the team at this dealership and would highly recommend then to anyone looking to purchase or lease a new or used vehicle.<//Review>

My experience was not good this time your technician left oil inside the cab of my truck that I had to wipe down and he left a socket hanging from my skid plate if the socket would have came off when I was driving it
could have hit another car and went through their windshield I've been going to your shop every since I bought my truck 3 years ago the inconsistency is just getting to be too much I will probably not be going back</review>

Outstanding service. When I bought my car at Perry in July 2019, the salesmen were exceptional. When I went to get my truck serviced yesterday, the staff in the service department was welcoming and very professional. Even with the unusual times that are upon us, they provided excellent service. I will continue making the trip from Grover Beach to SLO just for Perry.</review>

Staff was very friendly and courteous. However, they were not able to diagnose the problem. Since then my van cuts off as soon as I come to a stop. Its been happening continuously ever since I left the dealership. Now I'm waiting for a call back. Very frustrating!
Update: I did return to the dealership and learned that the 'Auto Stop/Start' feature does not work properly. It needs to be checked out still.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Although I wasn't happy about the oil pan leak on my truck, it was rectified quickly and under warranty.  Omar was professional and helpful,  and as always, Darryl was great!  He helped me with my purchase in 2017 and during this warranty work.  He really is the best ambassador for Perry Ford.  I'll definitely be back in 5,000 miles for regular service!

My experience with Perry Ford was a positive one. My car battery died and as soon as I arrived I was greeted and helped. My service agent was very helpful and very friendly.

I was able to get dropped off and picked up at my location where I needed to be and the driver was very friendly and very prompt!

Great service all around.</Review>

<text>I’m glad we showed up when we did cause we got the perfect car, they go quick. Mike Barnes (salesman) made it super easy and he was a major help with our investment decision. See him if you’re there, he’s been there a long time, he’s very knowledgeable and is super familiar with the inventory so you can see ALL your options. So happy with our 2016 Ford Edge!< /text>< rate>

I leased a Ford Focus in 2017 and return it in March 2020 at the end of the lease, under the allocated mileage. It was a great car. It is now June and they have not completed the paperwork to end the lease for Ford Credit.  So Ford Credit extended my lease, because Perry Ford did not file pay work, and is demanding late fees and 3 months of lease payments for a car I have not had for three months. Perry Ford will not return Ford Credit calls so Ford Credit put a black delinquent payment on my credit report as I am not going to pay for a car I don’t own or have procession off.

Went to Paso Ford to purchase my F150 FX4x4, the service is day and night!<//text>

Over the top. Prompt, complete and vehicle returned to me in as clean a condition when I dropped off.

Follow up the next day by my service writer, James Cormer was spot on.< /text>

It takes over 6 minutes to reach the service department, and after being told numerous times I would receive a call-back, there is no call-back. They are either understaffed, or selling too many brands of cars and can't handle general business. This has been happening since I purchased my Lincoln from them in March 2018. It's really terrible! After this pre-paid service, I will transfer my business to Paso Robles.<//text>

I was locked out from starting my own car after super bowl Sunday when the chiefs won, so I decided to leave shortly after. I had an aftermarket key to start my car but it didn’t detect the correct transmitter inside. My car went into PATS “no start” mode and couldn’t come out of it. I had no idea what to do besides get it towed. The ford dealership at Perry Ford Lincoln of San Luis Obispo was my only option to get the correct key programmed to my car. I dropped it off Monday with no appointment and I got it back Tuesday night so I could get to school the rest of the week. Rob and Mitchell were hands down the best representation of how any ford dealership should handle their customers and workload. I was owed nothing and got back more than I could ask for with a recall for the airbags, two sets of keys programmed and a battery fully charged! Thank you guys for taking my issue, like anyone else’s, and finding the solution for it!<//text>

I feel like I was ripped off very badly. Two days ago my car started blowing hot air out of the driver side vents. Went online to various boards and websites and found that this was a fairly common problem for Ford and Lincolns.
Found out most problems were with a part underneath the dash that regulated the airflow; another solution could be in the software of the car. Not wanting to tear apart the dash, took it in waited over five hours and then they came back and said it was a glitch in the software and they charged me $200 to reload the software. It seems I could have disconnected battery for 10 min and system would have reset to original settings.
This to me was a great overcharge and I will never do business with this dealership again. This was the second car I  bought from Perry Ford and will be the last. I still am amazed that they charged $200 to plug in to the car’s computer and reload some software!< /review>

Tobin was incredibly helpful, attentive, and kept in touch with me throughout the entire process. I didn’t even know there was a body shop on this side of town, but I’m glad I discovered it. Taking your car here will be more than worth your time.</review>

Terrible service to start with. Also right after I purchased my vehicle I was already taking it to the mechanic. There were so many things they didn't mention. I started noticing leaks 5 days after I bought it. No surprise I needed to fix the coolant and oil leak. Just saying wouldn't go here.<//text>

The Perry Ford staff is always very accommodating in scheduling of car maintenance checks.  I am in and out in under 2 hours for basic oil changes.  If more work requires extra time I am notified ahead of scheduling.  I have bought 3 cars from this dealership and have nothing but praise for them.< /review>

Awesome experience at Perry Ford in SLO! Worked with Brian Smith to buy our dream truck and he made the process so simple and easy. I appreciated that they weren’t pushy and helped us along the way. Finance was just as easy with Frank. Highly recommend checking them out for your next vehicle!</Text>

Ford Service has no communications between service department and parts department (even before their remodeling project and the COVID pandemic).  Communications with customer is lacking, had to call 4 times to confirm our service appointment time and that parts were on hand.  Upon being notified of service completion, I found the replacement parts were not even "Ford" parts, an outside contractor was brought in to replace a windshield (not communicated to us until later).  "the works" service for oil change and inspection stated fluids were topped up, and battery checked.  Windshield washer fluid was notably low upon my picking up the car, and noticed a electrical issue on the drive home - stopped and found Battery terminal wasn't tight.   A previous visit at this location left us baffled as the service tech(s) rotated "directional" tires improperly.
Perry Ford SLO used to have my grateful business, but for my families safety and the well being of my vehicles, this was the last straw, they will no longer get my business for anything sales or service.  How they have fallen!<//Text>

I couldn't be happier with the service I received. I was quoted 2 hrs. max time, was given a shuttle ride to nearby Home Goods by Nick, (nice guy).
Called when car was done, picked up by Nick within minutes.
My car was washed and ready to go. Also the staff inside when I checked out was also very sweet. Way to go Ford, Mrs. B<//text>

Unlike other salesman, Miguel was super nice and patient and didn't pressure me into getting something I wasn't 100% happy with or sure about! He showed me all my options and explained everything thoroughly. Peter in financing was awesome as well! As a first time new car buyer, he made everything really easy and painless. Big thanks to all the great people at Perry Ford who helped to make my experience great!</Text>

This was the 3rd vehicle my wife & I purchased from Perry Ford and as always, we were treated with that special small town feeling of doing business with a friend. Brian Smith & Chet Dawson bent over backwards to create a deal to fit our needs & pocket book. We have been customers since 1995 and never been disappointed with them on selling us a vehicle or servicing it.  We wish the best to Perry Ford on their remodel and look forward to seeing it completed. Mike & Judy Green<//review>

< Review>
Harvey Green is an outstanding salesman. He listened carefully to what motivated me in selecting a vehicle and financing it. He was patient while I had to go home and crunch the numbers. In the end I got a truck with the features I most wanted for a manageable monthly payment.  Perry Ford is a professional organization that I can recommend.<//Review>

My wife and I went to Perry Ford 11/23/2019 hoping to find a used car that fit our budget. When we arrived we got a friendly welcome from Eric Cheng who would be our salesman through out our experience. We walked around for a while looking at this and that. Eric was extremely knowledgable about all the cars and even the abstract features some of them had.

We finally found what we were looking for in a 2015 Ford Fusion SE. We test drove it and Eric explained its features to us and drove. When we got back to the lot we sat down to try and make a deal. Eric said proceeded to find a way to make the numbers work... in fact, he managed to shave 3 percentage points off by being creative, which really made us happy.

All in all our experience with Perry Ford was Top Notch... We were extremely happy with the service we got and, of course, the car we ended up with. A big thanks to everyone involved with our transaction, especially Eric! We hope to do business with Perry Ford again.

No pressure sales by Jim Johnson. He and management worked with us to reach a very fair deal on a truck within our budget. Will definitely return to get another vehicle from this dealership.<//review>

The People at Perry Fords service department were uniformly helpful and friendly- couldn’t be happier with them!
On the other hand I’m not too pleased with an ABS pump going out at 60k miles and a rather exorbitant price which
seems to vary by hundreds of dollars at other Ford dealers.  Come on Ford, lets be a little kinder to your customers!< /review>

Even while Perry Ford is undergoing a massive remodel, their service team continues to not only get it all done on time, but they are the kindest crew around. They also enjoy a few laughs & have the best people working with them to get you back on the road safely. It's always been worth the drive from Paso for us.<//text>

<Time>1590792077784< /Time><rating>3<//rating><review>We bought a new Ford Edge SEL in January 2018. It now has 18,000 miles on the odometer and is in IMPECCABLE condition except for the side mouldings. The side black mouldings on both sides were streaked since Jan 2018 and looked like the vehicle's mouldings were many, many years old. I was unhappy w/Perry for not properly correcting the issue two years ago. This month, w/Tobin Flamm's and "Nick's petsistent help", Perry FINALLY ordered new mouldings after 28 months and will install them when they arrive. My advice: HOURS, phone calls, many... trips from Nipomo and persistent pleadings will eventually end in a smile. Ron Miller< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<text>Working with the Perry Ford Service Department went smoothly when I brought in my 1999 Ford F-250.

I brought my truck to Perry Ford because I needed a full diagnostic and wanted original Ford factory parts for the repair. The diagnosis revealed that 4 of the 8 coils had failed and the spark plugs needed to be changed. Their repair  quote was fairly priced and their work was completed professionally. In addition I was given the opportunity to talk to the actual mechanic and he gave me all of the additional information that I needed to know for future maintenance needs.

I’m very satisfied with the Perry Ford service team and would recommend them if you need high quality factory Ford service at a fair price<//text>< username>

Brought truck in for warranty claim. They took photos. Never called me back on the status of the claim. I called them weeks later to find out the person who was helping me no longer worked there so my claim disappeared. Another guy started helping me, he was nice, but overall something that should have been handled in a week took two months...
Maybe cause they are under staffed or the construction.< /text>

Very nice, helpful, informative, not pushy, I really like the smiles, the way they introduce themselves, and when you see something on their website and they have it they make sure that if you can't find it they go get it for you. Such a great group of guys. Thank you Nilton, Brian, and Don.  I had a very good experience and I'm very happy with my vehicle. Thank you guys.  My buying experience was great but I recently been to service.

The guys in service Rob and Rod knows how to inform the customer, solve a problem, as in making  reasonable purchases,  and tell you your choices.  I so enjoyed my service appointment.  They also fun guys and made it a good experience.   THANKS GUYS!!!!< /Text>

Excellent Service! Got an appointment the next day after calling, which is important too me.
James Cromer waited on me! He was polite efficient, and my car was completed on time, if not before! This was 100,000 mile service!  If I have anything to complain about, I would of thought they could of cleaned my windshield as a bird got me coming over the grade from Paso, but that’s most likely expecting too much!  They still get 5 stars from me!<//review>

We bought our truck 4 years ago and were excited to have a local dealership for service.  However, we have a paint warranty issue and Perry Ford is doing nothing to help.  We made an appointment in mid May and the body shop manager took photos to submit the claim to Ford.   Since then, we have reached out at least six times, and no one will call us back regarding the failing paint on our truck.  We will now have seek out another dealership to start the whole process over.  We will also be letting the Ford Co know about the terrible customer service we have received.<//review>

I found 3 listings on CarGurus for some SUV 's at Perry Ford that were what we were looking for. I sent an inquiry & was promptly answered by Mike the internet manager. He was very helpful with info & stayed in touch while we waited for funding. We made an appointment to test-drive the 2 cars that were still available & Mike was very helpful & easy to deal with as were all Perry staff we met. We drove both cars, chose one, made a fair deal & were driving off in our new car in less than 3 hours.  I would recommend Parry Ford to all. We are very happy with our purchase & how easy they made it.<//text>

<Date>1576347337878</Date><rating>3<//rating><review>I have been going to Perry Ford SLO for over four years to have the oil change service done on my car. I trust this Ford dealership more than Paso Ford, which is less than two minutes from my house. I have the oil changes done professionally because I bought the car brand new and I wanted to have the receipts of maintenance for resale purposes if I choose to sell my car in the future.
I always make an appointment, usually a week out. The last three times I have gone to Perry Ford, even with a scheduled service and informing them I am waiting at the dealer for the service to be done (since I’m coming from 30 minutes away and can’t go home) I have waited over TWO hours each time. The service writer was cool enough to knock off the cost of labor this time ($30). I’m not sure if they are overbooking their service department, or if they are understaffed regardless, but no one should never have to wait 2+ hours for just a basic engine oil service. I won’t be going back anymore, I’m just going to be changing the oil myself from now on like I do and have always done on all my other vehicles. It’s just not worth the wait. I thought the first time was a fluke, the second time I got a little upset, third time of waiting over two hours and I’ve got to call it quits. Add in my drive time and I’m spending 3+ hours just to have the oil changed, a service that should take 30 minutes tops.</review>< pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>My wife and I had a collision in car from debris on road traveling north on 101 near Paso Robles. We had our car towed to Perry Ford in San Luis Obispo.

The ford team was outstanding every step of the way from estimating damage and level of repair, coordination with insurance appraiser, providing schedule updates, and most of all being our advocate to return our car to perfect condition including state of the art diagnostics and final road test to deliver a quality product that exceeded our expectations.

First class operation here. Also great job to our repair specialist Tobin Flamm and the entire Ford team assisting us thru this process.< /review><user_name>John Desgrey< /user_name><Gmap_id>0x80ecf0c8c837f2b3:0xb34820fe0439c5a6</Gmap_id><Date>1579546352862</Date><userid>117660513943239961541<//userid>< Response>

From the time i first arrived and was greeted by Tyler Henry who assured me i would have all my questions answered by the time I left, until i left with my 2018 Ford Flex SEL. The salesperson who assisted me was Michael Barn, an excellent and knowledgeable employee, who was more than patient with me and my family. There were many factors at play that day as it was pouring rain and my 18 month old son was extremely rambunctious, but i never felt like our presence was an annoyance. Instead, we were greeted by everyone and were given drinks, snacks, gifts for the children and a high level of professionalism. For all this, my family and I are extremely grateful.<//Review>< gmapID>

He was attentive and helpful through the whole process, I’ve never been happier with customer service. He is the best! Quick and efficient.
I’m in love with my FJ cruiser :)
Thanks Mike!!

Went there with a 2007 Jeep Commander hoping for the best. Drove out 6 hours later in a 2018 Ford Flex. Joseph was very helpful and attentive. Hank fought for us to be able to leave in a new car. Our credit wasn't the best but she worked out a great deal for us. It was a long six hours but Joseph and Hank were right beside us the whole time keeping us updated and informed. Thank you so much. I love my new car =) Merry Christmas!</Text>

Interestingly enough, there were quite a few customers that had been waiting for hours on their cars & repairs. I (luckily) was in and out within 20 minutes. They tested a battery issue I was having and informed me it had gone bad and needed replacement. They replaced it with a new battery that had a 5 year warranty.  The car starts perfectly now and there are no more issues. Jeremy was helping me. He was fast, efficient and kind. He was juggling calls and helping so many people, yet he remained calm and confident and was a true professional despite the hectic Monday rush. The cashier who checked me out was also kind and everyone treated me with utmost respect and attention. I have a feeling that the other customers were waiting so long because the repair shop and mechanics wanted to be thorough and ensure their jobs were done correctly. I would definitely go back to Perry Ford volkswagon if I have any additional issues. They were respectful, attentive and handled a very busy day with utmost professionalism and great customer service. .<//Review>

Very professional courteous. The new manager made it a point to say and wave hello with solid eye contact before entering his office. Nice when managers do that. Omar was top notch with customer service. Attention to detail and well organized. Being a ruff morning for me, Omar’s ability to stop, speak softly and give a firm hand shake at the end of my car service brought me well needed smile. Thank SLO Perry’s Ford.<//text>

The team at Perry Ford the team really made me feel special when I came to pick up my vehicle. The whole process was seamless from ordering to picking it up. Special shout-out to Marco for keeping me posted throughout the whole process. Highly recommend Perry Ford if you are looking to buy off the lot or custom order.< /Review>

<text>We took my daughter’s car in to be repaired, it need a new engine.  So we decided to buy her a car instead. Perry Ford treated us fantastic, everyone  was helpful and honest. We live in Colorado so not being there could have been very stressful. Instead it was s delight.  We will be purchasing our next car at Perry also!

Update: we bought a car for our daughter!  Now we just bought one for me!  Again the guys were great 👍🏼< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Just had my car serviced yesterday.  The service went fast and easy but what made it great was the personal service Omar gave me when he was very busy.  I have not been driving the Escape for very long and had a few questions on how to work some of the buttons on the dash.  He was happy to help me and it make a huge difference.  Thank you to Omar.

I am very pleased with the customer care in the service department. I unexpectedly had to go out of town within a week and needed my car serviced before the long drive. They were able to fit me in before my trip. On that day, I was running late. I called and they assured me that they appreciate their customers and would do what they could to get me in when I arrived.<//Text>

Chris Cammat was great. Didn't feel hurried or pressured to buy the same day we test drove our new car. He was courteous and patient. He didn't shame us and was understanding during negotiations. He got us done and in our new car in about 2.5 hours since we were in a time crunch. The managers were also very nice and helped us with the price since we have a new baby. Overall very enjoyable experience. I would call Chris again.< /text>

I ended up buying my VW out of town because I couldn’t get the sales department to follow up with me so I was nervous when I had to go to service for my first maintenance. However, their service team was excellent upon drop off and pick up. The man took his time to understand my issues, even though it was past 5:30PM and gave helpful replies. They were prompt, flexible and knowledgeable about my vehicles make and model. I’ve only had the 10K mile maintenance done, but so far so good!<//Text>

I wish I could mark it zero stars as that is what Perry Ford of San Luis Obispo deserves oh, they don't even deserve the one star. The reason for this is I was out in California last year for my great aunt's funeral I had service done while I was there. After burying my aunt heading back to Colorado the meanest performed on my vehicle prove to be faulty started leaking transmission fluid on a my transmission while driving in the high desert in Utah and almost got my truck on fire. I was left stranded in the Utah desert on veterans day last year. I've let both Ford and Perry Ford I've San Luis Obispo know this. I also had my truck inspected buy Ford certified employees and they informed me that the maintenance done was improper and almost caught me on fire. And left me stranded. I guess this is how we treat our veterans. I hope everybody takes this warning seriously it is disgusting how this place operates and how they treat our veterans good job Perry Ford of San Luis Obispo.<//review>

We quickly checked out the 2018 Lincoln Navigator, as we had heard good things.  The next day we came back to give it a test drive.  All personnel were very helpful and determined to make sure any and all questions and concerns we had were addressed.  Sales and management certainly listened and worked with us to close the deal...with no pressure.  Processing time was better than expected.  Our new Navigator is above and beyond our expectations...NOTHING there  to disappoint!!!</Text>

<review>What a great experience working with Joseph Schraff.  He was such a good listener and did not try to convince me I needed something different. What I was looking for was not on the lot but he had the exact 2018 Ford Escape brought in and I had my new car in 3 days.  All around, very pleasant people to work with, with one exception.<//review>< Time>

But, in a nut shell they made the stars align for me. And with the help of God they filled  this 30 year old man with unspeakable joy. Truly unspeakable joy! Talk about putting the icing on the cake! With the new year rolling in these unsung heros lit my life up like a personalized firework show on the best night of summer in the middle of winter. I am besides myself. Im still pinching myself to make sure its real. Still peeking out my window to make sure my car is actually still there! I am overwhelmed with gratitude and thankfulness. Thank you guys so so so soooooooo much!!! This place is easily 5stars. Daisy is easily a perfect 10. I will come back and recommend this place to everyone I know. And Way to go up up UP above and way waaaay WAAAAAY BEYOND. Happy New years and blessings to your entire staff and team.

Edit: A year later and these guys continue to knock it out the park with Top service that is second to none. Ive relocated to Sacramento for the time being and wait until I come to visit family just to bring my car by and see all the familiar faces and to get my oil changed and service needs done. Perry Ford has  truly left mark on me and I’ll be singing you all praises for years to come. I cant thank you all enough. Came in for a oil change this 3/18/21 and they made sure my car was good as new. Love love. Love.  These guys. My concerns if any are always addressed and resolved. I feel educated on matters as they pertain to my vehicle when I leave and Im always encouraged to reach out if I have any questions or concerns. You guys rock!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

My service guy, Omar is always great! My only complaint is that I called a couple of times and was left on hold for 15 minutes and no one ever came back to help me so I hung up and tried another day. The next call I was on hold for about 10 mins and then got hung up on. I’m sure not deliberately but still. I called back and told them and they didn’t apologize. Small thing, annoying at those times, but service is always great!<//text>

I really needed to get under my 67 mustang to see where a leak was coming from and get measurements and they put it up in the air and ran it why I looked underneath for free.  I appreciate their help very much, they were extremely helpful and I couldn’t have done this custom repair without them.  I trust them to help me out with my project car when time and money is a big factor.  Thanks again.</Review>

they did the recall work, no communication all day though (was supposed to take 2hrs). I requested a multipoint inspection but no one explained results to me if it was done. Having shuttle to bring me to work was very convenient. Overall, good.</Review>

My service advisor, Cameron, was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I particularly appreciate him keeping me updated on the progress of the work on my truck, since it took longer than originally anticipated, mostly due to added service items that were recommended. I also appreciate the fact that the technician put in extra time on his day off to make sure the work was completed as soon as possible.</text>

I went in to have a recalled passenger airbag replaced and a mechanic supposedly did a "65 point I inspection" that I had not asked for. The mechanic found the "thermostat housing leaking" the replacement cost being $450.00, as well as the air filter and a lightbulb needing to be replaced. I just bought the car 5 days ago and it had been inspected prior to purchase. There were no leaks visible on the ground, nor did the engine heat up. I believe that your mechanic simply tried to upsell me a needless repair. I assume that the recalled passenger airbag was replaced, although it only took slightly over an hour to do, rather than the three hours I had been told on the phone. I think you guys are bogus.< /text>

<Text>Unfortunately I am never going to return to perry Ford. Not even to buy a car! My experience with Perry Ford has been nothing but bad. Honestly when I first bought my vehicle 5-6 years ago they had great customer service then but over time it has not been the same. I’ve gone back multiple times in less then 6 months with a new problem every time. This last was the last straw. My last experience with them is an issue that is not resolved even till this day. When I took in my vehicle I explained to them the problem and that the car was slipping at a very low speed. When they ran tests they said two car codes came up & that I needed a seal on my front axcel & that should resolve it. 1st off I know my vehicle & fixing the axcel had nothing to do with the transmission. So I didn’t question them because they were the “professionals”. $300.00 later they said it was fine. I take the vehicle drive it around & I actually called them in the afternoon with a question to ask & I didn’t even receive a call back. Later that night the car was still slipping. I took the vehicle back in 1st thing in the morning very upset! I had to re-explain to a different gentleman what happened & he even said “fixing the axcel had nothing to do with the transmission.” I then said that they need to fix the problem because I’m not going to pay for something that never was the issue. He then asked me to have a seat in the waiting room & I wouldn’t get charged for another diagnostic on the vehicle. So I waited..... for 3 hours!!! Not a single check in with anyone until I was asked “did he not check in with you?” Mind you I was there since 7:30am. So when I first sat down in the waiting room the mechanic walks in & was given my paperwork & the 1st thing out of his mouth before even doing anything was “her transmission is going out”. 1) unprofessional with discussing anything like that near a client. 2) the fact that he knew before running anything... what else were they not telling me? 3) language & professionalism, something they need to work on.
When he finally came back to present with a brand new problem his exact words were “now that we’ve taken the time to look at the vehicle/ problem you need a new transmission.” Excuse me? Now that you’ve taken the time to look!?!?! So what did you do the 1st time sir?!?!?! Because even your mechanic walked in & knew the problem right away!!!! So as you can tell I was not happy. At the end of it I asked for the managers number & before I left I asked the guy “is this vehicle safe to drive?” His response was “yes and no” so they let me drive with an UNSAFE vehicle.  During this whole experience & speaking with the manager this issue is not resolved and all the manager could offer was to charge me for new transmission around $4,000. I’m sorry but you’re suppose to make this right because now I feel like I’m being taken advantage of because of this.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Arrived at 7:40 am for my scheduled appointment. Was told it should be done around 9:30 and I said "I would be in Perry's waiting room and to let me know when it was ready." A few minutes after 10:00, I went  outside to see my car parked in the completed area. After several minutes, Hugo the service person let me know the car was done and he was working on the paperwork. Another 15 minutes went by and I finally (10:30 now) got and signed the paperwork. I asked since it was a new sync system if someone could help me syn my phone. I was greeted with you should try and if you can't do it Hugo said " he would try and help."  He did get my phone synced and said that the new system had not been road tested, but if I had trouble to come back. Well it did work, thank goodness and except for a few greasy fingerprints, I was on my way.
This was not my first disappointing experience at Perry Ford. I doubt I will come back. This was another in a line of several unacceptable experiences.< /text>

Went into Perry Service for my regular service and to check a few other things. Hugo was my service manager and he was fantastic !!! For years there’s was a service crew that were remarkable then something happened and they left and a less than desirable crew came on board. I almost jumped ship at that point but didn’t because Perry Ford was so good to me since 1990. Well they have a new crew that is fantastic!!! I feel very well taken care of and Hugo went out of my way to make sure all was well!! Thank you Perry Ford for 29 years if taking care of my family!!

I've been a Ford customer since 2005. Bought 3 Fords from this dealership and have always serviced them there. In the last 3 years or so the only work I continue to get there is my oil changes. Now I will be looking for different plays to do that too.

It used to take 45 min to get an oil change. Now, I'm lucky if I can get out of there in 1.5 hours.

In addition, they keep putting a sticker on my window telling me to change my oil in 5000 miles when the owners manual of my car says to wait until the car tells me to do it, or once per year, whichever comes first. Usually, 7500 - 10000 miles.

Last year I had a sensor go crazy on my Ford Escape and they wanted to charge me $150 to plug my car to the computer to find out what sensor was bad. Then they were going to charge for labor and parts on top. I went to a small mechanic near where I live and they charged nothing for the diagnostic which literally took less than 5 min. And replaced the senator including labor for $120.

I am very sad to say, Ford has lost me as a customer.< /Review><Rating>2<//Rating>< pictures>

We purchased a VW with a maintenance package. Ended up not including all that we thought so cancelled it. Now 5 months and 7 unanswered phone calls later the maintenance package is still on our loan. Not only did we have to drive down in person to cancel it because no one would or call us back, now we will have to drive down there to follow up on why it has not been removed because, once again, no one will call us back. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. They 100% do not care to help you once you've bought a car and are out the door. Will tell everyone I know to never purchase a car here.< /Review>

<Text>I have been a Volkswagen owner for more than 15 years and 4 different cars. There is no doubt this is due to the superb customer service that Volkswagen has always showed me. Due to being in the military I move every few years. Every time I move I find a new dealership and every time the experience of going to the dealership for service is the same... absolutely wonderful.
Until this time. My first and last visit to Perry Volkswagen of San Luis Obispo was horrible. The service representative was rude and not helpful. At the end of the service he charged me for the service even though I had a service contract. The cashier was rude and was annoyed that I brought up the service contract. When we went back to the service rep to get the problem fixed he was a jerk yet again.
Safe to say... if the customer service of Volkswagen has come to this I will be moving on to another make.</Text>< userid>

Sam is a very personable, professional salesman and we will use him again. He helped us buy the car that we wanted along with our trade in, all under 2 hours and no hassle.

A great experience the staff and service tech went above expectations. They picked up my wife from work, performed the maintenance as expected. There was an issue discovered that was created by a local Paso Robles car audio installer that had to be fixed due to a dead battery. All this was discovered at the end of the day after the service techs went home. Jeremy called one of the technicians on the road (halfway home) who volunteered to come back and help fix the issue. According to my wife he discovered the problem and took care of it with a great attitude and professionalism. In the future we will schedule maintenance again of our vehicles at Perry Ford Volkswagen Lincoln without any doubt.<//Review>

The quality of work was good. I brought my car in because I had no more keys for it and needed it re-keyed. There were various communication issues and it took 3 weeks to get the car back. Chet, the General Manager for Perry SLO was able to get my car situation cleared up, but it should not have taken that step to get it done. I felt the communication with the service writer HUGO should have been handled much better. It seemed like he had too much going on and did not follow up with the work. I can't say for sure on that end, but I can say for sure on this end that he certainly didn't follow up and keep me informed along the way. It took several phone calls, and he was difficult to get through to. When it came to over 3 weeks, I sat down with the GM Chet and received a promise that I would have my car the next day and that it would be cleaned since it sat out on the open lot for these 3 weeks, presumably without my window sun screen in place, and Chet said they would fill the tank for me. I let him know that I didn't expect more than what I paid for, but he assured me that he would have Hugo take care of those things before I get my car back. The next day they sent the shuttle and I arrived to get my car. I paid for it, and the work had been completed and it was ready to go. I saw that the car had NOT been washed, and found they had NOT put gas in it. I left a note for Chet and checked in with Hugo. When Hugo realized he had made that mistake he asked me to give him time to do it. I had a lot of things to do that day so I told him I could not do it. He asked me to give him half an hour to do it, but I could not afford the time. He did offer to come take my car the next day to do it, but they had my car long enough and I was not going to let it go back. This was an issue with integrity. There are three things I look for in auto service. One is proper price for the right work needed, the second is knowledge and ability to do the work and excellent craftsmanship, and the other is integrity and follow-up. I am not sure they knew how to resolve my problem because it took 3 weeks which cost them ONE STAR, it turned out to be a bit pricey but apparently was within norms for what they had to do, but the one that cost them TWO STARS was integrity and follow-up.< /text>

Mike, the salesperson, was absolutely fantastic. They ordered the Explorer we wanted from another dealership down south. He never BS'ed any answers--if we had a question he couldn't confirm, he would find it for us. The sales manager likewise was honest and very pleasant to deal with. I will be recommending Perry Ford to everyone I know who is looking at new or used cars. The experience was A++.<//review>

<text>I had a problem with the drain in the sunroof of my 2015 Golf Sportwagon. The drain tubes were clogged and my spare tire compartment was filling up with gallons of water when it rained. This may  sound like a simple problem, but it actually can be a complex  issue. Jeremy and Skylar took great care to make sure that the true cause of the problem was diagnosed properly.  Their attention to detail resulted in the most efficient and inexpensive solution possible.  What could have been a nightmare experience turned into a easy fix. We have been working with Jeremy for years for our VW service.  He is always a perfect example of excellent customer service - knowledgeable,  good listener, efficient, friendly,  accommodating, creative, professional.  He is a pleasure to work with.  Something that is in short supply these days.  Thank you Jeremy and Skylar!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I recently took my car in to Perry's collision center and Tobin the bodyshop manager was AMAZING. So knowledgeable, friendly and trustworthy. The finished project exceeded my expectations and I could not be happier. I believe Ryan is the tech who worked on my vehicle, and he did great work. I would recommend using Perrys collision center to anyone I know, and I plan on coming back for all future repairs. Thanks Tobin & team!<//text>

<Review>I just received a flyer to service my car, from Perry Ford. They have forgotten how they wanted $4000.00 for a brake module. They wouldn't put the used one on that I purchased. I had to buy it from them. They also forgot, they quoted me $1500.00 trade in on my 2008 Escape. The module should not go out on a car with 130,000 miles on it. They were all about the $4000.00.
I was not going to ever get another Ford, but ended up buying a Ford Transit. This time Arroyo Grande or Santa Maria will get my service business!

< Review>
New Years Eve and my car would not start.  Problem was battery and/or alternator.  Perry fixed the problem before the end of the day - great!  Service Manager was actively overseeing to ensure no delays in customer service.  Dillon, the shuttle driver was outstanding.  Overall, the experience was outstanding,</Review>

Staff were friendly and helpful, but it seemed that people were missing. The roll up doors opened late and I think work on my pickup started late. My pick was in the drive through for quite a while before the paperwork was ready for me to drive away. Everything else was just fine.</review>

This time I was buying my second Ford transit connect and I was taken care of from head to toe for my car buying experience....it’s got all new employees and management that CARE about you as a person and it shows! The Old Ford management was terrible and I gave them a second chance ONLY because the GM, Chet Dawson, is a stellar human being and I KNEW her could turn that dealership around. He has. So, I bought a car from a dealer I vowed to never buy from again. My experience was wonderful, no pressure, clear, and quick. I was in and out with a new clean car in around 4 hours...ahhh..that new car smell again!!< /Review>

Our primary contact was Jeremy, who from the very beginning was friendly, informative and very customer service-oriented. He was determined to find the exact cause of the issues my VW was experiencing.  He did whatever it took to diagnose and solve the problems - all at a very reasonable cost!  His communication throughout was also excellent.  I wouldn't hesitate to service my car again at Perry, or refer others to do the same. Thank you Jeremy!<//Text>

I have been a Perry Ford customer 10+ years. We have bought two vehicles here and we get all services done with them. In 10 years we have had only one service dispute, and that dispute was settled quickly to our satisfaction. No questions asked.< /Review>

Unfortunately, I came to the body shop due to an accident I wasn't at fault for in my 2019 Jetta, so obviously I was devastated. On top of that, I had to schedule many estimates and coordinate phone calls with both of the insurances. Tobin was very helpful and made the situation a lot smoother by contacting my adjuster directly and taking those phone calls off of my plate. I really appreciated that whenever I needed to bring my car in that there was no wait time, as many appointments start with a wait time of 30 minutes after your appointment was actually scheduled for! --- excellent customer service! When it came to the quality of the work on my bumper, my car looks brand new again! They make sure you are 100% happy with it and guarantee that if something is wrong, they will fix it immediately free of charge.<//Text>

<text>From my first contact with Harvey at Perry Ford to the day I drove off the lot with my new Raptor it was a great experience. Harvey was extremely kind and patient with my indecisiveness and didn't pressure me at all. He found the exact vehicle I was looking for too!
When I went to pick up my new truck, every one from the GM Heath to the finance guy Carson were gracious and helpful. They got me out in no time with ease. Harvey then handed me my keys with a thorough orientation of the truck.
Best buying experience ever!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<text>I purchased a great car at a great value through Perry. I dealt with both a salesperson and Matt the general manager. I had a great experience all around with everyone I met. I received detailed information on my extended warrantee and exactly what it covered and would cost. I have to multi-fold pamphlet right here that lists each and every part that is covered. My vehicle has been in 2 times for maintenance and it's been easy to get it in and both times my high expectations have been exceeded (I'm an Engineer). Jesse orchestrated getting my vehicle in and out and he is the most professional and courteous person I know. I would recommend Perry to everyone I know. Be picky, and look for a vehicle you want. If you don't know what you want, the professionals at Perry will help you figure that out and find you a vehicle on any of there MANY lots.<//text>< user>

I made an appointment for 1030 on Tuesday morning. My car sat for over an hour before anyone even looked at it.  The service department really needs to handle their business.  The only saving grace was Omar my service rep who bent over backwards trying to push things along.  He took really good care of me but I do find it to be unacceptable to make someone wait 3+ hours when they made an appointment.  Hire more people like Omar and clear out the rest of the staff who don't seem to care.</Text>

Here's something that has stuck with me ever since buying a Ford Explorer from Perry about a year and a half ago. We discovered once we got the car home that it was missing the driver and passenger floor mats. This actually happened to me once before when buying a used car, from a big dealer in LA -- maybe the dealers send floor mats off to be cleaned then forget to put them back in the car? Anyway, in this first instance the dealer was very apologetic and sent me new floor mats by overnight mail. In this case, however, I didn't reach out to Perry right away, for the very good reason that our new son was born just a few weeks after we bought the car. It was about six months later when I finally called them, only to be told that the salesman we worked with was no longer at Perry and therefore there was nothing they could do. It struck me as an odd explanation at the time, but I let it go. And yet, I'll tell you what. They sure didn't win me as a customer for life with that phone call. I get that I was reaching out a long time after I bought the car, but I still don't think I was asking for anything unreasonable, especially given the circumstances. Flash forward to yesterday when I'm cleaning out the car and remembering that we never got the floor mats that should have come with it. If I decide to buy a Ford again, maybe I'll go to Perry, maybe not. But I definitely won't feel any special reason to do business with them again, because of that one little moment when my problem wasn't important to them. Makes you think about the little things that create customer loyalty. What could have been a five star experience turns into two stars very quickly.</Text>

<Review>To start, the staff in nice enough...
Fuction, execution, not so much....

Coming up on three hours for tires,  got here at noon and they failed to realize that all of there employees go on lunch at noon. There for, pushing back them even starting on the tires an hour, another hour and fifteen minute later (2:15)  they decided to tell me their balancer is down..... adding another “15 minutes” to take the tires down the street for balancing,  here I am 45 minutes later, 3oclock and they don’t know the status, the car is still up and the tires are no where in site.    Discounted tires+ extremely discounted service and/or priority
Not worth it.<//Review><rate>1</rate></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The staff were very nice and the work did get done on my car so I would've given more stars except for two reasons, one they changed my seat, which I don't understand since they're only driving a short distance and it took me months to get that seat where I wanted it. And two they turned my lights off that are on automatic and since I've had the car I've never turned that off so I ended up  not realizing that they were off because I was in flowing traffic on the freeway for an hour and a half before the traffic let up and I realized that I couldn't see. I can't think of any reason why they would need to turn that off<//Review><resp>None</resp><Rating>3< /Rating><pics>None<//pics><GmapID>0x80ecf0c8c837f2b3:0xb34820fe0439c5a6< /GmapID><time>1540481474961</time><user_name>Teri Bennett<//user_name>< user>

Called Perry on Sat to obtain service on my Ford F-250. We are traveling from out of state, they agreed to fit me in considering our dilemma. What amazing people and service, took care of our truck, offered a great cup of coffee while waiting. Then took us to rental car office, our choice, so we could visit Hearst castle and Morro bay while they worked on our truck!  The best Ford dealer I’ve ever seen in fifty years of auto experience.

Friendly, but terrible service. Took over 3.5 hours to get a service done and I was the one who had to call to see if it was done. Also,
brought up specific issues that needed to be looked into and pretty much was suggested that I just need to bring it back in for another diagnosis. Unfortunately that is the reason I notified a person of those issues, so telling me that is very unhelpful. Then once I got there, continued to have to wait as one searched for my vehicle and had to ask to receive a reciept and document of the diagnosis.

Definitely do not want to return for a service!</Text>

Horrible customer service, not professional and rude. Not only did I waste 2 hours of my time waiting for my airbag to be replaced only to be told that my airbag wasn’t even in stock and they put my faulty recalled one back in, but everyone I encountered there was extremely rude and not helpful whatsoever. Even the women at the cashier desk had no personality, were rude and unapproachable. The only reason I would come back here is to finally get my airbag replaced since it’s unsafe to drive around with a recalled one but even then I am looking for nearby ford dealerships to go to instead. Never will come back here for any other reason... do not recommend.</Text>

I experienced excelled customer service from George, the Manager of the body shop. He worked with my insurance company to cover additional repairs needed, kept me informed of the status of the repairs and my vehicles looks better than new - like the accident never even happened. I highly recommend them, ask for George!<//Text>

<review>Brought car in for airbag recall when they said they had all the parts. Turns out they only had 1/2 the parts. Said they would call us when the rest of the parts came. They did not. Finally we had to go to the dealer to find out what was going on. They said they had the part for 2 weeks. Frustrating.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Just purchased a new 17 Ford ST.  Because of sitting on the lot for a year or so brand new it experience head light oxidation and a few imperfections.  I was able to negotiate a price, get an extended warranty, and get all the imperfections fixed and looking like a new car again in less than a week.  Thanks to Donald and Randy for telling me how they were going to handle the situation and keeping a honest communication between us.  Communication was and is key to me when doing business with a big purchase for delivery.  Paperwork was the quickest I’ve ever experienced at a dealership.  Donald and Doug sold me as a customer and will recommend others to do business there as well.  Thanks again for a quick sale and coming though to gain a future customer.  Todd</Text>

I went in for an oil change on my beetle and walked out with a new Tiguan! Joseph (my salesman) is amazing I had so much fun and it's the car I've always wanted. Nelton, the finance manager was easy to talk  too and he went over everything carefully so I could make decisions on the packages they offer. I've recommended them to many family and friends.<//Text>

Very disappointed. My wife brought our Ford Explorer in because of a problem with the seat belt.  The technicians barely even attempted to fix the problem.  They simply told us we had to buy all new parts without even trying to release the seat belt buckle. I was able to release the buckle and put it all back together myself at home with 2 screwdrivers in 5 minutes.  Stereotypical response to a woman at an auto shop.<//review>

Dropped my car off at 7:30am and was told it would be done by the end of the day and I would receive a phone call with an estimate.  By 2:00 I heard nothing so I called and the service advisor said he would call me back in 5 minutes.  Needless to say by 4 o’clock I still haven’t received a call.  I called back again and was told that service advisor was out and was still working on the estimate.  They close in an hour and I don’t even have an estimate.  I was told that the advisor would call me the next morning.  Of course I didn’t hear from them and I had to call to get the estimate.  Long story short, I had the repairs made and they finally called me at 4:30 to say my car was ready and that they close at 5:30 and if I wanted my car today I had to be there within the hour or I have to wait another day.  I live a half hour away still had to make arrangements for a ride to get there.  They didn’t even offer to pick me up after I spent over $1,300.  Awful customer service.  Can Paso Robles Ford be worse?<//review>

It took me and my wife six calls to schedule our oil change.  And over the phone, I was provided an estimate.  I was told there may be additional items which would need to be addressed like changing the air filter.  They completed the service I requested very well.
However, I was never contacted regarding the extras which were needed (at the time of service) and the total cost was approx.  $150 more than the estimate!  I know it was an estimate, but that seemed to be quite a difference<//review>

Leon approached us as soon as we made eye contact but not aggressively which made us feel comfortable. That morning I had received an email from Matt the Manager too. Leon listened attentively and warmly handed us off to the finance manager once our needs were met. He never tried dissuading us from what he wanted and walked with a sense of urgency. Then brought in Matt who gave us honest attention and thanked us for giving them business. Wow! And the finance manager we sat with also helped us make the best decisions.< /Text>

<Date>1548225435316</Date><Rating>1</Rating><Text>My original review dropped from 4 stars to just 1 star.

UPDATE: My car has been dying repeatedly. I've now had it delivered to the dealership on a flatbed truck around 8 times within the last few years, not to mention the 5-6 times that I had to jump the battery off and drive it in. I finally decided to take it to a different dealership after the service department started blaming me for "leaving the headlights on" and "leaving on the dome light". Neither of which were true. I took it to a different dealership, and they found an electrical issue on the first day of troubleshooting. Hopefully that fixed the issue. Only time will tell.

DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR TO THIS SERVICE DEPT. FOR MORE THAN A ROUTINE SERVICE. NOT TRUSTWORTHY.

Original Review:

My car battery kept dying for no reason. Had it tested locally, and no issue was found with the battery or the alternator. Took it in to Perry Ford. They did some troubleshooting for three weeks. Couldn't seem to duplicate the issue, so now I have the car back... Essentially waiting to break down somewhere.

Just to be clear, I don't hold the dealership responsible, but it is a Ford that I purchased from there. Also, they gave me a loaner for the entire three weeks, which was a nice thing to get. Hopefully I don't have any serious electrical issues in the future with this car once it is out of warranty.</Text>< pics>

So the automated follow up they do to get you to leave a review is intense and annoying, but I didn't actually mean to leave a one-star review... Might have clicked by accident. They did a great job doing warranty work on my van, friendly and no complaints.< /text>

He out and out lied to me about what he was going to do and what he could do. He is the car dealer that you run from when you see him. I loved the guys that work there, from service to sales. I had been going to them and leasing cars for over 6 years when Chet came on board. No Thank you, sad but true I went to another dealership and bought a car. I will miss the service guys, very honest with me.<//text>< Date>

I don’t like buying cars but the outstanding team at Perry made the transaction the easiest, fastest and most enjoyable time I’ve ever had spending money! Taylor Dawson led the team and was warm, personable and professional. Joe Murguia answered EVERY question about the vehicle and Marco Saines made the paperwork go fast and was also very professional yet personable. The three of them provided support to Colby Webb (in sales for 2 weeks) and certainly led by example. These guys are turning Perry Ford into what will surely be one of the top dealerships in the country!<//review>

I had a great buying experience with Greg Lara. For buying my first brand new car, he made it quick and painless.  ALL of my questions were answered. Even after the fact, he still communicates wiith me to see how I am doing with my Flex.  If I have any issues Greg helps me out and even comes in on his days off to help me.   Very professional, very knowledgeable and a great salesman!!</text>

Online appointment system apparently was down. Received confirmation email but they had no record of appointment. Did not complete inspection. Was told my break pads and tires would be checked. They were not. Took it to a tire shop the same day. Had to have pretty much everything replaced. They did not even notice my tailight and runner light were out. Tried to upsell irrelevant items without fixing actual problems.  No when to return sticker (not a big deal, just helpful). This is not the first time I’ve had issues with the car leaving worse than when the car arrived. This probably all could have been fixed is they just shut the online service appointment page.< /review>

Jeremy took great care of me, clearly diagnosed and explained the problem with my Touareg and got the parts in super quick. Dropped the car off Sunday night and drove it to work Wednesday morning even while having to get parts from LA.

The team was very friendly, communicated very clearly and were always available when I had a question. I couldn’t have been happier with my experience!<//review>

When I dropped the vehicle off I saw a quote of half of what the final charges were for no added work or parts. He had me sign a blue sheet at the bottom of the page on a clip board which he covered up all but the signature line with the white estimate sheet. The blue sheet had the doubled amount and he showed that I had signed for those charges. He told me he would reduce the bill $70 off the price gouge bill of $355 for an oil and filter change  that was his final offer and told us to feel free to take our business elsewhere. It was still $90 over the actual charges being they were charging me for work on a completely different vehicle as they had input the wrong vehicle info on the computer. This wasted nearly 2 hours of my time and made a big scene treating me like I was a dumb woman. I am 74 years old and I was lucky my son walked in while I was at the cashier and questioned why the bill was so high.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Date>1504102366076< /Date><review>My car had a safety recall so I set up an appointment for the service and the representative  gave me a time slot about 16 days out. So I  told the rep I needed to have several other service items addresed. When I arrived at the appointment I might as well never have made an appointment. The service representatives handled all customers on a first come first serve method and if a attractive woman arrived, she was quickly put to the front of the list.There is absolutely no organization or system in place to provide quality or timely customer service. I was not treated as a valued customer was told to order the part(s) and bring it in myself to have it installed.<//review>< pictures>

<text>Jeremy was a great service guy...good people person, etc.

I think they were a little backed up that day...made an 8 am appointment online (because I got put on lengthy holds twice on the phone).  My oil changed still took about 90 minutes which seems long to me.

Other than that, your people are all really courteous and helpful, anfthey did a great job.<//text>< user_id>

That didnt fix the problem  I brought it back and you swapped coil pack 7 for 8 and visa versa. That didnt fix the problem  I researched the problem and found a Ford bulliton that said if that particular code was captured that the problem was the intake manifold. I took the car to Paso Robles Ford  I just told them that I had a check engine light. They pulled the code and told me the intake manifold needed to be replaced.

I really like the people at this shop and I think they do good work.  My only problem is they seem extremely busy and they were unable to provide me the concierge service loaner car (as they found they didn't have any available)  just as they were picking up my car.  Since I made the appointment in advance, it was disappointing that they hadn't planned for it and I was stuck at home with no notice.</review>

Rod the service person I dealt with was on top of the issue and made sure my car/radio was working correctly before I left. Another employee helped me get Blue Tooth re-synced. (It was an intermittent problem with C-Max radio periodically not turning off/sync freezing. Hope this fixed it! )</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I’m shocked they even messaged me to give a review. Took several different calls just to set the appointment up because service can’t figure out where the phone is or how to return a voicemail. Dropped my car off at 9am as I had told him when I made the appointment “the earlier the better” and was told a couple cars were in front of me so I told him I’ll go for a walk and will be back, an hour later my sister dropped off hers. 3 hours later from when I dropped my car off she gets a call that hers is done. She asks about my car and the guy literally tells her that mine was less urgent than others because I didn’t specify what time I wanted mine back so they “pushed it to the end of the day” which is 5pm. I call to confirm and informed him I was returning for my car. I heard him in the first place over the phone but when I get there he denies ever saying that and said there was some “miscommunication”. Demanded to have my car returned to me because I had to leave to go to work and he said it just went into the garage against my earlier wishes. Takes an additional 45 minutes to get my car from them. I was there for almost 4 hours, and could have been a lot longer.

I called Perry ford for service on my new F350. The truck only has 7 thousand miles on it. Concern #1  The Valve stem are leaking on the tires & there is corrosion on the rims where the Valve stems mount. Concern #2 The rear seat back was not latching. Cameron took my information and said he would get back to me this after noon, I asked if there was a bulletin on the Valve stem leak and he said no. I then asked for some paper work Cameron said  the computer was down, After 4pm I had not heard for Cameron so I call can not get him on the phone the receptionist says he will call back, NOT, so I go down there and they have not looked at the truck. Cameron gets a Tech they go to my truck and the Tech starts SLAMMING my seat to try to get it to latch. At this point I ask them to stop, I came for professional service if I wanted some one to slam the seat on my 70 thousand truck I could do that my self. I ask again about the Valve stems. I'm told they did not have time to look at it. I ask did any one run the Vin. for a Bulletin, he said no.  Well there is a Bulletin on the leaky Valve stems Bulletin# 47326 , I was able to get this info over the phone at Jim Vreeland Ford  Service.  Do not take you Vehicle to Parry Ford for Service. I will never go back. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL SERVICE DEPT.   PS I Google the back seat latch and had it working in less then 5 min. with out SLAMMING it.

From the time I pulled in until I got my keys they made me feel comfortable and confident.  I went in to have them check on my recalls.  I was terrified as I have never been through this process.  They fixed so many things in one day and my car drives amazing!<//review>

<Text>After leaving Paso Robles Ford and got a drive through Mobile car wash which Jesse had recommended.  It did the trick to clean the white exterior which had been covered by Bird droppings. I drove home with no time to spare.  Picked up a soda and drove into Perry Ford for the service on my  C-Max.  I mentioned that I wanted a quick wash if possible.  (Black cars show the dirt more!)
While the work was done, I enjoyed conversation with other owners while waiting for c-Max service.  Time went by and eventually all cars were finished and to my delight, my car was washed thoroughly and sparkled, the difference was remarkable!  Really made my day!  Thank you Perry Motors Service Department!

Fast forward to October, and my C-Max needed a new battery which had died!  I had needed jump starts to go anywhere.  So I was to met a new service advisor, Omar - who went over the situation with the battery;  to not turn it off until it was where it needed to be to get the new battery installed.  I joined the other customers in the customer waiting room which was an interesting mix of people while we all waited for our cars to get serviced.  I was very pleased with the fast service and the battery was replaced.  Then I went over to Costco to check on pricing for a set of new Michelin’s for the C-Max.  Even with the discounts the tires were still almost $900!  So I went back to Perry’s and talked with Omar and was delighted by his quote of under $900 which included the alignment and installation of the four tires.  So I made an appointment with Omar to return in 2 days and get the old tires off and get 4 new Michelin which would help keep the mileage low.  As set-up by Omar, I returned (but an hour late) for my tires to be installed and the alignment was done.  The  waiting room was packed and they found me a chair!  It was another group of great customers and the time passed by and before I knew it everyone was either finished or going to lunch!  My C-Max was finished and I went into pay the bill.  I was pleased again with the service,  and asked Omar to put the one better tire into the trunk.   He had covered it well (so the trunk stayed clean).   Really impressed with the service, and promised to write this review!  Still amazed by Omar and his attention to detail.  It was a great experience, and I saved money!  Plus I have a spare which still has three times more tread than the other tires.  Great service at Perry’s and will look forward to my next service with Omar making it always an enjoyable experience!   Highly recommend Perry’s New management, and a very committed group there to make their customers have an enjoyable service every time!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Communication was pathetic in the service department. The ladies in the office were amazingly helpful. It was the service manager and another service department member. The manager was rude! He was accusing me of my phone or phone service not working that is why they could not call me. That was a situation on their end not mine. Told me he had to much on his plate to help me deal with the other person working on my car! REALLY!! After i bought two cars off their lot and that is the service i got! Never again will i be treated that rudely!<//text>

<Text>1.  The fuel delivery system repair although terribly expensive
seems to be working fine.
2.  The balljoint replacement and re-alignment has resulted in major steering problems which I honestly think are a hazard to health and safety for me and others on the road.

FOLLOW UP ON BALLJOINT ISSUE!
I called the Service Dept. on Saturday morning and told them about my concerns and they asked me if I could drive the car back in or needed a tow. I told them I thought I could safely drive it back to them and did so shortly after our conversation.
The Service Dept. Rep was very attentive, listened intently to my concerns, verified my complaint about the steering problem and assured me that first thing Monday morning, when the regular service crew returned to work that they would give the problem their immediate attention.
Mid-morning I got a call from the Service Dept. that the issue with my steering had been fixed, the car had been road tested and was ready to be picked up.  I told them I wouldn't be able to pick up the car till my wife got off work.  They asked me where I lived and after telling them they said they would send a car over to pick me up, which they promptly did.
The Service Dept. manager apologized for any inconvenience to me, explained that during the front end repair, somehow air had gotten into the power steering lines and had unfortunately not been "bled off" which caused the serious shaking in the front end when turning sharply left or right.
There was NO CHARGE for the additional work and I have had NO ISSUES with the car since.
All in all I was treated professionally and courteously by everyone at this dealership Service Dept., would highly recommend them based on my experience and will personally consider using them again in the future!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Service department shows a lack of communication. Voice mails aren’t answered, phone calls are dropped, emails to manager go unheeded, web concierge/service advisor link is ignored. Can’t get through on the phone. Service advisor blames anybody else. Car was finished and sat with no notice until I found it.  I’ve been so frustrated in the past I went to Santa Maria instead for service.<//text>

Service department was very nice. Was shuttled to and from my job. But I was picked up 30 min late because the driver didn’t properly record my pick up time and they forgot about me. So that sucked but otherwise it was good.</text>

<Text>The service department is a mess right now. They are operating out of a trailer while a new building is being built. The service guys send texts, yet are extreamly poor at returning texts and voicemails.  I had quite a day with them over a dead battery of all things. I bought my car there, and have had all service done there. But, I will not be back.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I called to make an appointment for my husbands company car.  The bluetooth would not sync and is under warranty.  The first available appointment time was 7 days later,  on a Monday.  When I brought the car in, I stood in  a line - not sure if this was the right line.  Nobody acknowledged any of the customers in this line.

After Ford has the car for 2 days later, (I hadn't hear from anyone) I called.  They said someone would call back.  Nobody called.  On Friday after 2 additional calls, I was transferred to the representative.  He said the had "my paperwork in hand" and was just about to call me. (Last time we had the car in, after several calls to them, they said this exact thing).  The representative said the part had just gotten in and did I wanted to have the part installed - so the phone would sync.  I said I would and that I had had no communication at all from Ford, I didn't know a part was needed.  He said it should be done soon and he would contact me.  On Monday morning (7 days later) I called and asked to talk with the representative for the car.  The receptionist said the car was done.  NO ONE NOTIFIED ME.  I asked to talk to a manager - I left a voice mail for him.  He did call me back, I was unable to answer and called him back.  He never got back to me - 3 days later.</text>

<Review>My F150 was having promblems with a new transmiitran that was just installed by Jim Burke Ford. It took you over a week to get a look at my truck. It only took you one day to firgur out the problem. After picking up my truck from your service department they said that they had fixed the problem. However the truck drove fine on the way back to Bakersfield, but once I stopped my truck and drove about two miles the same problem occurred. So Perry Ford kept my truck for over a week and did not fix the problem. I had to take it back to Jim Burke Ford. Where my F150 is sitting having the same problem< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I can’t say for the sales department but as for the service department, they are unhelpful and rude. They have always treated me like and idiot, I think partial because I am a women but I know plenty about cars so I know what I need and don’t. They take forever and think that they can do anything with your car. I made an appointment for a Wednesday at 830 and by Friday at 5 it still wasn’t done. They are unresponsive when I call and have even put me on hold several times and hung up on me. I have never gotten rude or out of control and they still don’t treat me like a pleasant customer. I don’t recommend coming here if you can avoid it.</Review><rate>1< /rate>< Time>

Terrible Service- if you want your car taken for months without feedback, unless you have the time to repeatedly call and deal with the service manager being on vacation- don't trust them with your vehicle. Also be aware that if they determine that they can try to get you or your insurance to pay for more repairs...they will...and of course, will not be able to work on multiple things at the same time. On the bright side, you have a potential storage spot for a car if you want to travel the globe by boat 👎<//Text>

<Text>I've had my ups and downs with this place.bought two cars from them, did a trade in and had to surrender a lemon to them.they always seem to lose the important paperwork and there are definitely too many departments and no body's obviously communicating.   The service area seems decent enough depending on whose working, the gals in the service office are amazing and friendly!   and depending on the day you can either have your car done in half an hour or be there all day. They do provide a shuttle but I've had some scary drivers before.
I would most definitely go to them to buy a car again in SLO because I've had even worse experience with the Cole dealership next door.

Like I said it's been an up and down experience. Depending on who is helping you, you either feel like your getting special treatment or else like your getting dragged through the dirt.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

We've been a customer of Perry for several years, but our last experience shows the strains of what seems to be understaffing of their service department.  We took our car in on Friday and didn't get it back until the following Friday with about 4 hours of labor.  It had been promised for Wednesday.  It is almost impossible to reach anyone by phone.  We had to drive up there twice to talk to them when deadlines were past with no communications.  There was nothing wrong with the work done, but timelyness and communications was a huge issue.</text>

Wow it was a good experience they were very busy so it took awhile and the finance guy was awesome.But most important the car is badass the fuel economy is unbelievable we went for a 150 mi ride and got around 44 miles per gallon.And Jake the salesman was very informative.And you know what they say if didn’t buy it a Perry’s you paid to much< /Text>

<text>Just bought a brand new VW convertible beetle from Perry VW yesterday and it was such a great experience!  Mike Barnes was amazing!  Very helpful and informative and relaxed - NO PRESSURE!  Loved it.  He really did a great job.  I had to replace my previous VW convertible bug of 15 years and quick and Mike was there to help.  I keep my cars forever so buying new again after all these years had me a little nervous.  But turns out there was no need.   Mike and the whole Perry team made it great experience.  Marco Saines the Finance manager did a great job explaining all my options and explaining why he'd recommend one over the other and was very helpful!  Then to top it all off I was pretty stressed about figuring out what to do with my old VW.  It totally died and needed a new engine but was sitting at another dealership and I had to get it out of there.   Mike, Marco and the Sales Manager all put their heads together and figured out a way to get it towed and taken by a junk yard.   This was such a relief and they didn't have to do it.  I'm so very thankful with their help with this issue.  To top all this off with my purchase I get free car washes for the life of my car!!! AMAZING!   If you need top purchase I'd recommend Perry the team is so helpful, down to earth and nice.  They'll do you right!  Thanks so much to Mike and the whole team!  Love my new car!< /text>< Response>

We had a great experience at Perry Ford Lincoln. We were well informed on all the options for the type of vehicle we wanted to purchase and their costs. Sales rep Kurt stayed in contact with us over the period of time it took to locate the vehicle we wanted and when we could expect it to arrive. We were quoted a trade in value that was kept at the time of the actual trade in. Hoping that the service department can live up to our expectations.</Text>

The staff was very helpful reviewed the different aspects of the knees to my vehicle and the pick up and drop off service makes things easier helps me be able to do multiple things in one day instead of feel like I’m wasting the day waiting for my car .</text>

<Text>Very good sevice department, Rob is very helpfull and polite. Had the car repaired in on day. We have all our Fords serviced at Perry Ford. Since Rob took over it is 100% better. The shuttle service is great also.💖💖💖😎 The bad part was Hertiz telling us to wait at the airport. I told them we are going to be pickedup here in the yard, she said she would call and tell Ford that, the message never happen😥< /Text>< Pics>

We came here to see if there was a Passat, but when we drove up there was a Buick Lacrosse, and my husband said he wanted me to ride in it (,as I had loved my Buick LeSabre for it's comfort, and had recently had neck surgery, and he'd been checking out cars that were most comfortable. ) Our salesman Joseph said it had just been reduced that day and went and got the keys so we could test drive it.  After that,we drove a Passat, as my husband had been driving Jettas for the last 11 years, and thought he'd like to upgrade to a Passat. It had fewer miles, but after we'd driven the Buick, it felt so much rougher that my husband right away crossed it off our list!  The MPG was great, but it was being sold as a new car, and the smooth ride and the price of the Lacrosse, along with the very low mileage decided it for us!!.  Joseph was very nice and helpful and we appreciated his service so much!! We are thankful for our prayers being answered regarding a "new" car, and praise The Lord!!!< /Text>

<Text>This place is fine. They tried taking me into a vehicle that was overpriced. But I guess that's their job.

I ended up buying a 2017 Ford Expedition from Paso Ford and was very happy I did. Had a much better experience at Paso Ford than at Perry.

Perry feels exactly as you would expect a car dealership to feel. Paso Ford feels like a much better place. I think anyone going to Perry should check out Paso and will have a better experience.

I live in SLO but think the drive to Paso is worth it.</Text>< Pictures>

Our truck buying experience was great. We went in knowing exactly what we wanted and we were able to drive it home within a few hours. Our only complaint was that the truck wasn't detailed. The interior was dusty, the engine bay was dirty and there was coffee in the center console. Other than that Chiris Camat made us feel welcome and worked with us every step of the way! Chris and Tyler both deserve a raise for they're excellent service from start to finish! Thank you.

My experience with my personal truck was awesome the lube techs, Daniel and Jeff topped off all of my fluids, made sure everything was running well and tightened down...then when all was said and done the service team of Rob Pendley and Sophia took care of the rest...all in all I give them ALL 10's for the services rendered!<//Text>

<review>The purchasing process what fine the people were great no complaint there, except I was sold a brand new car with a cracked A/C compressor and a heat damaged A/C clutch. I couldn't get to the service department for weeks so I took my car to another local dealership. Every time I've tried to schedule a service, even just an oil change it's at a minimum 2-2.5 weeks before I can get in.

Don't waist your time, there's another local Ford dealership that is more than happy to help you and get your car repaired.<//review>< pictures>

I dropped off my car in the morning then had to go to work. I wasn’t able to pick it up till late afternoon. Little did I know the shop closes a few hours earlier than what it’s says on google (on google it says 8pm) and none of the works told me . I showed up at 6:30 no one was there, I had to pick up my car the next morning. When I picked it up and paid, the guy that rang me up didn’t know how to print my paperwork and told me to come back later. This is why I’m giving them 3 stars. I had my clutch replaced,it was covered by warranty, so it was free, and got my battery replaced, $170. Really pricy place!<//Review>

<Text>I had a really nice first time car buying experience with Perry VW. Sam was a thoughtful and to the point salesman and was patient with me as I learned the ins and outs of buying my first car. Although I had to wait a little longer to go through the finance portion of the sale, the actual sale and agreement was accomplished relatively quickly. I would definitely recommend purchasing your next car through Perry VW.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Was able to get next day appointment for recall and service work. The work appears to have been done, but I'd have to pull apart the car and various filters to see if they were actually changed. :-/

They have free shuttle with GPS tracking so you can see where the driver is, however, they were slow to pickup (took over an hour for the driver to show) and pickup time was continuously being updated without notifying me. Also they send a lot of SMS text alerts, which say to reply with any questions, which seem to never go answered by them if I reply??? Why tell the customer to reply to the message if you aren't going to follow through? Minus one star for lack of good communication.

Compared to other dealerships, their service waiting area is really old, sub-par and small, especially given the high cost of their vehicle services. Coffee machine didn't work, no customer wi-fi, things are kind of old and dirty, etc. All of the surrounding dealers have clean, and adequate waiting areas... it's clear this dealership hasn't been updated since the 70's or 80's. Minus one star.

Overall I give them 3 stars which could be easily bumped to a 5 by closing the loop with customer communications and cleaning up and refreshing their customer waiting area.< /Text>< pics>

A “works “ oil change that usually takes a little under an hour At 1 o’clock. I get there and realize that their entire internet connection has failed and everyone was scrambling around trying to process or update orders. Then it becomes my turn to hand off my car. No wait in a car line.  I was the only one in line. I went into the side office and was asked if I  was going to leave and come back. The attendant told me that they were backed up and it would take a couple of hours to get it done. I said no no I wasn’t going to wait that long just for an oil change that was  Ridiculous and that I would change appointment and just come another time. She offered a ride to anywhere in the slo city but I live in Los Osos outside the city so that wasn’t an option. So I said no no biggie I understand the internet was down and I’m ok with just rescheduling. Then a well dressed gentleman who’s name is Tom,,   come to find out he’s a manager there  heard about our conversation and came to me and asked me to wait a minute and that he was going to make sure that I’m 1 o’clock appointment was  absolutely to be  honored  And that they will make sure that they squeeze me in right now.  He made it happen. Got in had my oil change and was on my way. Thank you Tom for your  professionalism  During a stressful  situation for all and making my experience there a better one. 👍</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Ended up waiting for almost 4 hours.  Poor communication and very SLOW.  Don’t bother making an appointment, just be prepared to WAIT!!!!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Text>Sales department is great can’t say the same for service this is my third time trying it. Last time I had my truck they had it for over a month this last week they had it from Thursday until Tuesday when I called on Tuesday they told Me they had text me the day before which was not true when I showed up to get my truck paperwork was not finished. Perry Ford has done all maintenance on my truck since the day I drove it off the lot in 2014 I took it there about three months ago and asked for brakes and they told me everything was good literally Two weeks later my truck was undrivable due to my breaks I called to get in and they told me they wouldn’t be able to get me in for eight days Perry Ford is notorious for this on schedule maintenance issues. I spent $50,000 on a new truck and every time I take it I for  a warranty issue they act like it’s OK to leave me without a car for several days not cool on top of that if a little plastic knob on any of your items break in your truck they want hundreds of dollars to replace it even when it’s under warranty.  there is a little latch on my center consul which holds the consul open the problem is the little tab broke on it and it makes the third seat on usable literally a 2 mm piece of plastic they wanna replace the whole consult at almost 300 bucks even though there is a part number for this specific little plastic part they refuse to covered under warranty even though they already charged me when I was in a warranty deductible , moving forward I will never use Perry again and I will probably not buy a Ford ever again even though I was a lifetime Ford fanlooking at Toyotas and the Nissans next< /Text>< Pics>

My car entered the service bays for a 20K mile service at the appointed time.  Service was completed in less time than stated.  I was offered a shuttle even though I didn't need it.  I drive some distance to get to Perry but it's worth the drive</Text>

Although the service was good and fairly timely I experienced the service advisor did not communicate the truth about the wait time during the 1.5 hours it took to change the oil etc. I felt that others that were in the waiting area were given the same run around<//Text>

Jeremy (vw service rep) took care of my problem professionally and promptly from arranging a rental car to having the repairs covered under warranty. Thanks to Jeremy and Perry VW/Ford.

Genuine salespeople, little pressure in negotiations, large selection, and overall a relatively pain-free purchasing experience.  Facilities are dated; otherwise, I would have given a 5.< /review>

Have been using the Perry Ford service department to service my trucks for years, so when I decided to get a little fuel efficient car I didn't think twice.  I went to Perry Ford and worked with Randy in the sales department and was in and out with my new car in less then 2 hours and best of all, I love my little Fiesta almost as much as my F-250.<//Text>

< review>
First guy I talked to was nice, but he was profoundly under prepared. I was consequently transferred to finish negotiations with a 'senior sales rep' to complete paperwork. It is very possible this guys rises from the depths of hell to make deals on cars during the day, then submerges back into the ground to be with his dad the devil every night. One of the worst people I have met in recent memory. He treated me as though my existence was a plague onto mankind. Do not support a business that so easily willing to treat people this poorly.<//review>

As an out of towner, My wife and I just stopped by to get info on new Ford Ranger, but  was treated so professionally by Darrel, that when I got back to Big Bear Lake, I decided it was time to buy a new 250 super duty. from Perry Ford. After a few calls and negotiations, Caymen got me into the truck I wanted. Then to my surprise, the dealership offered to drive  it 200 miles to my business. On a  Saturday night no less.  Service remained stellar, all the way through  Nilton in the finance department. They bent over backwards for me.  I'm looking forward to buying my Ranger through them.<//Text>

<Text>I called two weeks ago to schedule an appt. I was  transferred 2 times, before I got an answering machine. I left a voicemail and no one called me back. I called 4 days later to find out that the Voltswagon "appointment setter" was out of town for a week and they could not make me an appt. Only oil changes. Finally two weeks later, I got an appt to only tell me that my car needed $2300 in repairs. Oh and they did not call me to tell me that my car has been diagnosed, I had to call them TWICE, left a voicemail, and decided to just show up and pick up my car. I got back to the shop, and no one had any idea where my car was, and the paper work was not done. I had to pay $170 to have them tell me that my car needed $2300. The next day I went to a different shop and he only charged me $700. Perry Ford is the worsts place to take your car unless you have a warranty.</Text><Time>1531326166250<//Time></record></dataset><record>

They squeezed me in to get an emissions recall completed so I could renew my tags. While there, they identified another emissions issue and resolved it on the spot under warranty. Thanks Perry VW!</Text>

Worst vehicle purchasing experience ever. Purchased a used f250 with perry ford with warped brake rotors, they replaced it as promised except they did not replace the damaged brake pads. Service manager assured me it would be done correctly but when i was there they gave me the run around and it did not get done. THE NEXT DAY THE TRUCK DID NOT START (2 weeks after purchase of truck). Now I’m stuck with a $400 payment on a broken truck. Never doing any kind of business with perry ford</text>

Update: I changed my rating from a 2-star to 3-star because I received a call from Carrie, a customer service rep for Perry Ford to ask how my experience was. When I told her what had happened she was very sympathetic and apologetic and promised to provide my feedback to the team.

Original review:

A little communication can go a long way...

We had an appointment for 8:30 on a Thursday. We dropped the car off the day before the appointment so my husband could be sure to get to work on time and we all drove together from north county to San Luis that day. Then we heard nothing from the service department all day. At 4:40, we called to find out about our car. The front desk didn’t know what was happening with it so they had to call me back. Ten minutes later I got a call back that the car would be ready around 5 and they closed at 5:30. When I mentioned my husband needed a pick up at work as he had no car and we were back in north county I was told, “oh, well the last pickup leaves at 4:45.” It was 4:50. When I said my husband didn’t have a car to get to the dealership the response was, “ok”. No apology for the inconvenience, just “ok”. Thankfully, he was able to find a ride from a co-worker with such little notice or I would have had to make a 3rd trip to slo that day to pick him up and we wouldn’t have made it to the dealership before closing.

If Perry Ford had communicated this delay to us, we could have made arrangements...If they had apologized for the delay, I may have felt that my business mattered to them. I’ll be looking for another place to service my car.< /review>

Good, honest people that work hard to make your vehicle better after it leaves. They had a hiccup fixing a recall on my truck, but they handled it and stayed passed their closing to make sure it got done.<//review>

<Review>Car was there from 1030 for an appointment for an oil change and in cabin air filter replacement until 5 on a Sat. For any experience mechanic it takes only 45 minutes to do said work when i myself, a not experienced mech, can do the same work in under an hour. Thus far this was my first bad experience at Perry Ford. But the service, not by the employeed, but by managment or lack there of was 2 star at best.They booked 30 oil changes with the 3 mechanics on staff that day. That means each mech had 10 oil changes at an hour a oil change in a 8 hour work day. That just sets them up for failure!<//Review>< UserId.>

Awful. Ignored and brushed off by a particular salesman (John) when talking finances. When we agreed upon a price we were told they "ran out of time" and we went home without a deal and were promised we would be called the following day by noon. Come 2pm and we hadnt received a single call nor any updates, so we had to call and leave a voicemail. We called at 4pm and were told he would call us back later. At 6pm we finally received a call, and drove down there even after considering the long drive and the time at the moment, we figured at the price we agreed upon it was worth it. When we got there we were approached with a completely different price that was way out of our price bracket and told they couldn't do any better. Oh well, there's plenty of dealerships out there better than this one. Also the building looks a little run down.<//text>

<review>Perry Ford is AWESOME. In the last 3 years I have purchased a new F150 Pick-up Truck and a Lincoln MKX. I love them both.
I recently had a need to visit their service department for a turn signal issue. My contact was with the Service Writer named Rob Pendley. He was very attentive and it was obvious he wanted to help me not only get my car fixed quickly but to also save me money.
Even after my warranty expires I will continue to take my cars to them-they get it.</review>< Pictures>

I had bought a truck from a dealership out of state.  (not a Ford dealership)   I paid cash and had it shipped to me.  I drove it "two days" and it broke down!  I took it to Perry Ford in San Luis Obispo and they worked on it for a month, they kept me in formed, they rented me a car and assured me that they'd fix it.
They did!!  They were awesome!!  The only problem was... In my heart of hearts I had wanted another truck (still a Ford :)   so Lennie (the service manager)), who was AMAZING  throughout this whole ordeal, in introduced me to Harvey who found me my "Dream truck "!!!  You know us girls like to accessorize and the color needs to pop!!  Lol   My gorgeous burgundy Ford f150 4x4 supercrew is trick! I named her Charlotte lol... I can't even tell you all the ways Harvey Green saved me $$$!  Literally thousands of dollars.  But even if he could only have saved me half, the respectful way I was treated, the care that went into finding just what I dreamed of was priceless!!!
Perry Ford of SLO, you should go!  Especially you ladies out there who are going it alone and Afraid of being taken advantage of,  ask for Harvey green and say hi to Lennie from the lady with the white truck "they had for 1 month!"    ;)    I will never go anywhere else!<//Review>

I took my suv in to get checked because it started shaking every time it would idle. They told me they found the problem and that all it needed was some new parts. Mind you my suv is only 2 or 3 years old, When I got it back my suv is still shaking and now there are times when I go turn it on it won’t even start... I called them that same day i got it back they to me the next opening is in two weeks... Within those Two weeks my vehicle will be out of warranty.<//text>

< Review>
Went to Perry Ford in SLO to look for an SUV to replace my SUV that had over 200,000 miles on it. Was already in the market for a new car and then heard on the radio that they were doing a slash the price promotion where vehicles would be discounted. They would also be selling one vehicle for $199. Arrived in the morning about 8:30 am. There were people already waiting by the door since 4:00 under the impression that the first in line would be able to purchase the $199 vehicle. We were told that initially so we decided to look around at the inventory. Turns out it was a drawing. Every family who arrived before opening would get an extra ticket or two. My husband and I received 2 tickets, one for each of us. We looked at several vehicles with a very nice salesman by the name of Randy Gregory. He showed us several new and used vehicles. We test drove 2. When we inquired about the slash the price deal on the used vehicles, we were told the General Manager would decide the final price on those. Never really got a set price on any of our possible choices. Decided to think about the options over lunch and come back for the drawing. When we came back we told Randy that we hadn't fallen in love with any of the vehicles. Did not win but were told our names would be kept in the hat for the following day for another $199 vehicle. We ended up at the Toyota dealership down the road a bit and traded in our old Toyota for a newer model. They gave us a better price for our trade in than what Ford had offered and I really liked the selection of small SUV's better there. We purchased a small SUV in our price range. The next day after we took in our trade in to Toyota, we went back to Perry with our family who were interested in a used vehicle on their lot. We entered the drawing again. My sister in law walked the lot for over 30 minutes and nobody came out to help her. When it was time for the drawing, the General Manager, whom had also been there the day before told me and my husband that we no longer qualified to win the $199 vehicle because we had got a car the day before. At first I thought he was joking and then I thought  that he thought I was the winner of the previous day's drawing I told him that I had not. He took both our names out of the hat prior to the drawing because we had purchased a vehicle from another dealership. He said the drawing was for real customers. I never did catch his name but if he reads this I'd like him to know that I am a real customer. I had previously purchased a 2005 F-250 brand new from his lot. I had lots of problems with that truck but I still own it. Was considering having some repairs done on it at Perry or trading it in on a new truck to pull my horse trailer. After myself and family were treated so poorly, I will never do business with Perry as long as this man works there. The General Manager was the most unprofessional car salesman I have ever dealt with. I would never recommend doing business there to anyone. After seeing how he treated his customers, my sister in law chose not to pursue a purchase from Perry.<//Review>

Not worth the star it needs a negative in front of it....The absolute worst experience I’ve ever Encountered I don’t know how this place is still in business. I bought a mustang and it has been a nightmare. From the service dept. (not the mechanics) the paper pushers....to the sales dept. all horrible.<//Review>

Joe Frost from the service department gave me excellent assistance. I did not buy my F-150 from Perry but when I called about a leak in my door, Joe found a way to get my truck in before the storm hit. He called me exactly when he said he would and had it fixed very quickly. Next time I buy a truck, I am goin to Perry.< /text>

Seatbelt wouldn't work (twisted). Brought it in and they charged $70 to get it working. Car under extended warranty - said it wasn't covered and charged excessive labor. Other dealers said they would have done it at no cost.<//Text>

Perry Ford in San Luis Obispo is NOT an honest establishment, and I would never take my vehicle there again. My truck broke down and I had it towed there so they could fix the problem. In the end my bill was over $350 for a simple wiring issue, which is fine by me. But then Jesse called me to tell me that everything was done, and proceeded to leave me a voicemail about how I needed an oil change, fuel filter change, and a new air filter...all of which cost a minimum of $90 a piece. I called Jesse back and told him that was weird since I had literally within the past week changed all three of those things myself, in preparation for a long road trip. Jesse then told me that the mechanics were just giving those recommendations off of my truck's mileage. That may have made sense other than the fact that my truck had 133,200 miles on it at the time, which further verified my suspicion that Perry Ford in San Luis Obispo is only out to take advantage of people, which is wrong! As a side note, my truck also have dime sized piece of paint chipped off of it, presumably because my truck would not start so they pushed it to their shop, or just hit it with something while it was there...I give them 2 stars for at least successfully getting my truck to run.<//review>

<Text>Perry Ford is the worst! They suckered me into a full-service maintenance plan that I cannot actually use because their service department has a 2-3 week waittime. When you call and ask for an appointment for the day of or that week, they act like you are the crazy one! Who schedules maintenance for their vehicles 2-3 weeks in advance? I grew up in a Ford family, with relatives owning a dealership, and if Perry Ford were the last dealership on earth, I’d walk instead!</Text>< time>

The service was good but the reason why I’m giving it 3 stars was the fact that I asked for the price of the oil that was being changed on my car and they didn’t tell me the price and they charged me $30 more than usual for my oil change. I would’ve just purchased  the regular type of oil change.</review>

My service advisor, Lenny, was instrumental in strategizing a way to economically fix a potential oil drain pan leak. I have over 240,000 miles on my Ford Escape Hybrid and I only let Perry Ford service it.</Review>

<Text>I'm a Ford Focus owner with a failed transmission (2 times).  1st time,At 46,000 mi tranny shuddering and making weird noise was diagnosed with internal leak.  Fix was to replace clutch assemble. 2nd time at 49000mi Transmission Failure - Service Now screen came up.  They are replacing clutch assemble for 2nd time but nothing else.  Can't see how this will fix the problem.  They are just kicking the can down the road. Service dept is just giving me the run around. Been trying to contact the manager but have not been successful.  The entire organization so far has been unresponsive.  MORAL - Don't buy a Ford and especially don't deal with PERRY FORD.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Took two weeks to replace two tires and an oil pump switch. Poor communication. And they didn't resolve the original problem. Two stars for getting the tires right.<//text>

Nice enough folks, but a) the price they quoted for a transmission replacement was twice what other shops charge, not to mention $170 for a computer diagnosis, without fixing anything; b)  service entry portal was very crowded and understaffed, this with a service appointment; c) the customer waiting area was actively unpleasant: cold, crowded, TV tuned to Fear Factor, for heaven's sake.<//text>

<rate>2< /rate><Response>None< /Response><Text>Terrible service techs I got and oil change and a 52 point inspection and the spare tire wasnt filled up. I say this because I went to go to work today and my tire was flat well ok. So I go grab my spare from my trunk and what do I find my spare tire that a tech signed off on was compleatly flat like not even looked at. I do nit think I will be coming back here. If they didmt check the flat what else was skipped.< /Text></record></dataset><record>
